    "It's just an MOVI believe.",
    "And I just still included the Alpha channels.",
    "So let's see what it is.",
    "It is a oh it's an Avi, but it still just has the Alpha channels and then it is like a 3 second loop I think.",

    "I mean we're doing it literally right now.",
    "I've done on streams because it's still part of the process and.",
    "And now it's something good to just kind of a stream and have people talk to you while I'm practicing different after effects stuff.",
    "If you any questions or need advice or need a helping hand with anything that you want to create.",
    "More than happy to help out.",
    "You things are not easy in after effects.",
    "What is the main set of tasks you think the normal content creators should know?",
    "Let's pull up after effects right now.",
    "Definitely just thinking in key frames.",
    "It would probably be the biggest thing is the looping set up on the file sidora no BS.",
    "The looping is set up in OBS, just in the preference of adding now these the house welcome back.",
    "Good to see dude.",

    "So weird now.",
    "But will get back on that soon.",
    "I do 1920 by 1080 just because.",
    "I mean, I guess that's one thing it definitely know everything thing to know is that you want to have like a aspect ratio that's like 16 by 9 or like 4 by three.",
    "Or I don't know.",
    "Look up industry standard ratio 16 by 9 is pretty much industry standard right now.",
    "And then also just understanding different frame rates, where like if you're making a gift or something you want to use lower framerates like Animations and stuff or just hand drawn animation or tedious frame by frame animation, you're going to want lower stuff.",
    "30 is good, but then once you get to 60 you start looking like a soap opera.",
    "So I normally keep it 24 frames per second which for whatever reason is 23.976.",
    "Classically, so 24 it's the same thing, but.",
    "That's what I have it set to its default anyway.",
    "What's going on?",
    "Hey, Brianne can see you.",
    "Welcome back everybody.",
    "I have a weird set up so I have to go into here to.",
    "Click my my welcome back right now, but.",
    "Here we are doing.",
    "When I check out 99 you today.",
    "Another thing that I would say is essential to now is just the different types of layers you can have so you can have the solid layer which is just like a solid color.",
    "Which.",
    "Comes in handy.",
    "A lot of different times because when I have this composition, even if I change the composition settings of the background.",
    "This is red, so now we have a red competition background.",
    "That and then here.",
    "My name?",
    "Yeah, from image.",
    "How is your name?",
    "That OK, so I'm going to flatten it, but Oh no, I'm not gonna do that.",
    "Do it.",
    "This screen from image.",
    "I'm gonna find patterns this wild.",
    "So I would say this one.",
    "This one, this one.",
    "I want to delete these dudes.",
    "Press delete or something.",
    "How do I get rid of that?",
    "Don't know alt.",
    "I gotta make it more.",
    "I don't want more or less.",
    "Call me right none.",
    "Copy it.",
    "Crimson color theme in an employer, but How do I like?",
    "I want to get rid of these two.",
    "These are these.",
    "These three are all the same.",
    "Delete backspace.",
    "I don't know.",
    "It's not super important, I just wanted to do.",
    "Nothing.",
    "I want it either.",
    "I'm using my dad's office.",
    "They always want you to have five images.",
    "Oh OK, alright well if that's the case then I need to figure out.",
    "Something else I mean, I guess it's not that super important, but.",
    "6969, nice.",
    "How do you see black-and-white if I have less than five?",
    "Yeah, but already have this black 'cause it black is one that would ever going to use for it.",
    "You know what I mean?",
    "This is summer about.",
    "So yeah, what are you guys doing this weekend at big plans?",
    "I'm getting crabs and 2 1/2 hours.",
    "Maryland Blue Crabs baby.",
    "Very excited about it and had them and maybe like a year or two.",
    "But when in Rome, Men Maryland.",
    "Going to do a new composition.",
    "I'm gonna make it.",
    "314 hundred maybe?",
    "Why that number?",
    "I don't know.",
    "Go over here so bunch of useless things open at the moment because.",
    "Why not?",
    "Oh, you didn't last message you download it yet.",
    "Have you played any of it?",
    "Is it any good?",
    "I'm just I'm so disappointed that it's getting not great reviews.",
    "They heard that it's like just so unnecessarily violent that it doesn't feel like it has much of a take away from it because of its violence.",
    "But I love the first one so much.",
    "I just don't want to tarnish.",
    "I don't want to.",
    "I don't want to tarnish it.",
    "I'm not.",
    "Ridiculous, 'cause I still don't get to enjoy it at that point, but like I don't know.",
    "Now I want you to do different things.",
    "Is different layers split shapes in the layers?",
    "OK, my problem is the E then going to be different.",
    "No it's not.",
    "I love you baby.",
    "I love you windows extensions motion.",
    "Right now.",
    "What are you doing today?",
    "Ryan, I am working on a Behance live bumper for hopefully a different Instagram posts that will be on the Behance page but I want to call out different.",
    "Streamers and I want to be at the end to direct them not only to be handled, but also to be hands live streaming.",
    "So.",
    "It is a concept or going to see how it goes, but I need to get some.",
    "Inspiration as to what to animate it as how it's going to be, what's going to land on at the end.",
    "I'm going to make a new one.",
    "Korea.",
    "Made a new composition.",
    "Um made bread competition background, which I'm saying does not matter, ignore that, and I'm going to put Ryan Silvey in white text going to scale it up real quick, so it's just in the middle.",
    "I'm going to create a new composition the same settings as before, but I'm going to be background color blue.",
    "So then when that happens?",
    "Alright, my blue competition thing to remember is that now we take half one which is the one with the red background and I put that in a competition to the red backgrounds.",
    "Not going to show up because the red background is essentially a transparent background.",
    "So solids are really good because they give that background.",
    "If I go on to cop one and do layering these solid.",
    "And I switch it to a pink and say OK, put it under Ryan.",
    "So we want to come to you since I have compound in there and hasn't solid underneath it.",
    "Instead.",
    "Who wasn't working extreme just dropped.",
    "Not sure if it's my end or yours.",
    "For instance, mine isn't working either.",
    "All good here.",
    "It says Wade chat is so good but the video went down for Maine.",
    "That's no good.",
    "Back welcome back.",
    "Do you need me to hit the.",
    "The welcome back button for you.",
    "India.",
    "Also there Holim.",
    "Obviously Derrick H.",
    "Let me know if you want me to repeat anything.",
    "If anything comes up that high gloss over that is more complicated than you would think.",
    "Let me know.",
    "Hum.",
    "Stream is good here.",
    "Can you show how to think a graphic to audio?",
    "Oh like how so like?",
    "Putting like something that like sit on the beat or two.",
    "You can import audio straight into.",
    "Here I'm going to put him in a part list real quick.",
    "I use Microsoft Edge 'cause for whatever oh I'm not logged in on Microsoft edge, it just runs better on.",
    "Microsoft Edge, let me see if I have a media file somewhere.",
    "Have no idea what this is, sorry in advance, said my downloads.",
    "Oh, I don't know it, but that is.",
    "But OK, so even though there's an MP4, it has audio on it and you go to audio.",
    "You can extend the waveform and the waveform.",
    "This doesn't have any waveform.",
    "Apparently it's quite video.",
    "So that's a horrible example.",
    "This, I'm pretty sure is a video of.",
    "Yes, OK, but it has audio that's important.",
    "You go here.",
    "You get an audio waveform, and you're going to get the waveform so you can see talking is happening here and silence is happening here, so it gives you a visual representation.",
    "There is an effect that has beats on it.",
    "Uh.",
    "And you can assign different.",
    "Uh.",
    "Didn't forever ago.",
    "I'd have to look it back up, but there's a way you can also.",
    "Automatically do it and mess with it, but I always find that just.",
    "Kind of doing it hand to hand.",
    "Frame to frame works best for me with music.",
    "Just because you get more of a natural feel to it.",
    "Um?",
    "So I don't know off the top of my head, but I can definitely look into creating like a sort of.",
    "Project with that in mind, these are just generating audience spectrum work performance, but it's something to do with like.",
    "Tying it to a beat.",
    "Yeah, I'll get back to that one.",
    "I'm sorry about that.",
    "Dumb.",
    "But normally just do it to the waveform where it like peaks at the most of it was like something you'll see the song.",
    "You can see the beat in it 'cause it'll visually show you.",
    "And also it will stay the same.",
    "So once you get three you just copy and paste it through all of it.",
    "But What I will do is, I guess I'll just continue to work with.",
    "I know what I had going on and kind of go through different after fix things as I figure it out.",
    "I had my libraries in after effects so I'm I'm taking extra steps right now, bye.",
    "Uh.",
    "I have not gone there yet, but right now I'm just importing everything.",
    "Can you believe that?",
    "Will slacken docs myself as I always do?",
    "Um?",
    "I am going to.",
    "I have sent a thing, general behaves paramount OK.",
    "Oh, this is a premiere project.",
    "Open up all the Adobe programs on stream today.",
    "Which one is this plastic on base?",
    "So what that is is called Overlord and it's from.",
    "Uh.",
    "Mount something pretty.",
    "Overlord Mount Mograph I think.",
    "Now.",
    "Or From battle axe and sorry, but it makes it really easy where you can just go and like take shape strome illustrator and plop him into after effects and then I have like this connection where then you can send it back and forth and add it as keyframes.",
    "It's super helpful I might be doing more of it in a little bit but it's $45.00 but it is.",
    "120% worth it.",
    "It's such a great.",
    "So such such such a great.",
    "Thing.",
    "So.",
    "I'm gonna say offline all.",
    "See how this cool things up.",
    "Paration for Minnesota and more attractive community now.",
    "Cool, What is this at the very bottom?",

    "I put it in the asset.",
    "And that thing.",
    "Go ahead and put it in.",
    "Here are actually making new.",
    "Section here and I'll say resources for extremely.",
    "Here.",

    "I didn't bring my PlayStation with Maine.",
    "I tried to get to mute before that happens, but it didn't make it in time, so apologize for sneezing into the microphone.",
    "OK, so let's go this down.",
    "And position.",
    "Yeah, this sounds more.",
    "Then I didn't check what she was in the first human.",
    "I think it also that the cumin or the Kimon.",
    "Also, I was very sad when I turned on my computer today, I lossed 130 typefaces because.",
    "Some type foundry I forget which one pulled all of their tape off of Fontbook today.",
    "They had advertised that they were going to do it like a month or two ago.",
    "Sadly, I think.",
    "I think there's like released a statement or something, but.",
    "Copy and paste in the hex code, but old Deb old habits die hard.",
    "So I'm going to make this keep science all at one, since I have an extension called Overlord.",
    "And.",
    "It.",
    "Ooh, maybe because I can't really put Monday or Friday in here 'cause I wanted to move.",
    "Maybe I'll just do streaming and it'll like continue to go through.",
    "So let's check it out.",
    "I'm going to use this thing called Overlord.",
    "We can push over different stuff.",
    "Uh.",
    "From illustrators without having to save it out.",
    "Also, it's really weird.",
    "I don't have a microphone 'cause the microphone is my headphones and sound like you still like having to talk and go like this as I work, but.",
    "It's really strange 'cause I don't.",
    "Have That limitation.",
    "Emotions over here motions another add on that I have.",
    "This.",
    "Technique that I just did is me just Fria assigning the anchor point.",
    "That's a great one.",
    "OK, this is something to know about after effects.",
    "This is your anchor point.",
    "No matter what you do, it's going to reference that section.",
    "Oh Yo.",
    "Victor Nu\u00f1ez.",
    "Thank you for following them.",
    "Welcome to it.",
    "So if you go into the contents of this path, it will see it as an anchor point, which is like.",
    "You can move around.",
    "You can move around, but as you.",
    "Edit this layer and you add rotation to it or even scaling.",
    "It's really important as to where that anchor point is, because you see the scaling this way is different is going to come at you differently.",
    "It's also going to rotate around a singular point.",
    "That was a mistake, but I love it.",
    "Ooh I love that though.",
    "That's fun, OK?",
    "Alright, we'll figure it out.",
    "It's fine.",
    "I like I only feel like I get financial emails when I am Austrian.",
    "I promise you, it's the only time I ever get action.",
    "Or maybe I'll just make these moves like make two of them on the side.",
    "And then have the one that says Monday to Friday on the left.",
    "'cause I'm going to have my head over there and I need to make sure that it's visible.",
    "Alright, then put Monday here.",
    "Um?",
    "Profit.",

    "Trying to think of what other things are super essential that seem.",
    "Quote Unquote straightforward in after effects me.",
    "Um?",
    "What are things that come from?",
    "Illustrator.",
    "Follow after effects after effects in illustrator or more siblings than after effects in premiere.",
    "And I say that because.",
    "Things like a line and messing with graphics is alot easier.",
    "That has a bunch of bounding boxes for his Premier is more linear.",
    "And video editing.",
    "There we go.",
    "So am I A Line?",
    "Dialogue menu on the top right and I can.",
    "Edit what I want to bring it to you so I can do the selection of the composition.",
    "The selection is going to divide it in between them, but if I click outside the competition going to divide between the entire area, like if I do it, center is going to send it to the composition.",
    "But if I do selection.",
    "I can have them all moved to one another, so if I center it, it's going to center UM as a line of objects rather than entering into the Commission itself, so that's a good one, you know.",
    "Set the plumber.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Don't know if it's going to be beneficial, but I'm like maybe they'll make more money off of it, but part of me is also just thinking I don't know.",
    "It just doesn't seem like a great idea for limiting Accessibility, especially during service session for it.",
    "But then again, maybe that's why maybe they need to make money because of the recession, so.",
    "I don't know.",
    "Needless to say, I'm not going to go out and buy a bunch of the font family.",
    "I'm just going to find a new typeface that is acceptable, so they leave me as a customer.",
    "I don't know what's that saying.",
    "Maybe big design studios will not see it that way and I will go out and buy all the type things, but for me I'm just going to.",
    "I'm just going to use something else.",
    "This is what I want to spend $200 on the type when I have big sister free ones.",
    "You just download it working on my last client product that I'm off until Wednesday.",
    "Take a few days off.",
    "Gotta keep away the burnout.",
    "Keep away the burnout also known as you just want to play a lot of that but.",
    "This is great.",

    "Each.",
    "Thank you.",
    "See.",
    "Cool.",
    "Imagining things.",
    "If I'm gonna do is I'm going to 1st save expensive, yes?",
    "Streaming in order to say.",
    "I know I don't know if it needs to be like a bee hand flies.",
    "You got me?",
    "Yeah, right you see.",
    "Everything you have to let me know if it's worth getting.",
    "If it's worth getting, then if you tell me that you play it, you know like I don't know if they would be talking about.",
    "Crap, I trust your word more than some stranger on the Internet, but also be awesome.",
    "Let me know how it goes.",
    "I want to see where the story goes because you know, they kind of have a bit of a not a cliffhanger, but definitely desire to figure out which way the direction of the story goes.",
    "At the end of the first one, I don't want to say, just get down to play it and they're planning on playing 'cause it's like 1 just came out but.",
    "The first game is just so good.",
    "It was so good.",
    "You Z.",
    "So they have been answered and socialize.",
    "Hum.",
    "Maybe rather than that, we created to be b.net/live.",
    "Yeah OK, so will have.",
    "I'm going to bring in an all air again.",
    "Also, do you have any cool ideas for type here fresh cake?",
    "Do you see any good inspiration lately for type animation?",
    "I wanna look it up.",
    "I can't even look at it together.",
    "Let's check it out.",
    "Let's check it out, baby.",
    "Also, derricks also live here on.",
    "Check him out if you look at for new people.",
    "I'm going to say tight anime short just type.",
    "And they'll go creative fields.",
    "This is cool though.",
    "Click on that looks cool and I like the volume going to appreciate that already.",
    "Love it, I love it.",
    "That's great.",
    "Who party looks like definitely two party like I don't know having to poop.",
    "When is high?",
    "Thank you.",
    "Welcome back also Edison, thank you for following.",
    "Could have you.",
    "We are live every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday.",
    "And we work on motion graphics.",
    "I'm doing a portrait challenge which is kind of taking a bit.",
    "Um?",
    "So I think also really important in emulators.",
    "Let's say schedule legally.",
    "For making motion graphics for video, should we be creating full frame transparent background say well 80 by 1080 for?",
    "I normally do 1920 by 10, eighty 1280 by 1080 is like like kind of older screens.",
    "You want that wide screen aspect ratio.",
    "Um?",
    "They are normally 16 by 9.",
    "Like your TV is probably in 16 by 9.",
    "Ratio.",
    "Oh, that's still 16 by 9.",
    "Alright, 'cause I typed in mind 'cause I'm, uh.",
    "But we were you meant 1920%.",
    "OK cool, cool, cool.",
    "Uh.",
    "Next song, please.",
    "Next song, don't ask again.",
    "Don't want to use Microsoft Edge.",
    "Also you guys can see all your stuff here.",
    "How to change this library?",
    "Oops.",
    "Turn off after they saw by solid FX.",
    "Hey, what's going on?",
    "Did you see you?",
    "Oh my God, your question about streaming what's allowed?",
    "Any advice about music resources and what's allowed?",
    "Yes, pretzel rocks is a great reference of commercial free music.",
    "They're really good at providing different radio stations in genres for commercial free music, and no monster cat, I believe, is also.",
    "Commercial free in the sense of commercially license.",
    "But I would my one word of caution would be.",
    "Remember that music was always changing and basically an artist can be commercial free for five years and then they get signed, you know, and then they buy their whole catalog and all of a sudden all their stuff is owned.",
    "It suddenly under and it's weird.",
    "So right now as advice, what we're saying is we're saying use pretzel rocks or monster cat, I switched over to artless personally, because I also do video editing.",
    "For freelance and having that resources like a student of the year, but you can use all this music in any commercial stuff, no matter what, no matter what your audience is a matter.",
    "What goes on in any project.",
    "So when switch got hit with all those DM CA strikes that a week ago, I finally pulled the trigger and I bought the subscription.",
    "What was the answer?",
    "Yes, you said.",
    "Should be getting a full frame transparent background, say 1280 by 1080 for HD.",
    "Well, I mean you don't have to make a transparent background when you make it.",
    "It's all automatically transparent.",
    "If you're planning to put that on something later, it'll automatically get rid of the background unless you make a solid.",
    "So like.",
    "All I have to do is like this is the default even though it's red for us, it still is transparent when you go and you add it to your render queue, which is a whole another set of systems and you go to output module.",
    "You need to make sure that RGB an Alpha or put together if you're going to take that video file and send it elsewhere, put it elsewhere where they can't dragon in after effects composition or they can, you know, bring in some sort of.",
    "Computer.",
    "Rendering software or OBS or something.",
    "If you want to have it as a movie file, you go in and you save it as RGB an Alpha and that way you can put that on anything and it still video.",
    "Have a good party?",
    "Did you guys know that in like ancient Roman times?",
    "I think is ancient Roman toilet?",
    "Areas.",
    "I think about it.",
    "Yeah, look at this.",
    "Look at this look at this.",
    "You used to just like hang out on a toilet together, which is wild.",
    "Like they're just these strange holes I offered around you.",
    "Hang out with your buddies.",
    "Then you just take a poop isn't how wild so strange.",
    "Like obviously I think maybe these have been restored or something.",
    "So look the same.",
    "But this is like the authentic.",
    "You just like talking to to mark and.",
    "You ever see like like they just all hang out and have a conversation?",
    "Yeah, we had social weird Heidi browser.",
    "Also I don't know what this is happening.",
    "I don't know if they're getting watered and drink or their washing something.",
    "Or maybe that's how they cleanse themselves.",
    "I'm not entirely sure, but that is.",
    "It's like it's everywhere and like it's not even like it was, like urinals.",
    "It's like you're sitting down.",
    "You're going for it.",
    "Where you hang out.",
    "Something about me?",
    "Let's check it out.",
    "See if we can.",
    "Good cool titles.",
    "Nice nice nice nice.",
    "So the kind of dissect the goon, that's how they introduce different type.",
    "That's really neat.",
    "How much even go about doing that?",
    "I mean, I guess maybe just like separating them into shapes, cutting them up in illustrator and then just having a place together in place.",
    "No, but the stuff actually so you guys can see it better.",
    "This is so flashy.",
    "Thing is though.",
    "OK, yeah, so I see Mario there but for some of these other ones I like don't even realize they haven't seen a name in awhile.",
    "Like I really have to search for it.",
    "So do monk.",
    "Steven oreilly, but even David was really quite clearly see it.",
    "Interesting to say the least.",
    "Would you like to flip now?",
    "That's cool.",
    "I haven't thought of that.",
    "Flips into like that video and A.",
    "Cool.",
    "Do they have recently had text that built like this a bit going to use masks?",
    "Why is there a front hole?",
    "Is that so you can fit it if it drops?",
    "Oh yeah, yeah, I don't know why there's a front hole through it.",
    "Just love it up.",
    "I don't have it open music list out of it.",
    "Yeah, I don't know why.",
    "Why is the front?",
    "Maybe because it because it then would be.",
    "A year and all that he wanted to be.",
    "Not entirely sure.",
    "It's funny that I've been listening to art list this week.",
    "I'm starting to like know the.",
    "Turn to know the different song.",
    "Like I live far.",
    "Is on the top 10.",
    "Send me the kinetic tape.",
    "Tell me more who, who, who, who who?",
    "That is so fun.",
    "Oh, I love this.",
    "I wanna throw up.",
    "Guys good who are you?",
    "Did earthmate accidents happen?",
    "Yes, phenomenal.",
    "I hear something powers.",
    "That's why the world knows.",
    "Maybe I should have kinetic tape challenge and find my portraits just because I don't have access to my tablet right now 'cause I have it behind me, but it's.",
    "Kind of the 3D light.",
    "That's really nice.",
    "This is also very nice.",
    "Um?",
    "Or do we make the motion graphics just the size that and let the video software handle the positioning?",
    "Yeah, I just normally make it the size of whatever I'm working on, so if it's a pop up let me say that I can pull up some of my other projects that we can walk through real quick.",
    "Who you drinking?",
    "A gin and tonic?",
    "Nice I am drinking.",
    "Coca Cola Before Quarantine, I had really kicked most of the idea of drinking soda.",
    "Now I'm back at it.",
    "All right?",
    "Brian.",
    "I'm always worried I'm going to find a way to docs myself, but you guys seeing my files.",
    "But I don't think I have yet.",
    "Settings.",
    "I said it's not.",
    "We can hop around.",
    "Google Drive pull up some different things alright so.",
    "Following animation OK, let's pull this up.",
    "He's epidemic sound for YouTube, but haven't thought about how that applies for a live stream until just now.",
    "Thanks, yeah no, it's interesting, it's weird.",
    "Oh, this is what I want to.",
    "Yes it is OK.",
    "So the way that I built.",
    "This dude.",
    "I have a main composition says everything put together at the end.",
    "You'll see that it's like.",
    "It is just the size that I need to be eventually and then I can place it in.",
    "The only time I was saying 1920 by 1080 is just because like that.",
    "Is the standard pretty fairly entering the whole screen?",
    "If you're going to be under props and stuff, you can definitely just make the composition whatever, so this is 605 by 620, which is a weird ratio, but you can see even if I increase it at all, I mean.",
    "But in my main competition I have my :) and then I'll come back text circle.",
    "The reason I have text circle on its own?",
    "Is because oh originally I had it do this thing and end up getting rid of that.",
    "If it was going to like word, build a text but.",
    "It looks like I just have it only know it does OK and I just spin at the same time.",
    "Yeah, and if you look at these key frames.",
    "Have scale so nothing.",
    "Super big fat the size I wanted to be stays in the size that I wanted to be.",
    "This is saying all right.",
    "Between these two I wanted to stay the same size, then from here I want to get big real quick and then get tiny so it looks goes nothing big normal.",
    "Normal big nothing or not.",
    "Not not that normal big normal.",
    "Though it has that animation, but then all while that's happening I have a rotation key frame that is from here that says I want to be not rotated at all and then as I continue to move this across the screen you can see that these numbers are changing 'cause it's rotating.",
    "There's another keyframe off site.",
    "Over here that it is like working its way so.",
    "When asked him what kind of music do you listen to?",
    "Mow says his discord and which I'm using.",
    "Sometimes we also, if you're interested, yes, which I need to add a new song that I really like on there.",
    "Myself with a nice room.",
    "Thanks.",
    "It's not mine.",
    "I wish this was my room.",
    "Um?",
    "Why is it called?",
    "What do you think about it?",
    "I think man.",
    "What do you think about?",
    "Tiny weird things.",
    "Song.",
    "I'm doing this on my Spotify.",
    "Here is our recent thing of all my.",
    "Recently that added to my own.",
    "Play list I can't play any of them.",
    "Think about things.",
    "This is a funny song and it's really funny.",
    "Music video.",
    "And I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to put it in the discord.",
    "Don't switch, don't switch done.",
    "Some just don't do anything that you need to do.",
    "I'm going here.",
    "Plot that bad boy in there.",
    "I love all of these things.",
    "Everything here is phenomenal.",
    "This makes me angry.",
    "Just wait until you Start learning the regular artists on there.",
    "Yeah, I know you're right there with me.",
    "You probably know all this stuff.",
    "You are going to start going to concert to people who like.",
    "Yeah, I heard you stuff on heartless man.",
    "That's This is phenomenal.",
    "Absolutely phenomenal.",
    "Good word looks like a lot of efforts of planning.",
    "Let's put in all of them.",
    "Yeah, that's just wild.",
    "So he didn't, he said go back to 95 over this drama in our lives.",
    "He hasn't, he said, drawing his life for 25 years.",
    "1995 was the last time he didn't have any drama.",
    "You might want to look at.",
    "You seems like a chronic problem.",
    "It's very cool.",
    "So I'm gonna put some easy's on this interesting one of the designers at.",
    "The hands already did a little bit of designing, so I don't want to.",
    "She kind of has just like popped and then pop up so.",
    "But I like the idea of H.",
    "Maybe like spinning.",
    "The ANC E kind of disappearing this turning into the slash or oh wait no I don't need to slash there.",
    "Were were.",
    "And follow me on this.",
    "But I could be wrong though.",
    "I'm a fan of that pixel full effect on text, right?",
    "Like the idea of being on a mess around with different points and having it be adjusted accordingly to emerge into different like condensed or not.",
    "Dance is really neat.",
    "OK, so let's try this ifido.net/live.",
    "It says the same typeface or is this like Helvetica or something?",
    "Are you the same?",
    "Are you the same?",
    "You're not the same, are you?",
    "Same, are you not?",
    "The same you Helvetica?",
    "I think your help now may be here very similar.",
    "Enough so that I think I'm a girl.",
    "Get away with it.",
    "OK, yeah.",
    "I define my favorite.",
    "I'm using it for whatever reason, the.",
    "Website for art list works significantly better in Microsoft Edge, Windows Chrome and I don't know if it's a plugin that I have or or what.",
    "So.",
    "So we're going to actually push this H back.",
    "So.",
    "Ask to illustrator.",
    "And cut it in half.",
    "Divide this baby.",
    "I'm going to keep it together until.",
    "You don't want it together anymore.",
    "I have that selected.",
    "I can click this.",
    "Go to my Pathfinder into divide.",
    "100%.",
    "I don't understand that.",
    "I still group together.",
    "I don't want to get together.",
    "But it shapes two layers.",
    "Center anchor points yet.",
    "There's that copy center.",
    "He counted divided.",
    "But yeah, we have a whole different collection of different songs and you know we have everything that we talked about as well, but.",
    "Yeah, make sure you check it out.",
    "I wish I could play on stream, but unfortunately.",
    "The music industry has not caught up to the future.",
    "So.",
    "You gotta decaf.",
    "The other day he kept either day is Irish.",
    "I think he Kathy I'm not even a TI person.",
    "I do coffee, water, apparently soda.",
    "Lights out of hands.",
    "Let's see here.",
    "Nothing is moving at all.",
    "'cause I think is key frames, but I want to want to duplicate this command Z Control D.",
    "I'm going to make it different color for my reference.",
    "Gonna make it ugly lime green.",
    "And I want to just lower the Opacity ever so slightly.",
    "Hey Derek, thank you for following the work.",
    "Cool, yeah now how are you guys you guys?",
    "Coca Cola or Pepsi through?",
    "OK, so I mean that you like it and I brought on the pass key because what I want to do is I want to take a position key frame and control the underneath of it and I want to use this as a reference.",
    "Let's say Let's make it.",
    "5 second animation.",
    "Uhm, I want to make sure that it lines up for whatever I end up.",
    "Picking.",
    "Ford speed so that way.",
    "It loops.",
    "Now.",
    "We talked earlier about like what side the loop was on.",
    "If you make the composition the size of your loop, it'll automatically loop when you play in after effects.",
    "So I'm going to go ahead and get rid of their preview line.",
    "It looks a little bit like that.",
    "Hopefully it'll look perfectly and it says, which is great.",
    "Coke 00 I know people that like Diet Coke more than regular Coke and I've never been able to get on the train.",
    "Also, in high school they were only allowed to give us to caffeinated drinks, so I had Coke 0 for like 4 years when I was really into soda in high school.",
    "Now I just remind your high school now.",
    "Should I unplug the body from coffee so you don't get headaches when you don't drink so much coffee?",
    "Now was that you needed it?",
    "No is my friend Dan.",
    "I was like, Yeah now I should cut down my coffee.",
    "I'm at like 2 cups a day now he's like why are you joking?",
    "Just kind of footwork like here at 4 cups of coffee at 80.",
    "Kidney stone Don't do that.",
    "Stop.",
    "I'm going to the same thing where I'm going to bring this to make it weird color go and bring down the opacity of it.",
    "Now, did you see there's a new Pok\u00e9mon snap coming out?",
    "To make this run faster, I mean it's farther away, so that cares you know.",
    "Let's see how it looks.",
    "Yeah, maybe maybe maybe, maybe baby.",
    "Maybe I'm doing some more over like this.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yeah, so I guess yes.",
    "Liking Diet Coke is like liking salad.",
    "I don't think they have the same it like they have the same health qualities.",
    "Even the diet is in the word.",
    "I still think you're better off joy salad.",
    "When is staying off of captain at the moment, no, I'm amping it up baby.",
    "Bring all my vices on.",
    "Along time ago I tried a coffee machine from an office.",

    "This may be.",
    "I want to be a morphis.",
    "Amorphous blob.",
    "But I also want that amorphousness to be controlled by effects and not random key frames because.",
    "Actually, both definitely have their way of being weird.",
