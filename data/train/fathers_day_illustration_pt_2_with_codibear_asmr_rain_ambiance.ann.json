    "You know I noticed yesterday.",
    "Um for some reason my mic was peeking really bad.",
    "Um, on my stream bot I was watching it and I'm so sorry about that.",
    "I didn't even realize that it was speaking so bad so I'm going to move my mic back a little bit farther today for some reason.",
    "Maybe I'm just talking louder recently, I don't know, but anyway, um, happy Tuesday.",
    "Everyone.",
    "Thank you so much for joining us again.",
    "Welcome.",
    "Renata and Mariam Welcome to the stream today.",
    "We're going to be working some more on, um, uh, the Father's Day illustration that we started coloring yesterday.",
    "Hopefully we're going to finish it.",
    "We probably should, I feel.",
    "Uhm, hey Jennifer, how are you doing?",
    "We definitely should finish it.",
    "I don't think that it's going to take Me 2 hours to finish coloring this and then afterwards I'm sure will probably have a little bit of time left and then will continue to work on the sushi.",
    "The sushi pattern that we started.",
    "Why does it feel like Wednesday?",
    "You know, with covad my husband has like every other day off right now and he has the day off today an I keep thinking that every time he has the day off, it's the weekend.",
    "It's like throwing my whole week.",
    "Uhm so yeah.",
    "So I'm like I'm like, super confused.",
    "I sat down like I knew it was Tuesday but I sat down and I was like wait is it Saturday?",
    "No it's not.",
    "It's Tuesday.",
    "It's only Tuesday.",
    "Let me know you guys if my mic start speaking.",
    "Oh the son just came out, didn't it?",
    "It's finally stopped raining become from tropical storm.",
    "Um was it called?",
    "Oh my gosh, I just totally blanked on the name Crystal Ball.",
    "It was like pouring last night, but my power never went out again.",
    "But I think we are in the clear with Chris Wall now the son starting to come out.",
    "Anyway, OK, so we left off yesterday.",
    "Um man, my mic is peaking, still isn't it?",
    "Is my gain turned up or something?",
    "Like I didn't change any settings on my Mike and now suddenly.",
    "Seputar testing testing.",
    "Maybe I'll just turn down.",
    "Maybe?",
    "Maybe that will help a little bit.",
    "Maybe I'm just talking too loud.",
    "OK, so like I was saying yesterday we left off with.",
    "We were working on his little his little legs here, so I'm probably going to start adding the little details on his shorts.",
    "He's got little cargo shorts in my sketch.",
    "Let's see where is that layer?",
    "It's right here I think, yeah, so let's go to the outline layer.",
    "And I'm going to use.",
    "The strong clear mode normal.",
    "We can hear you, it's OK, OK, great, uh, let me know if my mic start speaking again and welcome to the stream Alexander.",
    "How are you doing?",
    "Happy Tuesday.",
    "Are you working on any fun projects or anything?",
    "Should be like that and probably wouldn't be able to see any of the lines, or actually I'll probably be able to see this little one right here.",
    "So now let's bring up that sketch that layer.",
    "There we go.",
    "Now he's got little details in this cargo pants.",
    "Your voice is clear, cool, awesome.",
    "Um, think about it.",
    "Erase this little line here, and I think I'm also going to erase the claws on just this hand, because it looks a little odd.",
    "I don't know.",
    "Maybe it's just me, but it looks a little odd having his claws be on that curve for some reason.",
    "I also noticed this morning I was looking at this year and I was like why does this here looks so thick like it looks so.",
    "Full and I realized it's because I did not follow my sketch when I drew this little line here.",
    "I need to bring this in.",
    "And also I forgot to draw.",
    "This little line on the other side too.",
    "Here.",
    "Actually need to bring in this line a little bit more.",
    "Like that and.",
    "Just get rid of that transparency.",
    "Let's change to clear blending mode and let's erase a little bit of his ear here.",
    "There we go OK.",
    "That'll probably help it.",
    "Yeah, now it doesn't know.",
    "It doesn't look so fat.",
    "Finish my downloads.",
    "Oh yeah, I did I did see that on um the hands working on yet another meal with lemons.",
    "That should be.",
    "It should just be a theme Jennifer.",
    "Just all of all of the meals that you make.",
    "Have lemons in them or on the side.",
    "Hey guys, welcome to the stream.",
    "How are you doing?",
    "I can't stay long I have an important appointment appointment.",
    "So good stream to you and your viewers.",
    "Thank you and see you soon.",
    "Thank you so much for stopping by as I hope you have a good time at your appointment.",
    "OK, so I'm kind of debating on what color I want to make.",
    "The Dad's shirt, uhm?",
    "I might just make it the cream color the same cream color that the kids shirt is, uhm, but I don't know.",
    "I think I'll make.",
    "I think the dad's fur is probably going to be the same color as the football, so maybe we should just start with that.",
    "Uhm, it's going to be underneath this layer.",
    "Go to normal blending mode.",
    "Wanted to do a darker.",
    "No, actually.",
    "Um versus leg.",
    "It needs to be underneath this light, whoops, whoops.",
    "Undo needs to be under.",
    "This layer there we go.",
    "Actually, let's see where is this shirt?",
    "Um?",
    "But the there's this shirt layer.",
    "Hello.",
    "Oh my God, I totally forgot to finish my thought there, Jennifer.",
    "When I was talking to you.",
    "Um, I think the lemons look a lot better, um.",
    "I was actually considering grabbing it and grabbing your file and bring it into Photoshop.",
    "Just come to see just so we can look at the difference.",
    "If you want me to do that, I might be able to give you some more pointers or something.",
    "But yeah, it looks a lot better.",
    "I assume you it looked like you kind of lower the values a little bit.",
    "On the lemons.",
    "Hello.",
    "If you want to continue the PSD version, oh sure.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Why don't you send it to my email?",
    "At codybearscave@gmail.com Um?",
    "And uh, maybe?",
    "Maybe I don't know.",
    "I guess we'll see.",
    "Maybe if we have time at the end of this stream after we're done with this, maybe I'll pull it up and we can go over it.",
    "If not, I'll do it next stream.",
    "I've never really had like.",
    "A uhm?",
    "Critique section on my streams before, just because I've never felt confident enough to give people critiques.",
    "Oh yeah, that contrast looks really nice, um?",
    "But I will certainly do my best.",
    "I'm not an expert by any means.",
    "But I will gladly help you with the knowledge that I do have.",
    "Trying not to let that impostor syndrome kick in.",
    "I need to erase this little bit here.",
    "There we go, my tummy is grumbling already.",
    "Time is it.",
    "It's 817 yeah.",
    "Need me some food.",
    "Hey Tony, Welcome to the stream.",
    "I wanted to paint like this but I'm too lazy.",
    "Hey, you know I call myself.",
    "I'm a pretty lazy.",
    "I'm a pretty lazy artist too, you know, like so many artists out there have like sketchbooks, and they draw all the time I totaly understand being a lazy artist and not wanting to do those kinds of things because I never sketch.",
    "Oh, I never I never practice as much as I should.",
    "I totally get it.",
    "OK, now let's do.",
    "Let's go back to this layer an let's draw in the muzzle.",
    "Dads muzzle whoops, wrong color.",
    "It.",
    "Not actually shorten his muzzle just a little bit so we still have that contrast between the pants and the muzzle here.",
    "Might just shorten it just a tad.",
    "Yeah, I'm going to.",
    "I'm going to shorten it just a little bit, so we still have that.",
    "That space of the dark Brown.",
    "Between the pant leg and the muzzle.",
    "Yeah, that's better.",
    "And let's.",
    "Oh come on photo shop.",
    "Not again, not today.",
    "Um, let's go back to this layer.",
    "There we go and go back to normal blending mode and color that right.",
    "In cool it looks good.",
    "Yeah, that's looking cute.",
    "I like that.",
    "I like the color the color difference.",
    "Yikes, didn't realize the image was big.",
    "What out of curiosity?",
    "What are the dimensions?",
    "An what's the DPI also?",
    "Because usually, uhm.",
    "I'm usually able to email myself my Photoshop files, so I'm curious.",
    "How big yours is?",
    "Let's see.",
    "So I need to make this layer pretty much underneath everything actually.",
    "Like this one, this one is going to be read.",
    "Should I do?",
    "Oh, actually, you know what I should do?",
    "This arm on a separate layer because I need to.",
    "Do a clipping, clipping mask clipping layer over top for his little hand here.",
    "So let's do this on a separate layer compared to the rest of his shirt, and let's grab his fur color and let's make a new layer will do a clipping mask layer like we always do.",
    "Hold alt and move the mouse in between and so you see the drop down arrow and then click.",
    "And now we have a clipping mask.",
    "It let's go lower the Opacity so we can see this sketch underneath.",
    "You guys know the drill and then we will color his little hand.",
    "Hey Finch, how are you?",
    "Welcome to the stream.",
    "What is up?",
    "How are you doing?",
    "Are you at work?",
    "It.",
    "Z.",
    "I'm doing good.",
    "We were, uh, the past few days we were like in the middle of a tropical storm tropical storm crystal ball was like coming up through the Gulf Coast.",
    "Uhm, but I'm pretty sure it's pretty much path now.",
    "Our power went out once, but we're doing good now.",
    "It's a slow day so I'm working on some plugins sweet.",
    "Um, I'm doing some little Father's Day artwork.",
    "OK, let's.",
    "Make that layer invisible now and.",
    "Make a new layer and that's going to be underneath.",
    "Tropical's my favorite flavor is.",
    "Taste like fruit punch.",
    "Oh my gosh, the sun is really coming out now, isn't it?",
    "I just looked at my webcam.",
    "Luke has the, UM, shield because he's one of my moderators.",
    "He is the whole monitor of the stream.",
    "He is the rent a cop.",
    "Work for the Bureau.",
    "And everyone has to know.",
    "The Barrow Oh my gosh yes.",
    "I sent the link from my creative cloud account.",
    "Uhm, it's only 1200 by 1200.",
    "I think it's all the layers.",
    "Oh, how many layers do you have?",
    "So since I moved his leg up as farm little actually connect here now.",
    "All monitor, so that means we have to ask bench if we need to go to the bathroom.",
    "Yes, yes, absolutely.",
    "And you also have to ask bench if it's nap time yet.",
    "Hibernation time.",
    "A few for each part.",
    "Excuse me while I tell my husband to stop snickering at that question.",
    "Hey, I work in a lot of layers too.",
    "I mean this is a pretty simple illustration and I have like let's see I have 23.",
    "Usually I like for any like given illustration.",
    "I'll probably have like around at least 50.",
    "Let me open up now, I'm curious.",
    "Let me open up, cast with chats and see or cats having chats.",
    "And let's see how many layers that one has.",
    "That was like a full scene.",
    "I used to work in more layers than I do now, but now that I have, um, more refined process, I come.",
    "Don't need as many layers as I used too.",
    "Let's see I'm seeing.",
    "56 That looks like the highest number.",
    "I'm actually, uh, 5758.",
    "I think 58 is the highest number we got going on here.",
    "Yeah, so like 60.",
    "It's always nap.",
    "Time says bench.",
    "One of the good things about working for the bear oh is that we get to sleep on the job.",
    "I didn't authorize that.",
    "Excuse me, Sir.",
    "Granada says do you name the layers and put them in groups or do you just hit the keyboard?",
    "Uhm, well when I'm streaming I pretty much don't ever name layers.",
    "Um, as you can see.",
    "They're all not labeled, but um, and that's just simply because I'm kind of like Multi Tasking and kind of like distracted like doing multiple things like reading, chat and stuff like that.",
    "So I just like I don't even think about naming layers when I'm working.",
    "I wonder?",
    "Image size and this is a smaller version 16 by 16 inches.",
    "Resolution 72 huh?",
    "I wonder why it's so laggy.",
    "I wonder if it has to do with the art board.",
    "Like there's gotta be a reason your file is so big.",
    "Oh boy.",
    "It's OK, it's OK.",
    "You don't even have that many layers.",
    "The lag is an issue I've had, but I don't know how to not use the Artboard because it seems automatic.",
    "Um?",
    "Oops.",
    "So.",
    "I wonder it won't.",
    "Uh oh, BS won't capture the window because I'm capturing photo shop as a window so you won't be able to see.",
    "But if you go to file file new.",
    "Um and I usually.",
    "Let's see I usually just do a custom one, understand photo, look like normally, do not web mobile.",
    "Like I don't choose any of the preset ones.",
    "1 second, I wonder if I can let me.",
    "Let me just capture my display.",
    "There we go.",
    "Now you guys can see.",
    "My display.",
    "OK.",
    "Actually, for some reason it's not fit to screen 1 second.",
    "There we go.",
    "Um?",
    "So yeah, when I go to file new.",
    "So these are the files that I choose.",
    "I would assume that you probably went to art and illustration and this is the artboard, uhm?",
    "I usually just do a custom one, let's see.",
    "Advanced options that's color color profile.",
    "I don't know.",
    "Oh, maybe it's under photo here.",
    "Default photo shop size.",
    "And then I always do resolution 300 DPI just because that's the resolution that printers work in.",
    "So I always like to have my artwork be just that extra resolution just in case I ever want to print it out.",
    "Pretty much I never work in 72 DPI anymore just to be on the safe side in case I like something enough to print it out as a print.",
    "So I would suggest working in at least 300 DPI.",
    "Or some artists even work in 600 DPI like Sam Peterson.",
    "For instance.",
    "He'll work in 600 DPI and just so he has all of that extra space.",
    "And then when he wants to, like when you want to print something out, you'll just scale it down to 300.",
    "Um?",
    "But let's see.",
    "So.",
    "I don't even it's so funny like I see all of these like like this clipping mask and stuff like I don't even know what that is.",
    "I have such limited knowledge.",
    "About photo shop.",
    "Right after the orientation there is the checkbox for our boards.",
    "Oh, OK.",
    "Yeah, I I don't know.",
    "Like I said, like I don't.",
    "I don't really understand why.",
    "Your file is lagging.",
    "It doesn't really make sense.",
    "OK, so anyway, um?",
    "What I wanted to talk to you about is, uhm, just color relative relativity.",
    "Um?",
    "Might.",
    "Help a little bit.",
    "So.",
    "With your colors that you have.",
    "Like let's say Let's just take this.",
    "What?",
    "Oh weird.",
    "With the colors that you have.",
    "When you when you do this looks like like your colors kind of look a little flat right now, and that's because.",
    "And that's because.",
    "Um, like when you did your shadows and um, your highlights.",
    "Basically, it looks to me I could be wrong.",
    "It looks to me like, uhm, you raise the lightness, but you didn't necessarily change the saturation or Hue shift.",
    "So what we can do here?",
    "Something that's going to make your work look a lot more dynamic, and I think you got this advice from Sam for your tomato to uhm.",
    "Trying to figure out where I should paint.",
    "Let's just make a layer over top.",
    "So even if we just took this green here.",
    "So we can take this green and if you come up here, I usually have my colors in the HSV sliders.",
    "I know most artists don't do that.",
    "I think a lot of artists usually work with the gradient, but personally I feel like I usually have a lot more control over my colors when I can individually change the saturation, the darkness and the Hue instead of just like kind of randomly selecting.",
    "From here.",
    "That's just that's just a personal preference.",
    "You don't have to do that, but.",
    "You'll be able to see, so I'll take this.",
    "Green color will dark in it.",
    "And either desaturated or saturated for the shadows, it's totally up to you.",
    "I usually like to saturate my shadows, but again, that's just a personal preference.",
    "So I'm going to saturate it a bit and I'm also going to Hue shift it so.",
    "So.",
    "Viewing this Um rainbow here is a little deceiving just because it's a line, but in reality the color, the color is a color wheel so these two ends actually connect.",
    "So going to the left, you're going to huge shift it.",
    "Um, a little bit warmer and going to the right you're going to Hue shift it a little bit colder, but if you have shifted to the left a lot then you're going to end up getting back into the cold colors again, because, um again, it's a circle.",
    "Um, so but usually.",
    "Um?",
    "I like I tend to gravitate towards more warm colors, so personally I would probably huge shift this too.",
    "Just a little bit to the red.",
    "Just just a little bit.",
    "A little bit makes a huge difference.",
    "They might actually, maybe not even that much.",
    "Probably don't even need to saturate it or he shifted that much 'cause now it's looking a little Brown.",
    "And I'm going to do the same thing for the highlights.",
    "But opposite, so we're going to make it a little.",
    "We're going to take the.",
    "The kind of midrange color and we're going to lighten it, and we're going to desaturate it a little bit.",
    "And we're probably going to huge shift it just a little bit towards the like orangey orangey warm side.",
    "So relatively speaking, these colors next to each other.",
    "It doesn't really look right.",
    "Just because all of the other things are like those green but green color.",
    "But I think if we were to blend it together.",
    "Don't really have any blending brushes because I don't blend things anymore.",
    "See where is a good blending brush?",
    "Oh, you know what fat son Spongy is what it used to be.",
    "My favorite blending brush.",
    "Where is it?",
    "I think it's in Paintbox.",
    "In the UM, yeah, in piles megapack There is this here it is.",
    "It's the sponge brush that it used to be my all time favorite blending brushes called Fat Fund Spongy.",
    "And Uhm.",
    "Yeah, it's it's got really great texture.",
    "So by Hue shifting even just a little bit, it's going to make your colors look a lot more dynamic.",
    "And a little less flat, hopefully.",
    "Fat month funding.",
    "Now there's a brush I haven't heard of in awhile.",
    "I know, right?",
    "That makes sense because I didn't change the Hue or saturation, I simply relied on color selection and brush.",
    "I really need to remember to utilize them more so when you pick your colors, did you, um, did you color select from this?",
    "Uh, this photo here.",
    "Did you just like color drop?",
    "That's probably why if that is the case, that's probably why originally your lemons looked too bright to you.",
    "Um?",
    "Because it looks like the in the photo, the sunlight is really reflecting off of the lemons alot.",
    "And will actually go back to that.",
    "So originally, um, Jennifer came to me on discord and felt like her lemons were like really too bright and I told her to check her values because it looks like the lemons were kind of like popping out of the image like it didn't look like they belonged in the image because they were so.",
    "Right now it looks a little better.",
    "Even still, I feel like.",
    "So the Dome's are supposed to be the focal point, right, right?",
    "Now?",
    "Because the lemons have this really bright white color on them, they are actually becoming the focal point.",
    "Your eye is more so drawn to the lemons than the Dome's, which is not really what we want, because like I said, the Dome's are the star of the show.",
    "The lemons are just kind of like a garnish.",
    "So really.",
    "These colors should probably be even darker in photography.",
    "Well, honestly, even in this photo, uhm?",
    "I feel like the way that they set it up.",
    "Is is, uhm, taking?",
    "Um, taking attention away from the Dolmas.",
    "I feel like they probably could have set up this food photography a little bit better, like the lemons don't even need to be in the shot fully like this like the like.",
    "The fact that the Dome as an the lemons are taking are both taking up like half the image is kind of a little odd.",
    "Let's see.",
    "Yeah, since you color selected.",
    "Did you color select this blue also from this flew down here in the photo.",
    "It's it's a bit difficult picking pictures because I'm so used to taking photos of my own food.",
    "Oh, you could do that, uhm, I mean.",
    "If you, I mean I don't know if you want to make all of these dishes that you were planning on drawing, uhm, but you could even set up just like a mock up almost.",
    "You don't even need to have the dish necessarily with you, but like you could, you could set up a composition of like a flat, lay a flat layers when you're taking the photo, like from top down.",
    "Um kind of kind of similar to this photo, but you could just like, take objects around your house.",
    "And flat lay them on your table to kind of make up a composition, and so then you can bring that photo into Photoshop and just kind of draw over top of it and use that as like.",
    "A template to draw your composition.",
    "I know some people that like will people that draw like cityscapes and stuff like that.",
    "They literally take like like jars and cups and things like that from their house and though arrange it on their table and then they'll take a photo and they'll bring that photo into Photoshop and they'll draw over top of it.",
    "So then they already have the perspective in 3D space drawn out for them, so they basically just like used.",
    "It used the photo as a 3D template to draw over top.",
    "And you could kind of do the same thing.",
    "Selected the boot blue for my own choice, OK.",
    "'cause I was gonna say if you selected it.",
    "From the kind of looks really similar to uhm.",
    "That blue that's there on the table.",
    "I was going to.",
    "I was going to mention that, uhm.",
    "The table isn't actually blue in this instance, it's just the sunlight because because sunlight has a very blue cool tone to it, sometimes when it's reflecting in through a window.",
    "The.",
    "The color of the table isn't actually blue, it's just the sunlight that's reflecting off of it.",
    "The color of the table is actually more so.",
    "This kind of.",
    "Grayish green color.",
    "I hope this is making sense to you and I hope that I'm helping at all because I know that the way that I explain things is not like I said it's not the most Orthodox way of explaining things, so I hope that whatever I'm saying is at least coming across a little bit.",
    "Hum.",
    "Also, with this white again will go back to, um.",
    "The fact that the lemons are taking up way too much, uhm?",
    "Attention.",
    "Because the because the lemons have this bright white and it's the brightest thing in the image.",
    "That is why that is also why it's taking up a lot of the attention.",
    "Really.",
    "You want to have your darkest darks and your lightest lights on the on.",
    "The one thing in your image that you want attention, so like usually for instance.",
    "When I do.",
    "I'll give, I'll give this one as an example.",
    "Let's turn on the.",
    "Values here.",
    "The brightest thing in the image is the light bulb, UM, which isn't necessarily what I wanted.",
    "Uh, the attention to be most most on, but I also made the brightest area in this image.",
    "The lighting around the characters.",
    "And also the darkest things in the image are the lamp, his jacket, the table, all of these things that are like in the middle of the image where you want the viewers eye to be drawn first.",
    "Like when we.",
    "I don't know if I forget if you were here for this whole thing, but like when I was picking colors for the.",
    "The frames at first I had them as black, but I chose not to do black because I felt like it was drawing too much attention away from the center of the image.",
    "The only the only black in the image that I have is in the center of the image, because that's where I want your eye to be drawn.",
    "Um, these things in the background on the wall like I want you to see them, but I don't want you to see them first.",
    "That's kind of like, so I decided to do to go with UM, one of the Browns from the wall, because it just kind of like falls back in the background and blends in with the wall.",
    "And same with spaces too.",
    "I always have a lot of contrast for my face is I always use this dark black color for eyes because eyes are really important to have attention on because eyes are the windows to the soul.",
    "So, uhm, you want to be able to have a lot of attention on peoples faces?",
    "I could open this one today again, the one that I just did today.",
    "Lots of contrast on the eyes.",
    "I even dark and the black just to make sure that there was contrast on the eyes.",
    "Not that you're drawing characters, but.",
    "Just food for thought for the future.",
    "We could probably even take this yellow.",
    "Let's see where is my paint over layer.",
    "Let's just go in here.",
    "No, that's true.",
    "That's true red.",
    "It takes a lot of self discipline in practice too, um.",
    "To try to retrain your brain to not think of colors very literally.",
    "Uhm, like we all know that the inside of a lemon is pretty much white, right?",
    "But you don't necessarily.",
    "Need to paint it white right?",
    "Uhm because.",
    "The way that lighting works.",
    "Um?",
    "Let's see the way the way that lighting works 9 times outta 10.",
    "It's not going to be white, uhm?",
    "Like for instance, I'll give you a really good example, snow.",
    "Let me look up a picture of a painting of snow snow.",
    "We know that snow is white.",
    "Snow is white, however.",
    "9 times out of 10 when you're painting snow, you're not using white um, like this one.",
    "Very Gray.",
    "This one lots of Blues, lots of yellows, lots of oranges.",
    "Because the light reflects off of the white surface and creates warm and cool shadows.",
    "Warm highlight single shadows.",
    "So it's a matter of practicing color theory for a long time, and I trust me.",
    "I am still learning too.",
    "I can't really draw snow very well, but that's just a good example of.",
    "Um?",
    "How the inside of your lemon doesn't necessarily need to be white like you drew it like it is in the photo.",
    "There we go.",
    "Then I'll draw in the little sesame seeds.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Uh, the sushi is looking awesome.",
    "Just head back over.",
    "Oh thanks thanks I almost just called you Sushi.",
    "Thanks, which uhm yeah I started this uhm a few streams ago and then I stopped working on it to do the Father's Day image.",
    "But this is actually going to be a repeating pattern.",
    "I'm going to want sushi again, but I'm determined to make chili.",
    "I I got sushi uhm, but I think it was like a couple weeks ago.",
    "Um, last stream we were talking about anniversary's because my anniversary is next week and a handful of people in chat were saying that there are wedding anniversary's are this month as well.",
    "But I was just thinking about the fact that CJ and I are going to go do a really fancy steakhouse for our anniversary.",
    "We went to last year.",
    "Also was so good.",
    "Oh my gosh.",
    "OK, I think I might.",
    "Oh, I do need to draw in the little.",
    "Sesame seeds let's do that really quick.",
    "You can come and see if you want it.",
    "I don't know what CJ got me for our anniversary last night.",
    "He He asked me he was like So what do you want?",
    "For your anniversary?",
    "I was like I don't know.",
    "He was like, wait, I know and then he went and ordered it on line.",
    "I have no idea what it is.",
    "Listen to I think tuna usually on so she usually has.",
    "Usually have some lines in it too.",
    "Yeah, it does.",
    "So let's add some lighter pink lines.",
    "Probably going to be thinner.",
    "And see where is the tuna there it is.",
    "I'll just do this on the same layer.",
    "There we go, yeah.",
    "Who?",
    "And let's see.",
    "I guess I'll do.",
    "Through the flavor is I love me some me.",
    "Some tuna is so good.",
    "We are also talking about Pokey balls.",
    "Um?",
    "Wait, I think bring you here for this French.",
    "Weren't weren't you in the you are in the sushi conversation I'm remembering now.",
    "You were here for part of this.",
    "Let's make a clipping mask.",
    "And let's draw some of these.",
    "I used to not be a fan of the salmon, but then it grew on me.",
    "Um, I think because I had only ever really had cooked salmon.",
    "And just like the texture of it was kind of freaky to me.",
    "Um?",
    "But now I love salmon and tuna alot.",
    "What I'm not a fan of his yellowtail.",
    "I've never been able to get into yellowtail.",
    "Like the Yellowtail sashimi.",
    "Especially since I already did the hard part and the sketches already done.",
    "I just need to trace over it.",
    "I love tracing.",
    "Tracing, I always found really therapeutic too.",
    "Tracing is also a big part of how I learn to draw.",
    "A lot of the time, uhm, I learn best by doing like I'm a visual learner also.",
    "But I definitely learn best by just trying something out and I feel like sketching.",
    "I'm sorry um tracing really gave that to me, so I kind of like.",
    "Analyzed.",
    "How I was tracing certain shapes?",
    "And it helps me learn.",
    "That's kind of how I learned perspective too.",
    "No problem, Immanuel.",
    "Thank you so much for stopping by.",
    "Really appreciate you hanging out with us.",
    "I hope you have a good day.",
    "Individual person too sis, Jennifer.",
    "Whenever someone gives me a project I steer them towards sketches or sometimes with some type of mock up.",
    "Yeah exactly.",
    "Do you?",
    "Hey.",
    "I also like to have some kind of direction.",
    "Um, like for instance, if a client comes to me and says, you know, like Hey, can you do some artwork for me?",
    "Um, I always ask them for, you know, kind of like as much detail as they can give me for their idea.",
    "Just because the more detail that I have, the more of an idea that that I have that they want.",
    "So it helps me visualize.",
    "The composition in my head.",
    "You know what I'm thinking guys, I'm thinking that I'd actually don't really like this green.",
    "I feel like it's a little bit too cool color.",
    "It's too cool toned for for my colors and funny enough it's actually.",
    "It's actually my color in my color palette, but again, going back to relative color.",
    "With the other colors that I chose, it looks like really cool, really cool tounge uhm.",
    "So, especially with this Brown background, so I think I'm going to warm up this green a bit.",
    "With saturated more.",
    "Oh yeah, that's much more like what I usually like climbing toned greens rather than cool toned greens.",
    "That's a little bit too far.",
    "I just realized that colored over top of.",
    "The other bowl.",
    "Home.",
    "Of course I did all of these.",
