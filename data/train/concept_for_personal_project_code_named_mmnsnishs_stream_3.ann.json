    "It's been a lot.",
    "It's been quite the learning curve.",
    "There is so much out there on the Internet, but it's hard to digest all of it and really be ready for.",
    "For all of it, you know what I'm saying.",
    "It's it's a little.",
    "It's a little much.",

    "I just.",
    "Totally lost my train of thought.",
    "Anyway, I'm pretty.",
    "Married to the idea of it being like just as wild gnarly mask.",
    "Like all this hair, it's all wrinkly and grows.",
    "Maybe some of these wrinkles can be like swirls.",
    "So these are going to be 3D printed.",
    "We could take advantage.",
    "Of how?",
    "How nice it is to like, hold onto a lot of detail and what not.",

    "The negative of this light and the like.",
    "Let's say her face was here and this is her mouth and her eyes.",
    "So I would just have to hollow it out this way so that this.",
    "Will just slide in here and then.",
    "Now her eyes would actually glow.",
    "And I kind of have that idea for maybe doing some of that, like maybe even.",
    "Like on the sword handle, the sword handle has like lights or the sort itself has lights or even on the clothing.",
    "I don't know, so that's something that I'm considering for later.",
    "But I might be kinda cool if I could if I could pull it off, you know?",
    "But Anyway, I'm uh.",

    "I don't know.",
    "There's like just.",
    "Things like this.",
    "And they're like floating.",
    "So that that might be something that I do for her, but I feel like it's a little too much.",
    "I kind of for me so far.",
    "The idea is that they are more like a.",
    "Just people in clothing, you know?",

    "I might have had like a days left.",
    "Days worth left of like quest to do had gotten almost all the masks already, so I was very close to getting the fierce deity mask.",
    "Yeah it was.",
    "Oh, it was such a shame.",
    "It was such a freaking shame.",
    "Sounds like Nope, never again, never playing this game in my life.",

    "Work on these concepts that you see here since you're just joining.",
    "I hope you don't mind.",
    "I'm going to repeat a little bit of what I was saying earlier.",
    "Uhm, this is, uh?",
    "This is a little project of mine.",
    "That is code name meniscus.",
    "And I will not be revealing what that means for a little while.",
    "It's just something silly.",
    "But this is a personal project of mine.",
    "Uh, if you looked in my Gallery.",
    "If you had a chance to look at it, you'll see something.",
    "No, I only have two or three projects posted, but you'll see one called studies.",

    "And there just my version there.",
    "Just way more.",
    "Detailed than Chevys normally are more dimension to them.",
    "A lot more.",
    "Really, if you will.",
    "So anyway, I got a 3D printer and I wanted to make my studies as.",
    "An actual.",
    "3 dimensional product.",
    "So I started designing.",
    "I started designing my own.",
    "Version of 'em are my own original studies were there.",
    "Just something that I can print out without worrying about.",
    "Like you know, it's fan art, so it's in that Gray area.",
    "You know what I mean?",
    "Instead, this is going to be fully just just me.",
    "You get me.",
    "In My Portfolio, yeah here I might be hands profile.",
    "Um, there's only I think 3 projects that I put up or two and one of 'em is studies.",
    "Yeah, so anyway this is just a this is my own.",
    "These are my original study specifically for this project where I'm going to have them 3D printed for people to paint on their own if they want to.",
    "Going to have little trading cards and like I'm sort of developing a story not not really just.",
    "Very, very rudimentary about the story anyway, but it's just kind of this idea of like a post apocalyptic world.",
    "It's not very original, it'll just hopefully visually be a little bit different than what most people are seeing, but it just post apocalyptic world.",
    "There are a bunch of gangs.",
    "And I guess they're fighting each other, so the first batch that I started doing 'cause I had seen this one sketch.",
    "Um by two cents lists.",
    "Whom if you don't know who that is, he should follow hers does great work.",
    "She streams on here.",
    "I'll see if I can add her.",
    "Social media stuff.",
    "Here in a sack, but she did a sketch in an in my head.",
    "I saw Anohni mask like little only mask.",
    "And all Japanese only mask into and I was like to a quick screen grab of it and then I designed this little.",
    "You know me.",
    "Oh futuristic samurai cyber punk.",
    "That everybody does.",
    "I did just a really quick one and I was like Oh Man, I really like that.",
    "And then I was like kind of want to do one with the Fox mask now.",
    "And as soon as I thought of that also in a tangle, which is this one?",
    "And so this is like a month ago already.",
    "So is it was awhile ago.",
    "I just haven't been able to work on it that much.",
    "I think I did too.",
    "2 lives on this.",
    "Before you could see the playbacks on those.",
    "But that's kind of how it started in the idea, I guess is that there.",
    "Like little gang members and their the whole, the whole stick is that they all wear.",
    "A cultural type mask.",
    "Select the first gang that I'm working on is all Japanese inspired.",
    "The next I'm going to be working on his here, here in a another like 20 minutes or so.",
    "I'm going to be taking a break.",
    "For awhile I'll be coming back later on today.",
    "Uh, to continue working.",
    "I'm going to work on the cat one than echo mask.",
    "Which might eribulin turn has designed.",
    "She did a pretty good job.",
    "But, uh.",
    "And then I think that's the first four that are Japanese, and then the next one is going to be.",
    "Um?",
    "And might be mine.",
    "It might be my in 'cause.",
    "The so far what I have is like um.",
    "But the Japanese, when I was thinking only consumer Tango, Neko and then perhaps a Croat Angle, which is the.",
    "This is a tango but the Crow tangle has like an actual Crow face.",
    "So maybe that one will be the last one.",
    "Not sure, but then I also wanna do like some Egyptian ones.",
    "I really want to do in Anubis one I think you'd be so dope I want to do some Norse ones.",
    "My and Chinese like the Zodiac Minor Nastic.",
    "Might.",
    "I just might melt them a little bit.",
    "But yeah, just it could be pretty fun.",
    "So we'll see.",
    "Heather hoskison hello passer Amoco looking character.",
    "Thank you, Heather, I appreciate that.",
    "But character looks amazing.",
    "Thank you I think.",
    "So since I've already done two other ones, I feel like I'm falling more into like the groove of the actual characters a little bit.",
    "And, uh.",
    "So it just kind of feels, uh.",
    "I feel like here and we're getting in the groove or getting into like the whole field.",
    "The fool universe is starting to kind of flesh itself out, so I'm really.",
    "Really excited with that.",

    "Chest area we're going to call it.",
    "For this session.",
    "And we'll be back in like 4 four hours.",
    "I know that's hard to like why 4 hours?",
    "I just need a little break.",
    "Not even necessary to clean that up right there, but I just really wanted to.",
    "Alright, so.",
    "Think that.",
    "I don't know if I'm going to do those wings that we have up here.",
    "I really don't, but it's still possible.",

    "Wanna hang out?",
    "I just posted a link to my discord on the chat.",
    "Also, in the description of this video, once it comes back up, it does take about an hour for it to be processed, but then you'll be able to view the entire playback and you could even speed up the playback and all that.",
    "Um?",
    "That's my discord.",
