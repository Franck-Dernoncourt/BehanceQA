    "Are we flat and our image?",
    "So I guess I can kind of like do a recap of what we did, so here's the like the flatten layer down here, and if I hide what we just did, so, um.",
    "We started out with.",
    "This well actually now we started out with this sketch, so this is like super rough based on a reference photo that I took of myself and then we kind of threw over it with this sketch.",
    "Um?",
    "I guess I don't have these organized, but we we added color and colored the lines and after we were done with all that, we group those together.",
    "And merge them.",
    "I think I might have like.",
    "Yeah, I liquefied some of this so now we have this all in one layer and we can go back and we're going to do our clean up.",
    "On top of that.",
    "Uhm, but yeah, I think before I like really get into the clean up, I'm going to take a look at some of my edges.",
    "Um?",
    "So like up here in this kind of area we have these little.",
    "Like messy.",
    "Lines are going to.",
    "Get rid of.",
    "I mean.",
    "I mean I am going to go back on top of this and, uh, do some painting like on these shelves, but might as well get rid of this.",
    "Um?",
    "I don't know why it keeps telling me that I don't know what device it's talking about, like the.",
    "The remote is fine.",
    "I know it's not gonna die because I just I just charged it.",
    "I think it's OK.",
    "Um, by our just going to kind of go in and.",
    "Clean this up a tiny bit.",
    "Before we like really get into this.",
    "So we don't need all these like messy lines outside.",
    "Of our character, especially like with the stickers, you kind of want it to be.",
    "Like pretty polished, I would say.",
    "But yeah, this is a.",
    "This is a sticker for my tea tree on printing sticker club for May, so we're waiting on the print to arrive and print that they chose.",
    "Is this one over here in the little preview window?",
    "So I had them vote on which one was their favorite and I am making a companion sticker to go with that one.",
    "So it's like a little matching sticker and.",
    "The Prince will actually be here.",
    "I think one Saturday, so it's pretty exciting.",
    "I started ordering my print sticker club prints from cat print because I started getting a lot more people joining and it's it's easier to, you know, have a printing company print my.",
    "Prince than me printing them at home.",
    "But I do still print my stickers at home.",
    "So I I do have a video on.",
    "YouTube on how I make stickers.",
    "But I will like to talk about.",
    "Some of those.",
    "My different tips that I had on that video, like during the stream, whenever we.",
    "Whenever I like, they kind of come up.",
    "Um, 'cause I?",
    "I use a cricket to cut my stickers and.",
    "I really like it.",
    "It does give me some problems sometimes.",
    "Uhm, I still think like it's magic.",
    "I love watching it cut, but sometimes they don't cut the stickers all the way through and I have to like.",
    "Um?",
    "What kind of help me out a little bit the scissors?",
    "But I think just recently.",
    "Yeah, just recently, the last round of stickers that I cut it, they uhm.",
    "They turned out better because I gotta new Matt.",
    "That's like actually gripping the paper.",
    "The paper that or the map that I was using before I've been using it like.",
    "Probably since.",
    "2018 so it's very old and it kind of like lost the stickiness of it.",
    "Um?",
    "So.",
    "I guess the paper might have been moving around or something.",
    "Uhm, but it has to like set it to a higher.",
    "Like cut pressure and that's been working out actually 'cause it like if you set it high enough then it will go through two passes and it'll cut better.",
    "OK so I went around the edges and I can.",
    "You know, focus on the clean up part now.",
    "Um and I was kind of taking a look at this earlier.",
    "And as far as like like the shells on her Crown like comparing.",
    "This picture to this one I do need to make these shelves bigger I think and have some more coming like back here.",
    "So we're going to draw those in.",
    "On this.",
    "It's.",
    "See also started on the wrong layer.",
    "We're going to start on the new layer, but I started to clean up on last time.",
    "I am going to huge the photo shop window a little bit.",
    "There we go.",
    "Just so I can see a little bit better, um.",
    "Trying to figure out like which brushes I was using before, I think.",
    "I was using the edge control smooth brush an from Jing sketches complete collection and I have those linked in the description.",
    "Coding is wrong color so it's in the live stream.",
    "Description if you want to check out those brushes 'cause it'll be like mostly what I'm using today, um.",
    "So yeah, and I think this brush in particular edge control smooth is really nice.",
    "So when you're painting here.",
    "'cause like it's got one side where?",
    "Try to show you OK so one side is like.",
    "Um, sharper right here and then.",
    "It's smooth.",
    "On the other side.",
    "Then if you go back over it like are used like harder pin pressure, it'll be a hard edge on both sides.",
    "But I think it's really nice for coloring hair.",
    "We're trying to get that same effect that I got last time trying to use the same color palette here.",
    "Make sure we kind of capture her likeness.",
    "Yeah I think uhm?",
    "I think you know mostly like I'm done with her face.",
    "I think there's a few things like stuff up here and maybe some stuff in here that I might need to like.",
    "Go back over and clean up, but for the most part it's like mainly we're going to do.",
    "Her hair I might clean up a little bit like right here on her tail and down here 'cause I feel like the lines might be a little bit too dark in comparison and I guess the big part is her hair and her Crown.",
    "Turn.",
    "But we're gonna to.",
    "And you see, like right here, this little like.",
    "Um piece that I kind of got outside lines probably have to go back.",
    "Um, here in a little bit and just clean up some stuff like that.",
    "Time.",
    "It's OK for right now.",
    "So mainly like for her hair were kind of thinking about these bigger chunks, I guess, um, show you.",
    "See.",
    "And do a different color.",
    "No, there is my color thing on the other window.",
    "Green Monster OK, so her hair and like dividing it mainly into these bigger pieces.",
    "So I'm thinking about like this as it's.",
    "Kind of own piece.",
    "This is its own thing.",
    "We've got this little section coming out of like.",
    "Um top over here.",
    "So it's kind of like how I break up and like think about her, um, just kind of like section it sectioning, sectioning it off.",
    "Because otherwise it gets a little crazy and hard to think about.",
    "Specially like with really long hair.",
    "A man with his clean a player.",
    "You know I've got.",
    "I'm just cleaning up on top of what I already have.",
    "And you see these lines are here like this line, it no longer makes sense.",
    "It wasn't my sketch, but it's.",
    "It's like I've since then like defined where I want her hair to be place.",
    "So I would just kind of like paint on top of that and I can't even go back and.",
    "I'm using my phone.",
    "Come eyedropper tool.",
    "Um, once I have a headset on my remote as a.",
    "One of the buttons I'm using so I have the brush tool selected and if you hold down option it changes it to the eye dropper for you and it's amazing so you don't have to switch your tools so I just have one of the buttons switched to options so whenever I do have my brush selected an I hold that down I can just pick up this color and then let it go and then I continue doing this and just painting her hair different colors that are here like in.",
    "And I also have.",
    "One of the buttons sent to come.",
    "I always forget what it's called, but it's like this little like.",
    "Quiggle button right here, um, so that button if you hold that down whenever you have your brush selected then it will change your brush to an eraser.",
    "As long as you have it held down an it's like.",
    "A brush or it's like an eraser with the same settings as your brush so I could just come back here an erase some of this out just by holding that so I have that key.",
    "On one of my.",
    "Remote buttons.",
    "Which I need to program more of the buttons I just did like those two and then I did um.",
    "Undo and redo.",
    "So there are a lot of buttons that I haven't assigned a.",
    "Roll yet.",
    "And he died.",
    "Figure that out because it's a lot different than uhm, like what I used to have set up.",
    "'cause I did have.",
    "My Wakeham Intuos media, or probable medium and.",
    "It was like, you know you had like your touch ring in the middle and you had like 4 buttons on top or on the bottom I think.",
    "And I'm so used to that like vertical layout, and then I actually got the Centriq 20.",
    "22 HD not too long ago and I kind of had the same button set up on that.",
    "Then I decided to return that and exchange it for.",
    "The 2024 pro um after like doing some more research.",
    "Um?",
    "So yeah, and this tablet doesn't have any buttons on it, it only has.",
    "The touch or the has the express key remote that you can like move around.",
    "So it's like a lot differently as far as layout goes it some.",
    "Very very different, so I'm still trying to.",
    "Figure that out and kind of figure out like what I want.",
    "My workflow to kind of be on that.",
    "My answer is something that takes time and.",
    "Something that I'll just have to play with a little bit more.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Now it would probably be a good idea for me to have.",
    "Hello.",
    "And Navigator window and pulled up.",
    "Uh, it's my other screen right now.",
    "Put it up here so I can kind of see like the the full zoomed out.",
    "Picture.",
    "Can my news?",
    "Nope, not there.",
    "Yeah, I'm gonna skip this over a little bit so I can see it better since it's not full screen.",
    "Um?",
    "Because you know what I just did I don't know if I'm super happy about that.",
    "And if I go back and I take it out and I keep comparing it on the.",
    "The other screen or like them.",
    "The Navigator window up here.",
    "Then I can see like kind of the bigger picture, 'cause I feel like this like taking that dark shape out from behind that part of her hair.",
    "I kinda makes it confusing.",
    "To me at least.",
    "It's not as like a clear shape.",
    "I think really think the best thing for me to do.",
    "Here instead try to quickly block things out, because I feel like her hair right here, it's more like.",
    "Um?",
    "There's like smaller curls instead of the big waves that I have in this one which you know I don't dislike it, but.",
    "I still want to have that same look and.",
    "I think it's because I'm being too, um, precious with my.",
    "Lines right now, so if I just kind of go in here and do more.",
    "No.",
    "Stuff like this room.",
    "I'm looking to build up those shades.",
    "Then I think it'll work out a little bit better.",
    "And if we have a shape like this.",
    "Can I cut it in here and take this out?",
    "It will give her like more of a WAVY hair 5 instead of like like her really long hair having like bigger waves.",
    "I want them to be smaller I think.",
    "I think this is kind of how it went last time I was trying to figure out that shape.",
    "But I wanted for some of the.",
    "My hair so I can break it up a little bit more, but.",
    "Just having a hard time.",
    "Like visualizing it.",
    "It should be easier this time around since I already did it in another illustration.",
    "So like right here, I feel like it's starting to come together.",
    "And now it's not.",
    "They come, I posted a summary, I guess of all my mermaids that I did for mermaid this year.",
    "On Instagram and I asked people like which ones were their favourites.",
    "So people are like voting on the.",
    "The 12 that I posted.",
    "We cannot post on a comment so it's like a lot of people are.",
    "Hum.",
    "Like commenting on that post right now, so I keep getting like a ton of notifications.",
    "But I'm going to be ordering some prints of the mermaids soon.",
    "But I don't really know like how many to order, so you know, asking people OK how like which ones are your favorite ones?",
    "Kind of well help you see like which one is the favourites are not necessarily like saying that those people will all order your prints 'cause that kind of happened to me last year.",
    "I had people vote like which mermaid was their favorite and the one they voted for.",
    "I think only like.",
    "One or two people bought the print and I ordered a bunch of them.",
    "So, um.",
    "And people will vote but not actually like order.",
    "So you have to like.",
    "Um?",
    "Just kind of take.",
    "The results.",
    "As like.",
    "You know a generalization like you don't have to exactly count up all of them.",
    "You can just kind of see like, OK?",
    "Well I'm seeing a lot of this.",
    "I'm seeing a lot of this one.",
    "And I mean sometimes, like your own judgment might end up being better than just taking a poll, but I do like to see, like generally what people think about it.",
    "But it always is very difficult to.",
    "Judge how many of each one you should buy.",
    "Do I still have mermaids from last year that I bought?",
    "I don't know, I might end up like running a sale on Etsy.",
    "To clear some of those out.",
    "What is all a learning process?",
    "So I just started my SC shop like.",
    "Less than a year ago, actually can.",
    "July, I believe.",
    "Oh, it's not quite finished yet.",
    "I have a lot of.",
    "Come here to paint right now.",
    "So I will finish the hair and then will work on her Crown up here and then.",
    "Kind of clean up some like other stuff, but the hair I think will take the longest.",
    "So I'm just kind of like blocking in the colors right now.",
    "But yeah, we worked on this quite awhile.",
    "As far as like digital art goes, it's been like one of those things like.",
    "Alright, I'm always like.",
    "Looking up new things to try.",
    "I give my process.",
    "Like doing.",
    "Some experimenting.",
    "Not like different brushes.",
    "Trying to add more texture or.",
    "Um, like?",
    "Trying a different process may be like.",
    "Um, for example.",
    "Not too long ago I wasn't really using the blending modes as much like you know.",
    "Multiply and overlaying stuff.",
    "I mean, I would use them, but.",
    "I started actually like.",
    "Using them more for like um, overall, like lighting.",
    "Game.",
    "Which is actually something that I used to do it along time ago.",
    "I would like.",
    "Uhm, I mean we're going to do it here in a little bit, but.",
    "I would have.",
    "My.",
    "Like just kind of show you, so we're going to take this away and I'm going to press CTRL click on the little image right here and select the fix tools and make a new layer.",
    "Make it multiply.",
    "And I'm going to just.",
    "Do this, we're going to.",
    "Waiting that up a little bit.",
    "But now, like what I would do?",
    "Would be the erase out.",
    "Highlights So just very, very simply just going here in.",
    "Erase everything.",
    "That would be like.",
    "When?",
    "Yes.",
    "Like obviously this is not like super precise or anything, but.",
    "This is basically how I do it now, um.",
    "Rather than, you know, taking a lot of time to figure out, like every color in their first and try to like workout shadows and stuff.",
    "I like basically do this.",
    "But like a lot cleaner.",
    "And then I'll paint over it again.",
    "To come.",
    "Can you help me?",
    "Um?",
    "Like integrate the blending mode better with the painting.",
    "I mean, sometimes I don't really have to do a whole lot too.",
    "From like.",
    "Naked.",
    "Kind of like, more cohesive but.",
    "I just like to go back and.",
    "Paint on it a little more.",
    "Kind of like what I'm doing now, but.",
    "He'll be a multiplier multiplier layer, or like an overlay layer or something in between.",
    "And that painting layer and.",
    "The.",
    "Hum.",
    "The painting layer and like rendering like clean up later.",
    "Hold on 1 second.",
    "My dad is asking me what this coffee was that he had at my house.",
    "Uhm, I had like 1 sample cake up.",
    "Ann And I was like I don't want it, I don't.",
    "I don't know I, I'm very particular about my coffee.",
    "I like it.",
    "Um, pretty sweet.",
    "So that was like a.",
    "I think a medium or a dark roast coffee and I like light roast.",
    "So here is over at my house and he's like I'm really tired.",
    "Can I have some coffee?",
    "And let's make sure, do you want this?",
    "I'm not going to drink it and he's like sure and he's like, wow, that's really good so.",
    "Is your asking me what kind it was?",
    "Yeah, it really does like speed up your shading process.",
    "I got time.",
    "One of my favorite pieces like recently, that idea stood on.",
    "It was an Animal Crossing drawing that I did.",
    "Oh, I spent on their own coffee.",
    "Close.",
    "Pikes place and I said bye to peak which is like I think in Colorado Uhm?",
    "Uh, what was I talking about?",
    "So I want to show you.",
    "Um, one of the ways that I used this.",
    "Technique.",
    "Where is it out?",
    "Come from the right file.",
    "So here is what it looks like.",
    "Um?",
    "Before the.",
    "That was a fight, but.",
    "I guess I can show you so.",
    "Um?",
    "Here's a little video I did, so this was like before I added any of the multiply stuff and then I started like.",
    "Erasing stuff out and like completely toned it.",
    "So it was like it added a nice like rainy effect like a kind of a Missy Gloomy day.",
    "So it was like these are the colors before and then after like it night and day different.",
    "I just kind of like.",
    "That way, rather than.",
    "Trying to workout all the colours beforehand 'cause it makes the process so much faster.",
    "But anyways, yeah, we will do that here in a little bit after I get done holding here.",
    "I have only used illustrator one time and I found it very difficult.",
    "I guess 'cause it maybe I was used to using photo shop.",
    "But I had to use it for a class.",
    "Um in college, which is like the only like as a digital art class.",
    "But it was like, not really.",
    "Digital art like we had to make a.",
    "Like a link black and white vector image of.",
    "It's like I think it had to be a self portrait or something.",
    "So it wasn't like we weren't drawing.",
    "And then, like another assignment we did for that class was like.",
    "Edit the code of the.",
    "The image to make it like glitch out and that was like.",
    "The whole thing that's all you're supposed to do, and it's like, no, I want I just want to draw.",
    "Going to illustrate stuff like in photo shop.",
    "But I've been using photo shop for a very long time.",
    "Started with Photoshop elements in 2007 and it was like elements.",
    "Five, I believe.",
    "Then I got elements four or four.",
    "I wouldn't go backwards.",
    "Element.",
    "8.",
    "Um?",
    "And then I upgraded to.",
    "I think it was.",
    "CS6 after that.",
    "Or maybe it was CS four.",
    "Don't remember.",
    "And now I'm using Photoshop CC.",
    "Oh yeah, I I do also use procreate on the iPad and do not think I've used.",
    "Press the wrong button.",
    "Uhm, I this paint but.",
    "I believe that on the tablet that I just did a review on on them.",
    "Like on YouTube, it's the Picasso tab.",
    "I believe that that software comes on that tablet, but whenever I did my like review of it like I tested out.",
    "Autodesk sketchbook.",
    "So I just tried out the one thing.",
    "Further, if you but I think like I watched some other peoples reviews of the tablet as well.",
    "And they were saying that they used to that software.",
    "Fine.",
    "I mostly like use procreate to do like sketches and stuff if I'm.",
    "You know, if I want to.",
    "Like sit in bed and draw.",
    "I sit on the couch which I don't recommend like.",
    "Click OK.",
    "I think I've had enough.",
    "Painting for now, honey to switch that, but.",
    "So much I can't ignore it.",
    "It's one of the only things I have left to do on this.",
    "Thank you, I have not saved and oil.",
    "About flipper canvas.",
    "To kind of get like a fresh perspective on this.",
    "I'm actually thinking maybe her hair right here needs to have more of A.",
    "Hello.",
    "This shape I think after you know, flipping the canvas, getting a new perspective on it.",
    "This would help balance.",
    "Things out a little bit more.",
    "So I guess there's a nicer silhouette.",
    "It's always important to remember to flip your canvas because.",
    "You know, looking back on like my older drawings where I didn't put my canvas, if you like.",
    "Go back and you flip it.",
    "You can see like things are like shifting to one side or the other, or you like whenever you do flip it.",
    "You can kind of like.",
    "You can see balance.",
    "Better like how to balance something out and just be like if something is lopsided.",
    "So.",
    "Some very uhm.",
    "Very good thing to do often.",
    "Especially like in the drawing part of this, like I'm painting right now, but if I were doing more drawing, I'd be flipping this more often, I think.",
    "Because it's it's good to have.",
    "A good drawing set up for a foundation.",
    "For your paintings.",
    "I know whenever I was in college like we would have to take.",
    "Like I don't know for sure if painting was a requirement, but I know like.",
    "Drawing was a requirement for everybody, even like people who weren't going to end up.",
    "Thanks, drawing has.",
    "Hum.",
    "Click their main focus.",
    "So you know, even the painters would have to draw, and some people were like, why do I have to learn how to draw when I'm going to paint?",
    "And.",
    "I mean.",
    "Like I just said, I'm guessing drawing is an essential like foundation.",
    "Even if you're going to mostly focus on painting.",
    "Like a good setup.",
    "Hum.",
    "For your painting.",
    "Haven't done any like.",
    "Actual like oil painting and so long.",
    "I think the last time I did that might've been college, or might have done a painting for a gift for somebody but.",
    "Sometimes it's nice to switch up here.",
    "Medium might give usually work digitally, like maybe if you feel like your art is getting stale or something when you switch up.",
    "You working what you're working in.",
    "So sometimes I like randomly feel like doing watercolor even though I'm not very good at watercolor.",
    "Uhm?",
    "Just OK at it.",
    "So yeah, if I get too impatient.",
    "I just AM.",
    "All rush ahead too far into the process without taking my time and.",
    "I usually end up.",
    "You know?",
    "Making a mess of things.",
    "His watercolor makes it very easy to do that.",
    "For the last watercolor painting I did was.",
    "It had like 4.",
    "Little plant painting and I put them in my dining room which is now my husband's office.",
    "He's like working at home so.",
    "If you're still annoying.",
    "I want to make another one for our guest room is it's like.",
    "I guess it's like gum.",
    "Hello.",
    "Kind of like well like out West themed like Utah and stuff.",
    "Um, I do have like A.",
    "They shoul painting.",
    "Hi.",
    "I think warlock.",
    "But I met him at Lightbox.",
    "And I bought that painting or it's a painting of the Neros",
    "In Utah, so it's like the.",
    "It's in Scion National Park like a.",
    "A trail that goes through a Canyon, let's filled with water.",
    "So you're like, sometimes it goes up to like.",
    "Above your waist when you're walking through there, it's pretty wild.",
    "But we, uh, I went on a trip.",
    "2 summers ago.",
    "I guess, and it was me and.",
    "My husband my.",
    "Brother and my sister in law.",
    "So we took a road trip.",
    "Over there.",
    "Hum.",
    "We like flew from Louisville to.",
    "Denver and rented a car and then we drove to uhm.",
    "Well, we did stay in Colorado for a little bit throughout the 1st place we stayed.",
    "He, like it, was a Hot Springs like in.",
    "Ask it was quite Colorados Springs, but.",
    "Not sure uhm?",
    "But it was beautiful.",
    "Over there.",
    "And then we went to.",
    "Utah after Colorado.",
    "I think we might have spelling two days or something called Colorado 1st and I want it to Utah.",
    "Um?",
    "Went to like artist National Park.",
    "But you know the first part of the trip.",
    "I don't know if it was like day one or day two.",
    "We made the mistake of going to maroon bells in like Aspen, Colorado when the buses weren't running.",
    "Uhm, so we did a 12 mile hike like they're back like walking up.",
    "It's just like a road, but the buses aren't running since it was like snowy at the top.",
    "And this was like.",
    "In May 2 years ago, so um.",
    "You know, like we've got up on the.",
    "But like we walked all the way up there to see maroon bells and it was like getting dark.",
    "I'm pretty sure we hear DeMuth and really trying to get back to the car as fast as we could.",
    "We don't want them move to attack, but I mean it's really pretty up there.",
    "I just wish I had a little bit more time to enjoy it.",
    "So next time I go.",
    "Definitely be going in like June or something because.",
    "Definitely won't be taking that bus.",
    "'cause like the rest of the trip, like my legs are dead and it was like a hiking trip.",
    "So.",
    "Big mistake.",
    "And I mean, I personally think the walk up there was the worst, but everybody else like to walk down was like awful.",
    "Because it's like our lights are already tired and then we're walking down like a sloped road.",
    "So every step it was just like you could feel the pain from like walking up.",
    "I mean, yeah, both were pretty bad.",
    "But doing arches National Park the next day.",
    "Like that was very difficult because of the.",
    "The hike up to maroon bells.",
    "Um?",
    "You know?",
    "I think it still would have been a little bit difficult anyways, because when you go up to um.",
    "Or like when you're in arch is and you're making the hike to it's called delicate arch.",
    "It's like a very famous like rock formation arch.",
    "Well, oh, I guess I didn't show you guys.",
    "This is actually Arches National Park.",
    "This is the picture that I took.",
    "Like before we drove back to the hiking trail to see.",
    "The delicate arch, and when you're walking up there, it's like a very very steep.",
    "Like pretty much is giant rocks lab and they're like multiple levels of them.",
    "And I would walk a seriously like.",
    "10 steps.",
    "Wait, I gotta stop because my legs are hurting so bad it was.",
    "It's embarrassing.",
    "Oh But it's worth the.",
    "So off over there.",
    "But those are like my favorite kind of trips is like I love.",
    "Just like being in nature and seeing different.",
    "Landscapes that I don't normally see because like over here.",
    "Like in Kentucky, it's like.",
    "Basically green and trees.",
    "Um, for the most part.",
    "So I love seeing environments like.",
    "Like this I love like.",
    "The purple tones, like in the shadows.",
    "Um, just like really inspiring to me, it's all those colors are beautiful.",
    "Some jealous of you guys who lives like.",
    "No western part of the United States.",
    "To see all that over mountains.",
    "Beautiful.",
    "I really wanted to go back this year.",
    "But you know?",
    "Coronavirus said Don't think so?",
    "We're not this year.",
    "I was really excited for light box too and that got cancelled so.",
    "Some time to go back to California as well.",
    "It's OK.",
    "Yeah, I kind of flipped the canvas and I forgot to work on her her that I was actually supposed to be working on.",
    "I'll go back and will take a look at the colours that.",
    "Uhm, you know I kind of.",
    "Added on this one I know I used a few like different.",
    "Kind of blending modes on top.",
    "Of the hair layer.",
    "But I think I might try to pull some of those colors back in before we move on to.",
    "And anything else.",
    "Since we pretty much have this.",
    "White down like I want it to be.",
    "OK, so we're going to put our canvasback.",
    "And also going to rotate it but sitting back up right?",
    "It was kind of like this is what we do.",
    "And so I'm saying, like, right here I like this contrast.",
    "Between the line color and I'm not really getting that here, so I think maybe.",
    "It needs a little help, um, as far as just like.",
    "This part of the hair and like down here I don't want to like add it on.",
    "To everything just kind of like.",
    "The main chunks of here to like separate it out a little bit.",
    "I think that might be OK, but I can hear do a little bit of cleanup.",
    "OK.",
    "We're also going to have to go back and clean this part up around the edges.",
    "My sharpen things up a little bit.",
    "We want to look good for when it's printed as a sticker.",
    "OK.",
    "So what we're going to do now is going to make cards knew clean a player.",
    "And I'm going to take a look at some of these, like color tones that I have.",
    "In the original 1.",
    "So here like you can see like in the deepest, darkest parts of her right here.",
    "There this kind of like a.",
    "Purplish color.",
    "Gonna look at like adding some of that back into here.",
    "Kind of coloring on top of what I already have.",
    "Um?",
    "And you know, by doing that it will help me add some more depth.",
    "Too late, already have and let's see.",
    "Going to reduce.",
    "Reduce to have to be a little bit more and I'm gonna use just a basic chalk rush that.",
    "I believe.",
    "I may have edited, you know, talked about this many times on the stream by it, uhm?",
    "I don't remember if I edited this pressure and I feel like I did like slightly, but it's.",
    "It was a.",
    "Original Photoshop brush.",
    "At one point.",
    "But we also want to think about.",
    "Kind of the way.",
    "The hair is moving like think about it like a ribbon so you see.",
    "So say this now.",
    "Up She.",
    "Let's do this so.",
    "This is like a strand of hair.",
    "Like this?",
    "And so you want to have like.",
    "You want to pay attention to like the highest point of your like curves, so like this would be like a gradient.",
    "This would be going down into like a gradient.",
    "Like it's like a ribbon, so um.",
    "Honey.",
    "Got a little bit more and then you'd have the highest point.",
    "You know the.",
    "Up here With.",
    "OK.",
    "Brighter highlight like in the middle kinda thing.",
    "So if you think about it that way, it makes things a lot easier.",
    "Is like when you're coloring here.",
    "But we're just going to kind of keep on going on with what we have.",
    "I don't like this 100% anymore.",
    "And another reason I wanted to make a new layer is because you know in the in this layer down here the one below it.",
    "I kind of blocked in these shells and I don't want to like.",
    "Yes, lose my progress on that.",
    "Um, so I'll be able to erase out like.",
    "The parts for the shells are, but I'm just going to kind of paint on top of them for now.",
    "To finish like this part of her hair.",
    "It's like underneath the Crown.",
    "Which is it's not a lot so.",
    "Not.",
    "Too much we have to worry about this is when I think about so her part is in the middle.",
    "So here's like going into the heart like that.",
    "And we can just zoom back in here and.",
    "Kind of erase out some of this.",
    "I'm going to increase the opacity this up.",
    "There we go.",
    "Just kind of a raise the.",
    "Right now account.",
    "But I will make a new layer.",
    "For our shells, here in a minute.",
    "When I start focusing on the Crown again.",
    "Let's see, I'm going to pick up some of the brightest highlights.",
    "We have them here, so here's this kind of Green.",
    "And I'm going to just kind of put it on the top of like the ribbons.",
    "Making Papa love it more.",
    "I think that I have failed the opacity little bit high for this.",
    "So I still want it to blend.",
    "In here.",
    "Uh, my card compare.",
    "So I think that.",
    "Gives us some better.",
    "By contrast, we can check our value check layer.",
    "Uh, which is a It's a layer that's filled with white and then the blending mode is set to color so we can just kind of check like our contrast and see if our values are varied enough so I can see like from what I added I added some more contrast in here.",
    "After her.",
    "So I think it's kind of going in the right direction.",
    "I could even like.",
    "Dial it back a tiny bit.",
    "So it might be a little bit too much.",
    "And then on the highest highlights I will.",
    "But tiny bit.",
    "A wider big green color.",
    "So yeah, that's pretty much like what we're gonna have for the hair now.",
    "And.",
    "We can focus on a juicy.",
    "I need to have some more highlights here like in her face.",
    "So we're going to see you.",
    "What is the brightest?",
    "Tone that I added here.",
    "Original one, so I'm gonna lower this opacity a little bit and we're going to try to.",
    "See how this works.",
    "And sometimes it's like.",
    "Interesting to work in black and white.",
    "Um?",
    "So you can really take a look at your values and like what it's doing.",
    "To your drawing.",
    "Hum.",
    "So I don't know if this is.",
    "Really, the direction I want to go with this doesn't mean her chins like 2, right?",
    "But I'm not really sure about that color, cool.",
    "Speak with two yellow.",
    "'cause I hardly go.",
    "Please let me undo this.",
    "OK.",
    "I'm gonna go ahead and I'm going to make a new layer and we're going to focus on the Crown now, so I'm going to really just like.",
    "Zoom in so I can see the different textures I used originally.",
    "Um and I know that I am a little fly in my room.",
    "Originally I.",
    "Made like one of these shells and then I copy and pasted because it made things a lot faster and easier.",
    "So I think we're going to do the same thing.",
    "Here, uhm.",
    "There is this other one ad.",
    "So instead of like just painting on top of that and.",
    "Actually going to.",
    "Just work on a brand new one over here thinking about.",
    "This shape.",
    "More.",
    "It's like one of those like spiral shells.",
    "I'm glad already have like the colors and stuff worked out, so it makes things a lot easier.",
    "Hum.",
    "You guys are so quiet today.",
    "Further, really did too much.",
    "So it's again stars.",
    "I might do this again, actually.",
    "Don't have a teeny tiny ones coming out from the side or something?",
    "OK.",
    "Uh, so I think.",
    "Honestly, I might just go ahead and.",
    "Plot this one on top of.",
    "The other shell that I.",
    "Hum already true.",
    "Because I think it needs to be angled.",
    "Little bit more.",
    "Kind of like that.",
    "Maybe I need to make the the middle shell bigger butt.",
    "To do that in a minute.",
    "We're just trying to get the placement of these and I will color underneath with them.",
    "Consistent, might clean up stuff.",
    "OK, so I think that's better.",
    "Definitely.",
    "Certain put look like the same Crown, uhm?",
    "But to be honest, some of them could be.",
    "OK meet shrunk down little bit.",
    "Here.",
    "Try and keep them like organize as far as like.",
    "You know which layers, on top of which one?",
    "So yeah, when I merge them together like this.",
    "They are.",
    "Where they should be?",
    "So that leaves on one side.",
    "He's on the other side.",
    "And I think some of them need to be dumb.",
    "Translate modified a little bit ago.",
    "Can't find them.",
    "So I'm just kind of like.",
    "Shrink some of them so they're different sizes.",
    "Before I start adding spots.",
    "So do you want to have that nice like arching shape?",
    "That I have over here in the original.",
    "I see so.",
    "Who is afraid?",
    "It's going to be too loud.",
    "When I said tell my water bottle.",
    "All right, uhm?",
    "I had some stuff.",
    "OK um.",
    "So no, before I do that, I'm going to get a.",
    "Let's try this pencil brush.",
    "I had some like texture is this.",
    "Yes, I love it.",
    "It's working out.",
    "There's so many brushes in this like brush collection that it's hard to like.",
    "Remember what all of them do I gotta test them all out, but like you know I have my favourites that I use all the time and then the other ones just kind of like.",
    "Compared to be like me, well just try this one, see how it goes like.",
    "Perfectly for what I was trying to do.",
    "So I just want to add some like texture on these.",
    "To make them?",
    "How about like spiral?",
    "Shape.",
    "Have emphasized the volume is a little bit.",
    "And now we can add our spots.",
    "Actually going to merge these two layers.",
    "Um, we're going to pick up this color.",
    "From this spot.",
    "Something.",
    "I usually was doing about five on each one.",
    "You don't have to be.",
    "You know.",
    "Even on all of them, but.",
    "OK.",
    "And now I think going back.",
    "See you later.",
    "I wanna be on.",
    "So this.",
    "OK, there's nothing on this layer, so we're going to do is kind of go back underneath.",
    "These shells that we just ruin and add back in parts of the hair.",
    "And I think I'm going to go back to my sketch square brush just because that's like what I did the lines with and I feel like it just works well as like a general.",
    "Fresh have like a good amount of control over my lines and everything.",
    "Send anything thinking.",
    "I clean up like this.",
    "But we're only going to do this part of the hair right now.",
    "Because we're going to go back on top and do you know the same kind of thing that we did with these shells with the ones in the foreground on the Crown?",
    "So are we might as well do this first and then go back and add those on top and then do kind of the same thing.",
    "'cause like right here in this little section I'm going to have to go back and erase.",
    "Yeah, 'cause a lot of the like initial sketch part is still there.",
    "It's even like on the outside.",
    "So we have to just clean that up tiny bed.",
    "And like this all whole section right here will be covered up by a different shell, so there's no point in wasting our time.",
    "To cover that up.",
    "So this layer them coloring on is.",
    "On a higher layer than this little shell in the middle.",
    "So it will probably just go back on top of that here in a minute.",
    "Um, so it's pretty much.",
    "Pretty much better friends that, uhm?",
    "Might go back and.",
    "Wanna have a few little highlight lines?",
    "Here.",
    "Alright, so now we can go back and we can erase.",
    "Some messy.",
    "There we go.",
    "Goodbye.",
    "We're still some back there.",
    "But Watt easier now since is that stuff is on another layer.",
    "No, don't worry about it anymore.",
    "Not that that is on the same layer.",
    "This one I can go.",
    "Right, I think that's really all that we can do for right now.",
    "And we'll do our shelves.",
    "On top of these.",
    "After I think I'm going to make this a little bit bigger.",
    "Can't wait to print these out.",
    "Get 'em all cut out and everything.",
    "She said, like exciting, to be able to like hold your heart in your hands like when you're so used to doing digital and like actually printed out and everything.",
    "It's just like Oh wow this is like a thing I can hold it.",
    "Thanks stickers or something.",
    "My favorite thing so.",
    "To make.",
    "Although I've always been like very particular about stickers like on the kind of person who doesn't really stick my stickers on things, I I use them is kind of like.",
    "Almost little Prince like I have.",
    "I don't know if you guys can see.",
    "In in the background, I have like a bunch of Art.",
    "Uhm, most of it's like art that I bought from people at light box on Etsy and stuff.",
    "Or just other artists like online shops?",
    "Some of it's mine, just like extra stuff that I had.",
    "What I was thinking friends or something?",
    "Um, but like.",
    "All the stickers I have up there are, uhm.",
    "Just like not stuck to anything there just kind of.",
    ", Chillin up there and.",
    "They only stickers like I have on my sketchbook are just like extra stickers of mine 'cause I don't want anybody else is stickers to like get ruined.",
    "Just put my extra so my sketchbook.",
    "Like I don't know if that looks like they know or anything, but.",
    "Yeah, I just like.",
    "I don't want to commit to putting somebody elses sticker on like you know, like my sketchbook.",
    "I'm not going to use it forever.",
    "I'd rather like display their stickers like on my wall back there.",
    "And like that's where I record my YouTube videos too, so.",
    "Sounds like my background.",
    "Whenever I ask and see them.",
    "All right?",
    "So what I'm going to do with these other shells is I'm going to sketch the shape like a basic shapes of them out, and then I'm going to just paint on top and kind of like carve out.",
    "The negative space I guess.",
    "And I think that'll help.",
    "Um?",
    "Kind of like layout the shaves verse.",
    "Rather than getting into the details and the like, aren't don't like what this looks like.",
    "So just going to try to draw on top of these first.",
    "Now.",
    "Another shell over here.",
    "These are kind of like the ones that look like fans almost.",
    "So.",
    "And I guess you couldn't really see this other like sand dollar, but I'll have it Pekin.",
    "From there is another one.",
    "Another shell peeking on this side.",
    "Can I go in around?",
    "One side of her head.",
    "And rather than like treating those as a lines, I'm just going to paint on top of everything.",
    "I'm kind of say in these lines, but it's really not a big deal if I.",
    "Out of them, so I want to have like.",
    "Kind of a pain to you.",
    "Look to it.",
    "So we're not.",
    "We're not super worried about that.",
    "I'm also going to use the.",
    "I don't like gold sparkle things like I'm going to put those on top.",
    "So that will happen after TV shows.",
    "OK, so on this leg little shell like the the lighter parts are.",
    "Supposed to be like the highlight, so there.",
    "Some kind of like?",
    "The highest point in the more it's got, the shadows were going to cut in a little bit to form the shape of the shell.",
    "So it's more of an interesting shape.",
    "Can I erase this little spot that I can color?",
    "Ugly is barking.",
    "You like Barks at everything.",
    "I don't know how to like help him understand.",
    "That's not something that we do.",
    "He still like.",
    "He turns nine months old on.",
    "Yes.",
    "Friday so.",
    "Hum.",
    "I mean, I want to catch it while he's young and like try to help him understand like you can't just park it like random stuff.",
    "Doesn't make sense.",
    "My other dog Marley.",
    "He's coming.",
    "He's 11, but he's always been quiet and.",
    "Never had a problem with barking or anything.",
    "I think Oakley is very strong willed and he thinks he's a big boy.",
    "When he is only like.",
    "14 pounds.",
    "Kind of tempted to like pick up this shell in the move.",
    "It probably should.",
    "I'm gonna do it.",
    "So I'm gonna be perfect, but.",
    "Sneak this on over here.",
    "We can kind of modify it from there.",
    "Just paint on top of it.",
    "Watt easier than having to redo every single thing.",
    "Thank work harder or work smarter, not harder.",
    "That's it.",
    "Like if I have the ability to do this, I wouldn't.",
    "Why wouldn't I do it?",
    "Just making things more difficult on myself?",
    "I have a feeling we won't be getting to the Animal Crossing um stickers today.",
    "So maybe I'll do those like next week or something.",
    "I am going to be recording.",
    "I'm going to be recording a couple videos this week.",
    "For YouTube.",
    "Um?",
    "So I'm doing a critiquing my old Animal Crossing Art Video.",
    "Some kind of silly.",
    "And I'm doing a video about like my art journey and kind of like talking about school.",
    "And stuff 'cause I think that might help.",
    "In awesome, are you guys here maybe in high school who are thinking about going to art school or people who are in college and.",
    "You know trying to figure everything out.",
    "I think that would probably be helpful for you guys.",
    "Hopefully.",
    "Like kind of how I approach like most of my videos that I make like.",
    "Hum.",
    "I guess like it, is it something that I would want to know like?",
    "Or I would have wanted to know like when I was like first starting out.",
    "So.",
    "So it's a very confused when it came to school, because you know Art School of expensive.",
    "So it's like do I need to do this like How do I make most of what I have?",
    "So you will see me kind of saying.",
    "Uhm, so yeah, I'll be working on that script tomorrow and then be recording it like the next couple days.",
    "One of the videos will be out.",
    "Probably, let's say we probably have a new video come out next week and then.",
    "One may be the last week of June.",
    "I don't know, maybe I'll save one for July.",
    "I'm taking come July off from Patrion Because.",
    "Actually, teaching a class for 21 draws.",
    "Kickstarter so I have like the information on that on my Instagram.",
    "If you'd be interested in taking a class made by me.",
    "So, uh, that's about like digital painting in procreate.",
    "And then.",
    "Yeah, I just want to like make sure that I have all my time to like focus on that video.",
    "So if I'm taking off in July and then also if I have time, I'll take vacation.",
    "Like just vacation time not doing anything.",
    "So probably, either, like probably really one of the videos in June and the one in July.",
    "The Dark Yes OK?",
    "And pressures stopped working for sale.",
    "Saying words like somehow the issue with.",
    "The shape that I made this.",
    "Maybe that helps a little bit.",
    "Maybe I put it.",
    "For down here.",
    "Who?",
    "Once we add some shadow back there, like underneath her arm.",
    "It might not look as weird.",
    "I'm just gonna like hide that I'm going to make a new layer and then.",
    "I'm going to.",
    "Sounds like.",
    "Add design like this.",
    "So I can stay with the same shade and then I'm going to reveal that layer again.",
    "So we can just have use it as our guide.",
    "'cause I wanted this kind of thing right here to resemble resolving Jenner crowned.",
    "So I'd like will highlight in here.",
    "So sparkly.",
    "And yeah, and.",
    "Now go ahead and flip this.",
    "Again.",
    "Full answers highlight here.",
    "Trying to find the form a little bit better.",
    "Hum.",
    "And we will.",
    "To handle like I need to look at my reference that I have, um.",
    "On my phone.",
    "How did it go?",
    "So I have like my hand pose but I need to make sure I pay attention to the way.",
    "Um, the different planes are facing and like the different angles, it's like really important when you're drawing hands.",
    "Um?",
    "So like I don't think I'm the best.",
    "The drawing hands, but I've been getting better lately because I've been paying closer attention to my reference.",
    "And I just taking it as like.",
    "Hello like focusing more on the shapes.",
    "Rather than like Oh my gosh, the finger goes here and then slight complicated looking at.",
    "Looks weird.",
    "This is a better way to approach.",
    "Drawing hands is just walking them out like little mittens first.",
    "And then going back, and you know.",
    "Kind of color in them.",
    "In like blocking them in like this.",
    "So it's just very simple, uhm?",
    "I mean, I might even like go ahead and move this around here in a second after I merge my layers before we start our sticker.",
    "Some outline and stuff.",
    "So my reference and like holding on to my armor and I didn't really have.",
    "I didn't really draw her hands like that here.",
    "Close.",
    "But it looks like.",
    "That's right.",
    "Walk the rest of it then.",
    "Ha yeah, right now.",
    "It's like incredibly like angular.",
    "And I think I pulled this out too much.",
    "We install.",
    "Trial and error just to see like what looks the best.",
    "Anything else I need to do before I start working on that hand pumping so?",
    "Uh, so group.",
    "This way all these layers right here together and I'll duplicate them and merge them.",
    "So now I can.",
    "Go back here and I can liquefy this.",
    "Um?",
    "Oh my gosh.",
    "My brother just sent me a text saying, uh, there's this movie that we watched on Netflix the other day, uhm?",
    "Who is Sierra?",
    "Burgess is a loser.",
    "So we thought would be good.",
    "I didn't really like it.",
    "Very much.",
    "And he's like it's so good, and um.",
    "Yeah, I mean my husband watched it were like.",
    "First, Disappointingly, How would be better?",
    "Yeah, he's my husband was just like it.",
    "So bad no.",
    "Bye.",
    "Put all those.",
    "Texts are gonna be about I guess.",
    "OK.",
    "Hello.",
    "Kind of looking.",
    "Pelican bad my God.",
    "Up It looks so weird.",
    "It looks like a dump truck claw or something very bad.",
    "Cortana.",
    "Pretend that.",
    "Not there.",
    "But what I did isn't working.",
    "I draw on top of it real quick to see if we can make it better.",
    "I don't.",
    "Yeah, I don't quite get the angle.",
    "Very quick, right?",
    "And do I make a reference, uh?",
    "Wait, oh, did I make the this one right here?",
    "Yeah, I did that one a few weeks ago on a stream.",
    "And I'm making the.",
    "Like a sticker to like.",
    "Go along with it.",
    "Because this was the mermaid that everybody on patrion voted.",
    "4.",
    "As their favorite one, so I have a print sticker club on there where.",
    "You know I make a new print Anna sticker every month that.",
    "An exclusive to Patris on And, uh.",
    "They like sign up and we uhm like I'll make it later on like.",
    "In that month, and I'll be like a surprise kind of thing, but this one is for May.",
    "So I mean the matching sticker.",
    "Go along with it.",
    "From this month theme is June theme.",
    "Is called.",
    "Citrus Grove, so it's going to have something to do with oranges or lemons or something.",
    "I already know what it's going to be, but it's ecrit so to watch out on Instagram to see when that is posted or it will be posted.",
    "Earlier on Patris on.",
    "Hum, but normally what I do is I will make up the print in the sticker and then like reveal it after they get it.",
    "But since they already knew, like.",
    "What the print laws since that last month was a little bit different.",
    "I went ahead and I thought, you know.",
    "I can just draw this during the screen.",
    "Uhm, but honestly I might work on the.",
    "The print.",
    "For June, during the stream later this month too, will have to see I'll have to.",
    "Talk to them and see you like what they think about that.",
    "So now everybody like from Patreon comes over here and watch is the stream.",
    "So maybe I could be like hey spoilers for.",
    "Patrons who wants their sticker.",
    "It'll be a surprise or the front door sticker to be a surprise.",
    "Sorry guys, I just like uhm.",
    "Play drop my phone.",
    "Email and I was just like.",
    "In vibrated on the table and.",
    "Sounds write-off.",
    "Don't make it.",
    "Sing Make a much better.",
    "See I struggle with hands to you know a lot of people do.",
    "They're just weird things.",
    "Great things to draw.",
    "Steven looks better than it did.",
    "Maybe for you, look at it and I don't think those.",
    "Bad necessarily up.",
    "Yes, we need to be able to see her other hand, curling down rather than going straight out too.",
    "Find Elvis.",
    "This kind of a deal with that.",
    "Might be getting uncomfortable in my chair.",
    "I'm sitting so long.",
    "Alright, I think this is fine.",
    "Far as a hand goes full wonky.",
    "Once I stop looking at it for awhile, maybe it will look better.",
    "I'm going to make the color of this as like following me.",
    "These lines right here.",
    "Hi, my name is it a little bit and then we'll do some shadows.",
    "And Uhm.",
    "Some different like I think I'll adjust the colors a little bit, maybe will add like A.",
    "Kind of like in this one has got that kind of glow around it.",
    "Men try something like that.",
    "I will turn it into our sticker.",
    "OK.",
    "So.",
    "Bing.",
    "I'm going to select these pixels, make a new layer going to set it to multiply, and I'm going to do.",
    "It's like a.",
    "Not even more of a pinkish purple.",
    "First can come in here and I'm going to use a soft brush.",
    "But like it needs a little bit of.",
    "Help in the contrast.",
    "So.",
    "This is what?",
    "I did.",
    "What it was.",
    "So I think that'll be.",
    "Better as a sticker.",
    "Like more contrast.",
    "Probably need to go.",
    "Oh, this is very bright on the tail here.",
    "It's just the screen.",
    "Yeah, it's pretty bright.",
    "Gonna go back and add a little bit of.",
    "This blue color in here.",
    "Like this to make it non is like.",
    "Right?",
    "I think that helped it out.",
    "Oh OK, so I'm also going to add are we going to do like A?",
    "Textured kind of.",
    "Can I use my sketch square brush?",
    "We're going to do like a texture to room light.",
    "Up here on top of everything up and you know I normally do like.",
    "Provided.",
    "Color Dodge, even though, like really when you're using white, it doesn't matter that much if you set it to color Dodge 'cause It's going to be the same.",
    "Making for some time.",
    "Oh, we also want to make sure they were just going to turn all of these things are clipping mask.",
    "To be honest.",
    "I think it would workout better that way, so I don't have to worry about like no do I get outside the lines like.",
    "You know?",
    "Less stressful and use clipping mask.",
    "Especially like in a small detail, areas like I don't have to worry about anything, it just kind of.",
    "Draw in less time.",
    "So to create more of a like glowing effect.",
    "So what I'll do is I'll duplicate this layer that I'm creating right now.",
    "And we're going to like blur the bottom one.",
    "It will look like, uhm?",
    "Not like a.",
    "Glowing quality to it almost.",
    "I don't wanna.",
    "So yeah, well.",
    "Take this layer.",
    "Then keep located and the one underneath of it.",
    "We all got up to blur and.",
    "Wow.",
    "Yes.",
    "So I think I blurted too much.",
    "Couldn't really see.",
    "How much I was doing it?",
    "Well but crazy there we go thank that more of a subtle.",
    "So blur.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Pink shiny almost.",
    "From this part of a little bit.",
    "And then I'm going to also add.",
    "The same kind of like.",
    "Um lighting that I have right here, so I think I used more of A.",
    "Warm orange tone and I probably used overlay, but I might have used soft light by definitely use this often brushed.",
    "So we will take this in kind of Yeah.",
    "Something like that.",
    "Hum, so maybe Anita.",
    "I might need to adjust the color a little bit of this.",
    "Going on.",
    "Hum.",
    "Or how to play around with it and see?",
    "How to make your hair look a little bit.",
    "Hum.",
    "Weird.",
    "Not really the color I wanted to go for, but I do like the effect that it has on this blue.",
    "It kind of adds like that orangey tone.",
    "In there.",
    "That's kind of interesting when I pop this over on my other monitor real quick, it is very orange over here that looks more yellow over here.",
    "No no.",
    "Hello.",
    "Bump down saturation.",
    "How did it go?",
    "I lost it.",
    "OK.",
    "I guess I'll do like this final final clean up on my other screen, like here in a minute, so I'm just going to show you guys like.",
    "So I.",
    "Set up the sticker first, so I'm going to hide this.",
    "Phone.",
    "And I'm going to hide the background.",
    "Actually, you know, you know I'm going to make the background.",
    "Black So we can see.",
    "See if there's any kind of uhm.",
    "Messy little lines on the outside like I want this tale to be a little bit sharper.",
    "So we're going to scoop.",
    "Get that.",
    "In a little bit.",
    "And then what they are?",
    "Not wine.",
    "Yes.",
    "So I'll sharpen the Up Time, Is It?",
    "Even though it is going to be white, let's see there's like a little bit right here.",
    "I want to get rid of make sure we define that shape.",
    "Clearly.",
    "Hum, nothing else I wanna get rid of.",
    "What sorry um.",
    "OK, so underneath this layer.",
    "We're gonna make.",
    "An outline.",
    "And what I normally do is I'll take this thin, thin render solid brush in um.",
    "June Skechers complete collection 'cause it's like.",
    "Like you can get like a a clean line from it and I will kind of go in and out of the.",
    "The shape.",
    "I like around the sticker.",
    "So you want it to be like a very smooth.",
    "Line.",
    "Like Confident.",
    "Like strokes.",
    "And if you come from like the inside of the sticker, go out and then come back in and feel like that's the best way to achieve it.",
    "So you want it to be like fairly quick, and you're probably going to have to undo redo.",
    "I mean your son do and then try again.",
    "A lot.",
    "But let's see we want.",
    "You want it to be clean, so like this furry here, can I get a little bit?",
    "Messy, please come in here.",
    "And make the brush a little bit smaller and do it that way.",
    "Um, that's really like I only have to do that for like the pointy end of things.",
    "But I mean, I probably, you know, come back here.",
    "We do this shape 'cause you're really thinking about, like the silhouette at this point.",
    "Um?",
    "And like I want this, this could be a continuous line, even though there's like a little bump right here.",
    "Because we're trying to simplify it.",
    "When I simplify this shape so it's very clear.",
    "For the like, either like if you're gonna cut it yourself like.",
    "You wanted to be like a simple to cut it rather than like you know, I'm not going to go through and do like every well.",
    "I guess that I will, but I'm not going to go do this.",
    "Like I think I'll probably just do that to be honest.",
    "I mean, I do like a little bit.",
    "I don't know.",
    "We'll see how it goes.",
    "Um?",
    "But whether you're cutting by hand or with the cricket you want to.",
    "To be fairly uhm.",
    "Simple.",
    "And readable.",
    "Well, probably like bunch these together.",
    "So what will do in a minute will fill the.",
    "Um?",
    "Fulfill this the entire shape.",
    "And well, expand it.",
    "Still not happy with his part.",
    "You know I don't like.",
    "Completely.",
    "This like this like kind of spikiness up here.",
    "'cause I don't.",
    "I've never made a sticker like that and I feel like it's a unique shape.",
    "Do you believe in and out a little bit?",
    "So we can also, you know kind of go back and see like.",
    "Um?",
    "Like we can go erase some things and then come back to it.",
    "We just want to make sure we zoom back in.",
    "To see.",
    "If it's like helping.",
    "Our design.",
    "Or if it's like working against it because.",
    "Hum, any changes you make you want to make sure it's like helping your design.",
    "Sometimes, like when you get into the work.",
    "Like we don't set back enough to check on that.",
    "You don't think this part is really?",
    "Benefiting anything.",
    "I don't know 'cause I.",
    "Alternatively I can do.",
    "That shape, which I think that's what we're going to do, then it looks better than this mess that I put up here.",
    "I think rotating this would help.",
    "Yeah Mike, I don't like this sleep anymore.",
    "So how we're going to do that?",
    "It's like we're going to.",
    "Control click and select pixels on that layer.",
    "Make a layer underneath of this.",
    "And then we're going to go up to select.",
    "Modify Expand.",
    "And we want to expand her selection by.",
    "We're going to say 20 pixels right now and see what that looks like.",
    "I actually don't like.",
    "You don't like it right here.",
    "I think I'm gonna try to leave that.",
    "So we're going to take that away from our selection.",
    "It doesn't have to be perfect since it's underneath of this, so we're just going to fill that.",
    "Like so.",
    "And.",
    "Um?",
    "The select.",
    "I'm actually going to make a copy of my original.",
    "From Michael border layer.",
    "It's not just like.",
    "I heard that and then I'm gonna merge the two that I just made.",
    "So this is our new selection.",
    "I think that'll workout OK.",
    "I'm a little concerned about down here because.",
    "Um, that's where my cricket usually messes up the cut.",
    "Hum.",
    "Oops.",
    "So maybe I'll just kind of.",
    "Done hearing.",
    "Do this, but do you need somewhere to put my?",
    "Signature as well.",
    "So.",
    "Go ahead and put it down there.",
    "Undertale, and you can even do can use the liquify tool to like push things around a little bit.",
    "So I'm going to get out my.",
    "Let it go.",
    "Signal signature or drop it right there.",
    "And we move it on top of all the layers.",
    "Uhm, this is like different from my normal signature.",
    "I wanted something that looked nice that could be applied to a sticker.",
    "Like in the border part.",
    "And I can like.",
    "No no.",
    "Bend it.",
    "To the shape that I need.",
    "And then I can also go in and just rest arise this layer and actually think of pink might be OK, but I think.",
    "Maybe if we shift it a little bit towards Orange would match a little bit better.",
    "And I think I'm I will need to move the.",
    "The outline a little bit, so we're going to show the backdrop for the, even though it makes it confusing sometimes.",
    "So.",
    "OK.",
    "So that's pretty much it for stickers.",
    "how I make, like all my stickers.",
    "Just do my illustration.",
    "And.",
    "You know, I'll go back and.",
    "Underneath of it, whenever I'm done, I'll make my cut outline for my cricket and make sure it's like pretty sharp.",
    "On the edges.",
    "And like a very clear design.",
    "And then align my little signature down there.",
    "Come to finish it up.",
    "So I will.",
    "I'm actually going to print these right after I get off of the stream.",
    "And.",
    "I guess I can maybe?",
    "Put an Instagram story up if you guys wanna see.",
    "The stickers on their done.",
    "So I'm not going to do it on stream because my computer, I mean my printer like gives me issues sometimes.",
    "Thanks to.",
    "You know, shut down.",
    "Argus, like, forget the Wi-Fi or something, I don't know.",
    "It's weird.",
    "But that's frustrating, so it takes awhile and I also need to make sure these colors.",
    "We're looking good.",
    "Find my other screen.",
    "I guess I could should probably change it to like.",
