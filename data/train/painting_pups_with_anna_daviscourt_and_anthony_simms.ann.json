    "Sorry, that was another plug for you to have to join the discord to get an answer, but like I genuinely don't remember what it is and my husband is also an artist and he uses the iPad when I am not, so he's probably got it in the other room right now.",
    "I was thinking of making him kind of like a cream and alike Brown spots.",
    "What do you think?",
    "Anthony Freeman Brown spots?",

    "Absolutely always animals and its creatures of all kinds.",
    "OK, whether you live with them or not.",
    "Is that weird?",

    "There's a community.",
    "OK, you guys, and it's bustling.",
    "And the only problem is trying to first of all catch it because there's like a specifically a muskrat that goes down on Creek and like he's there for maybe 5 seconds.",
    "So it's not all set a time to catch him and then other than that, like you kind of want to appreciate the moment and just be like.",
    "That's so cool.",
    "It's like the spirit of the Creek is right there.",
    "You don't see him everyday and you can't tell when it's going to happen, and I don't even bring my phone with me on every walk, so it's a hard thing to actually capture, but it would be so cool to capture it.",
    "'cause Oh my gosh, so many fun things live outside.",
    "We found a crowd as have like a hatch of babies that they take care of on their underbelly and we actually saw that like a big crowded with a bunch of Little Crawdads underneath it.",
    "And it was so magical looking like just in amongst the little brush at the edge of the Creek.",
    "So cool.",
    "And we've got a healthy.",
    "What would you call it?",
    "School of fish?",
    "These like tiny little fish, but they're all over the Creek and and a giant.",
    "What do you call it towed baby?",
    "Polliwog yeah.",
    "I guess it's bigger than a with the little ones called Tadpoles Castle.",
    "Bigger than a tadpole, but not a full fledged frog yet.",
    "and I thought maybe it was a plecostomus 'cause it looks like it was clinging to a rock and had a little tail, but Anthony is convinced that that was a polliwog or whatever.",
    "I think it might still be considered a tadpole because it didn't have.",
    "Catholics are back legs.",
    "Yeah, but it was so big like Man, I'm not going to make a heck of a toad or frog.",
    "I don't know.",
    "They balloon after awhile 'cause they have to become big burly fraud.",
    "Frogs, kind of the cousin to the bull frog.",

    "Still lambs but giant sometimes the horses also from a different neighborhood come by and cows.",
    "I love it so much.",
    "Farm animals have a special place in my heart because they've always been behind defense like I just want to pet a cow.",
    "Can I please just stop at the side of the road when I see a farm with calves on it and just put a cow?",
    "Is that allowed?",
    "Probably not, but I really want to do it.",
    "I just want to cattle.",
    "But you know, there's certain places you can go to that take care of like rescued farm animals.",
    "and I really want to visit one of those too, because I think that would be.",
    "I mean then you're just paying admission towards those animals lives and that feels good.",
    "Do you know Jenny Nicholson used to work at a petting farm in Disneyland?",
    "No way.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Pretty interesting petting farm at Disneyland.",
    "I've never heard of anything.",
    "I think they got rid of it to make room for other attractions, but she did choose.",
    "I don't know like anytime that there's animals involved.",
    "I worry about their well being and especially with so many people coming through that could be really hazardous thing.",
    "Like you can't always just like kids, especially when if they pull on the tail of an animal and they had like get kicked in the face or whatever you know like it could be a really bad situation really quickly.",
    "Maybe that's just a negative way of looking at it, but like I want people to be able to appreciate animals.",
    "But the most important thing is that you're not causing the animals any harm.",
    "So I wonder how that went down, like if it was always a good thing.",
    "I'm sure there's always like a one off thing, but by and by every time I've been to a petting zoo, nobody's been like trampled or beating up the animals.",
    "Well, OK, at our Oregon Zoo Petting Zoo area, they only admit like a few people at a time, so hopefully that's everywhere where it's not just like everybody openly pet, but I think that my stuff in the case because she said it wasn't a very popular attraction.",
    "'cause when people go to Disneyland they are there for the rides and queuing up for the bigger things.",
    "And this was more for like.",
    "Kids that couldn't go on some of the rides, people that just commit go on rides because it was too intense or whatever, and this was just like a nice relaxing spot for people to just come and chill out a little bit.",
    "I'd be all about it, man.",
    "Also very small section.",
    "It was like a bedroom size, probably with only a few animals from the clip that I saw.",
    "The better I think.",
    "Yeah, in the chat we've got Kindle saying Pollywogg just made me think of that one Pok\u00e9mon and then it goes on to say I put the cows.",
    "If they let me usually my doggo scares them away though.",
    "It's true he's in bed, in several different rooms, so.",
    "Normal i'ma nomads just like ang Jackson drew a picture of him, posted it in the current window.",
    "My gosh Segway.",
    "Yes, let's show that.",
    "OK, so we've got a current work tab on the discord so you guys can show off your awesome artwork and I also post here and we've got a beautiful ang boy.",
    "Oh my gosh, my boy look at him oh, he's so good and I love his outfit off the shoulder.",
    "He's amazing, oh, I actually was thinking about doing more of this in my characters where it feels like the risk goes a little bit chunkier.",
    "I actually love that kind of styling of things, so I want to try that with my next my next round, but I love this outfit design that you've done.",
    "He looks very determined as ang do as I do.",
    "Is he your favorite character?",
    "Anthony Jackson from Avatar the Last Airbender.",
    "We've also got Sammy who learned her work schedule and just said like no to it.",
    "Special already tired.",
    "Sad, I'm sorry, but this is a beautiful drawing and I really hope that you actually have a sweater that matches your hair perfectly.",
    "So she Anthony.",
    "Yeah, and then Johanna actually made Halloween Crunch.",
    "Oh my gosh, so we've got more Halloween themed cereals and just I think we thought of Count Chocula was there like one other one but we need more in the world is like spooky Chris.",
    "Which is that a real thing?",
    "Or is it a thing you just made up as like a funky crisp is the real serial but spooky Chris is a fake serial.",
    "I thought we were coming up with fake serial no.",
    "I'm saying like real ones 'cause Calculus, a real Halloween themed cereal.",
    "Halloween Crunch is a real serial.",
    "No that ones made up but I just wanted to know like what really I think.",
    "Count Chocula I mean so that only comes out in October, no, but there seemed like Count Chocula.",
    "Their count is at Dracula like character, so like that is Halloween themed, even if it's all year round.",
    "Let us out.",
    "But there could be a lot more like marshmallows that are shaped like bones.",
    "Come on, why we not done that yet?",
    "And it had a nice, satisfying crunched.",
    "Exactly, that's why Halloween Crunches.",
    "Oh my gosh.",
    "Perfect use around the chat saying lol.",
    "I'm rearranging now after I thought no no.",

    "I think that she was assembling IKEA piece for some reason.",
    "That's really like therapeutic to me.",
    "What do you guys feel about IKEA?",
    "'cause like I love it.",
    "I love putting together that stuff and being like yes, this is what I'm doing right now, nothing else.",
    "Yeah, if it's going smoothly, but if you get to a point it's just not fitting or it's just like really frustrating puzzles where it's like there's a satisfying amount of challenge, but if it goes beyond that, it's just frustration.",
    "Yeah, totally, but I think the only time that I felt that was when we were putting together my Dresser which had drawers, which is like moving parts that have to fit perfectly to make it smooth.",
    "And eventually it worked out.",
    "But I had a few pinched fingers that was.",
    "That was pretty rough.",
    "Now being the chancing oh too cute, this is sunglasses Anna Q and then that goes on to say to get a new backgrounds.",
    "Yeah Heather in the truck saying hey I'm not stopping to say Hello Hello Heather great which other is this I will see.",

    "Thank you all for coming, but I'm also really excited that you came today because we're finishing potato.",
    "We're just working on this one post for now and then I think, how about we move on to these guys?",
    "'cause as I said before, sometimes it's better for me to start with the rough work and then work two refined, but my mind always is like this is where we left off last time.",
    "It's like a video game you just like take the.",
    "Pick up where you left off, but hey, ain't nobody give me rules I can do whatever I want so let's do rough work yeah, rough dog, come on.",

    "Absolutely I would love to see that and your own homework, but you've assigned to yourself.",
    "But excellent.",
    "Oh wait, you're doing school motion, aren't you?",
    "Yes, I would love to see that continue.",

    "Apparently there where did we learn that that their saliva so viscous that the cow lick like stays up?",
    "It's like a sick.",

    "and I started drawing with like really bubbly lines.",
    "What would you call that like the warble 2:00 AM.",
    "And I liked it, so I kept going and I'd say I think that this top one might be my favorite, like this line area, especially around his side is just.",
    "It makes me happy.",

    "Oh my gosh, amazing, you just go knowing like I'm going to be around animals.",
    "It's gonna get dirty is fine, you just clean up afterward.",
    "So if I go to the farm I know that I'm going to get cowlicked.",
    "I'm down.",
    "Oh my gosh though.",
    "But yeah, I think that most heading zoos have like medium range so not too small, not too big of animals.",
    "One of my favourites as a kid I don't even know if it was really is strictly a petting zoo, but like a farm stands that we would go to every once in awhile and visit the IT was alpacas that they had and there was one called honey that was my absolute favorite and we would just like fawn over her for hours and then one day she was gone and we were like Oh no what happened.",

    "So I thought today maybe we could get some different ingredients to kind of switch up the profile of tastes that we can create in our kitchen and then branch out to new dishes.",
    "And maybe that would kind of fill the void of what I'm missing.",
    "A lot of it is Thai food.",
    "I just crave Thai food specifically.",
    "I feel like I need some sprouts, and maybe that's just my body telling me what nutrition it wants.",
