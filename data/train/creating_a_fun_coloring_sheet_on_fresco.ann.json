    "So I'm already doubting my choice of doing this pattern live just because.",
    "Like drawing circles, live is always the most nerve wrecking think as they never look good when your freehand circles, and then if I just do them on my own, I'm not too worried, but when other people are watching, I'm just so aware of how uneven the circles are.",
    "Yeah, I mean Switzerland is pretty cool.",
    "It's also really really far back in terms of a lot of.",
    "A lot of things, which is part of why I didn't really want to stay like you know, women only got the right to vote here in like the 70s, and in one of the cantons, which is our word for state.",
    "It wasn't till.",
    "The 90s that was the last one that held of-, which is just insane.",
