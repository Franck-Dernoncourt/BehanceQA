    "Place.",
    "We don't need a mirror finish on this summer.",
    "It.",

    "OK, so.",
    "I so very clearly see that is filing, especially with some of these more distinct figures like we have a bit of an arch here and you can see that repeating several times here.",
    "And that's just one of the.",
    "I'm just not really much you can do about that in the texture itself.",
    "When you applied them too.",
    "I didn't like.",

    "Video, then you can kind of paint away.",
    "This would be more useful if you have a picture of the ground and if there was like a cigarette, but early for something you wanted to get rid of.",
    "This would definitely come in handy.",
    "But we can do it for the granite here as well, just to get rid of.",
    "Some of this more distinct features.",
    "Good.",
    "I guess already fixed the normal I already forgot about it, OK?",
    "Just thinking to myself would be if we took this material and.",
    "Did stuff with it.",
    "Very descriptive thought I know, but what I'm saying is that would be cool to take it in like break it up into rocks like we did.",
    "No reason we couldn't do that like.",
    "Like the the trick with Alchemist is going to be that you kind of just need your base materials.",
    "It's a bit confusing terminology considering.",
    "Base material into the spec on saying it's like.",
    "If you think about any any old material save ground material is just.",
    "It's made up of.",
    "A series of different.",
    "Try not to use the word material over.",
    "Of different substances like like a rocky ground might have a rock material in it, a dirty under.",
    "Leaves and debris and then maybe some grass or Moss.",
    "So if you have like those components broken down then you can kind of just make any old.",
    "Anything you want with just those five, but every components in them.",
    "Pikmin to Alchemist and.",
    "And do what she really fun.",
    "And was cookie.",
    "After OK, so we got a pretty good.",
    "Granite countertop material here.",
    "And it's a lot like what's in my house, so.",
    "It's gotta count for something.",
    "Just add a little bit more.",
    "Can you get a better look at it?",
    "We can go ahead and.",
    "Apparently, break everything.",
    "Back Press the right button, then go ahead and look at it on a few different.",
    "Objects here.",
    "Like this Who created shoe?",
    "Is cloth and looks really cool?",
    "Maybe maybe it's a bit bit too glossy.",
    "Turn that back a bit.",
    "I gotta be honest, I want to add.",
    "Some kind of roughness variation to this?",
    "And it's very uniformly smooth and clean, but I haven't.",
    "Really found the best way to do that.",
    "Yet here designer at least.",
    "I played around with like bringing in dust dirt.",
    "She only did dust.",
    "We can try dirt, don't know if it'll help though.",
    "Taking lunch.",
    "I don't think it would.",
    "Yeah, it's very harsh on.",
    "You don't really have.",
    "The ability to change then.",
    "But Ertz roughness here.",
    "I basically just want to add a little bit of a noise over it.",
    "If we could, we could end up with a mask.",
    "Then headed noise texture on it, but.",
    "Still need a way to.",
    "And exclude.",
    "Dirt from.",
    "Have you done any color information?",
    "Please give it.",
    "I'm trying to say.",
    "I think that's that's kind of terrible.",
    "You pass, it doesn't seem to do much.",
    "I forgot about that.",
    "Right, right this variation for the time being.",
    "Now not to look into that and see if there's anything we could.",
    "And it's actually.",
    "You took the shine down a little bit too much.",
    "Seems about right for those countertops.",
    "I am so Super Simple.",
    "As Super simple of material here might bring it back and play with it later, but for now we're going to move on to a image that's slightly more complex.",
    "Not terribly so, but.",
    "And it has a little bit more going on to it will have a little bit of death.",
    "I didn't get that open.",
    "Add a couple of pictures of just some country from my backyard and also apparently tomatoes in the corner said look at that.",
    "Um?",
    "Yeah, not a, not a Queen photo, not great lighting conditions, but I want to see what we can do with these.",
    "Stick with.",
    "First one.",
    "All I'm gonna do.",
    "Add new material, OK, whatever.",
    "Grab it on over.",
    "And for now, we just need to the map.",
    "Write software to R2D view here.",
    "We are going to go ahead and right off the bat rolled down a rock.",
    "And then I'm going to switch over.",
    "That switch over to scan your excuse me deep.",
    "Turn off that for now.",
    "'cause right now we don't have a base color or any other channels because it's the material is just an image at the moment.",
    "And so we got the image shared.",
    "And look down here in the bottom left.",
    "Traffic look down here in the bottom left hand.",
    "We're going to look at those.",
    "That resolution number Henry had put that in here.",
    "But it right?",
    "3032 by in 1961.",
    "But It is often photo so.",
    "I expect right?",
    "Then we get that let's go ahead and.",
    "It's going to drop this if we go out and Turner crop on.",
    "Doing a little bit better.",
    "Mildly.",
    "Almost easier just to leave it like that.",

    "The side we're going to head little naked square button.",
    "Would be nice and square.",
    "You know what I might go for?",
    "Something in the center here.",
    "So now let's crop.",
    "We go ahead and.",
