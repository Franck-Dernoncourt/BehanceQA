    "Just make sure I delete those cool, take this out and I'm going to turn this white now.",
    "Cool Bates control save.",
    "Save on my desktop.",
    "Desktop Zelda sleigh PNG sword.",
    "Oh All right now I can go into here.",
    "Pull this out.",
    "This is much better.",
    "We're going to delete these.",
    "Those those ugly AF.",
    "And for some of you who are like.",
    "A list of color.",
    "Who are thinking you know, Brandon, why you pulling these things from Google?",
    "The real recent is obviously there's assets that you can buy these sort of things like from Adobe stock.",
    "Places like creative market and you can.",
    "You can buy like these, you just have to pay for more.",
    "You can look to see if the things that you're pulling off of Google have a license or a free license.",
    "So let's see.",
    "Joins asking a question.",
    "How do you usually connect with design?",
    "The design with developers?",
    "Man, that's a good question.",
    "So when it comes to.",
    "Connecting Or building the bridge between design and developers is.",
    "You really have to understand that.",
    "Nobody should be fighting on who's right and who's wrong you.",
    "There's right, there's a goal in mind.",
    "Build this product like this and then it just so happens you know for client whoever they have a certain solution that they need to solve their problems in.",
    "Help them get over the pain points.",
    "The first in line is somebody who's doing the research, and then it becomes the designers job to build something off of that research, and then once something is built you are then going to communicate what you want built with developer and it's a very important based off of.",
    "The constraints of the project developer has constraints as well, like sometimes something that we have in mind that Super Fancy and animated.",
    "Won't be able to run really well on certain websites.",
    "However you can have the conversation with them and say Hey look, this is what I have in mind.",
    "I also researched some things and some other people who are able to implement this.",
    "This is how they implemented it.",
    "Can we do that as well?",
    "And some people have who are really advanced and they'll be able to work with you and do that.",
    "Some other people you have to educate them a little bit, but it's never somebody else's job to figure out what you want to build.",
    "It's your job to if you want to do something is to either educate yourself to educate other people so you get the way.",
    "You know, help them grow to get what you want, but it's all about how you control what you do to get the results that you want to.",
    "Want to get just in a team within a team of people, so I hope that answers your question.",
    "Um, let's see in house is limiting because I feel like.",
    "The like designing is inflexible since you are tide to a design systems.",
    "Yeah man, that's why I don't like it.",
    "I know I just cursed in there be hands like send them off.",
    "But basically you know design systems is a little boring and you know to go.",
    "Around that are to discuss with the people who created design system that needs to be changed or updated is a constant battle so.",
    "It's difficult, but not difficult.",
    "Takes time and you really have to decide whether or not.",
    "Do you would rather spend that time or just like do your own thing that you have control over and do that?",
    "So I chose to do my own thing.",
    "So alright where were We?",
    "I always get a.",
    "Get a sidetracked geologist, CI asking good questions out here.",
    "Alright, we need a potion icon.",
    "Let's see, so these are.",
    "Hum.",
    "Let's see what happens if we put this in photo shop Jack.",
    "Is this an SVG 2?",

    "Alright cool, so we're going to open this up with.",
    "Left auto.",
    "All I want.",
    "Is the black don't make a new layer.",
    "Fill that with white.",
    "I can just delete that.",
    "I'm going to save this.",
    "As a PNG over top my potion jump now say.",
    "Um?",
    "See.",
    "This kind of looks a little busted.",
    "Let's see what this looks like.",
    "Hold on.",
    "Oh, that works.",
    "That works, right?",
    "Something that works.",
    "We had our sword.",

    "I am so upset.",
    "I was like What is this potions blah blah blah or blah blah blah and everybody was like Brandon that's potions.",
    "So how do we want to lay this out?",
    "Again?",
    "I'm going to go back and get my reference photo.",
    "Turn that jump on.",
    "I don't know where it went.",
    "Oh that's why are we trying to pass it all the way down?",
    "I lied it is right here.",
    "OK so I'm gonna pull this up just a little bit just so I can see get the reference of the size of these babies.",
    "Select all of this, size it down.",
    "Pull this here one.",
    "2.",
    "3.",
    "Think that works.",
    "I'm going to turn this back off for now.",
    "I think this needs to be a little bit bigger and I also wanted this looks like a bomb.",
    "I don't look like that.",
    "It was a little jaggedy too.",
    "We just everybody pretend it doesn't look like that alright just for now will fix it in post.",
    "Let's go ahead and get some some size guides on these.",
    "Wash hands, wash hands, Lausanne what is that for?",
    "Pull that up and we're also going to make this.",
    "How to export file from XD to showcase?",
    "And be hands my man first thing designed the thing second thing is figure out what you want it to look like.",
    "I can just make a case study find somebody that you actually absolutely like on.",
    "Be hands, figure out how they layout their case.",
    "Study and just figure out how you can layout your case.",
    "Study as well.",
    "In my mind it's as simple.",
    "Simple as that, so I'm just going to go ahead and.",
    "Turn these down its head.",
    "What I want to do, let's see.",
    "So we have this.",
    "Hum.",
    "And we have.",

    "Or Gray Turn down just a little bit.",
    "Alright, I kind of want this down here.",
    "Alright, so let's see what am I thinking.",
    "Enjoyed this good question.",
    "My man is as simple as this.",
    "Design what you want in Adobe XD.",
    "Find some really dope case studies in UI UX.",
    "Right?",
    "Will just pop into here for example.",
    "Make your design right.",
    "This is your design.",
    "Find some mockups Popham in there.",
    "Write about it a little bit and this is no you can buy this sort of layout in this mockup on places like ui.net.",
    "Same thing like this.",
    "This is no different.",
    "Daylily recorded their output from either something like after effects or it will be XD and they found a mock up to put it in.",
    "It's pretty straightforward.",
    "Same thing with this.",
    "Just go to placeslikeyouate.com up down or by mockups for your designs.",
    "Put 'em in the mockups.",
    "Make a case study.",
    "Alright, let's start 'cause there's a couple things I need to do.",
    "First off, let's grab \u20b91.",
    "OK.",
    "Let's get one of these.",
    "I think this one looks nice, it just needs to be a little bit sharper.",
    "So let's see if we can find a cleaner one.",
    "Where is the clean?",
    "Why can't I find a clean Ruby guys?",
    "Yeah.",
    "I guess we will make.",

    "And save it as a PNG.",
    "There we go.",
    "Control save, save to your computer PNG.",
    "And Ruby maybe?",

    "I, you know, I my workflow is.",
    "XD2 What I keep opening at X D2 web flow 100% of the time.",
    "Most likely if I'm not already working with a developer, so let's see.",
    "So I want this to kind of be our wallet.",
    "Let me do this.",
    "And you know, it's interesting.",
    "I'm actually going to.",
    "I didn't think I was going to do this, but I think I might actually take this bar idea 'cause I like it.",
    "Let's go back in here this turn back our reference.",

    "And let's see, we still have.",
    "No, quite a bit to go, so let's see.",

    "We're going to open up a reference one more time.",
    "'cause I want to see what they have.",
    "Actually it's right down here.",

    "Alright, so we kind of had to do a little work around for that.",
    "Not two in love with how this is looking here, but we can go back and refine that if needed.",
    "I am going to pull this over here.",
    "I'm just going to flip it.",
    "And we can always go back into Photoshop If I wanted to go in and edit that and we will.",
    "But we kind of want to get this set up to begin with.",

    "See see what that look like.",
    "I don't like it.",
    "I am not in favor.",
    "Let's see, so that's that.",
    "Looks like I'm going to see what this looks like if we just do that.",

    "And we're also can do this.",
    "We can do it.",
    "We're going to do this.",
    "And tail in asking the question here.",
    "Yes, I do design all of my stuff in one file.",
    "Adobe XT is super fat like this is so vast an it's really performing in terms of I don't care how big the file is, it will never freaking lag unlike quote, unquote other name brands.",
    "Out there in the market today who die as soon as you open something up.",
    "So we're going to shop.",
    "We're going to do adventure login system.",
    "And that's a great question.",
    "God was asking How long did it take to learn web flow?",
    "Absolute like 2 weeks Max.",
    "It's very similar to if you're used to photo shop.",
    "Or any other editing program like Adobe XD.",
    "It's it's super simple, so I highly recommend anybody who is wanting to learn to take control of you know.",
    "That side of the design phase or that part of the building Phase I highly recommend you get on that ASAP.",
    "And if you guys are curious about web flow, definitely check out.",
    "My man ran seagull.",
    "He's absolutely amazing at teaching people how to use web slow in just a matter of hours and so that you guys can just be super valuable when you have your next client engagement, etc.",
    "So let's see, alright, so we're almost there.",
    "We have pretty much our basic layout here.",
    "What I'm going to go ahead and do is I'm going to grab.",
    "Oh icons I want to grab a close icon really quick.",
    "Super simple, it's in my plugin called icons for design.",
    "I'm just going to go.",
    "Back here.",
    "But I'll make this white.",
    "Make sure it's in line with everything here.",
    "I also want to make sure this is 50 three from the edge.",
    "I also want to make that this is.",
    "53 excellent, alright.",
    "Another thing I might want to do is I actually might want to use this not big fan of this orange guys.",
    "I kind of want to use like a nice Golden if you guys have you guys watched me an Adobe live last time I actually created a.",
    "Let's see.",
    "Go to.",
    "Hum.",
    "Where is.",
    "This is the recordings.",
    "Basically I made this last time and this is the type of gold that I won.",
    "So this is actually what I'm going to do and pull this in.",
    "'cause I want to reference some colors.",
    "Now.",
    "'cause I absolutely love this this look here, but you know, I don't really care for this orange.",
    "Maybe it will find a way to put it in it, but I like the gold.",
    "I always feel like that that.",
    "Makes us feel like we're in an adventure.",
    "So this we're going to do I might even switch some stuff up here.",
    "Let's see this.",
    "I am going to.",
    "I might actually pull in some link to assets.",
    "From, Uh?",
    "My Zelda It's actually do that.",
    "Pulled in the components.",
    "Let's see.",
    "I want to be 2.",
    "There we go so we can get some of these gradients in here.",
    "So I'm going to put this in.",
    "This is the lighter side and put that over here.",
    "This is the darker side and put that over there.",
    "Um, to learn after effects, you know.",
    "That was, to be honest, longer than uhm.",
    "Then, Webflow after effects, depending on what it is that you're trying to learn.",
    "It could take some time, but you know that's all it is.",
    "It takes time, and that's about it.",
    "If you are patient.",
    "And you just pick what type of things you want to learn and just focus on those you're in the clear.",
    "Let's see here.",
    "I want.",
    "Kind of dug.",
    "The indicator that we had here so nice glow so we might try to replicate something like.",
    "Something like that.",
    "So let's do let us do that.",
    "Copy paste this.",
    "We are going to do.",
    "Do some little bit too.",
    "I'm going to one.",
    "To grab these both.",
    "3 and then I'm also going to do this one more time.",
    "I'm going to.",
    "Make this one below.",
    "I'm going to make it sure that it has a border of white.",
    "No, make it inside.",
    "And turn this stroke up just a little bit.",
    "Cool.",
    "So now I'm going to put this over top.",
    "Everything.",
    "And I'm going to select 12345.",
    "Command ship.",
    "Go in here.",
    "Just turn off these strokes.",
    "Boom I'm going to turn this.",
    "Pass it up all the way.",
    "Here there we go, so a little bit different.",
    "I'm going to put this back into place.",
    "There we go.",
    "Alright, now instead of white 'cause it is pretty horse, we're going to go ahead and put that green.",
    "Almost that green color and well, we also might pull.",
    "Some of these hours are going to hit shift.",
    "Right arrow.",
    "Right arrow.",
    "Up 1 Looks about right.",
    "Make all of these.",
    "My yellow.",
    "Or my green whatever.",
    "That color is same thing there.",
    "All right?",
    "Now what we can do, we gotta gotta find a couple things.",
    "But we're going to start.",
    "2.",
    "Let's pretend we are on, so we're going to put this opacity down to 40.",
    "We're going to pretend we're on.",
    "The potions are going to go to 100.",
    "And we are.",
    "Going to start putting in, We're going to go back to my.",
    "Assets here.",
    "I'm going to link assets one more time, 'cause I think I backtracked enough to wear.",
    "Didn't have them anymore, right?",
    "Great?",

    "Straighten them up.",
    "We're going to find some weapons to as well.",
    "12 3.",
    "We're going to go ahead and grab some guides.",

    "Little bit.",
    "Now there's a couple things that we have to you know.",
    "I almost feel like I don't want these icons here.",
    "Reason being is because we're not going to have enough items.",
    "I want all these different types of items to be here as a as a shop and maybe we can have each thing here be like a mini icon to symbolize groups.",
    "You know what?",
    "Each one of these things is, maybe like in.",
    "The corner of each one of these that might be interesting.",
    "So what we're going to do?",
    "Because I cannot decide right now.",

    "I'm going to add a buy button.",
    "At the bottom here and just change first of all, I'm going to undo.",

    "I'm going to pull this in just a little bit.",
    "I don't know what do you guys think.",
    "Should this button go here or?",
    "Should I?",

    "I feel like this might be better.",
    "Not entirely sure, but let me know in the comments what are your thoughts?",
    "'cause we can have.",
    "This or.",
    "That real quick.",
    "Pull this out.",

    "I'm actually going to put in the chat really quick to my.",
    "Gross that yeah.",

    "and I want to basically be able for him to purchase items from his sheikah slate.",
    "And not have to go to market or have to fight monsters of one now basically Amazon on his sleep.",

    "I wonder if it's smart if we put this.",
    "Down here.",
    "I'm deleting that.",
    "I'm really interested.",
    "To know We have to figure out some.",
    "Here's one thing that's bothering me.",

    "So let's see.",
    "It is called the.",
    "Chicest later something.",

    "And we're going to try to change this really quick.",
    "I want like a gold or yellow.",
    "I think that's going to work now.",
    "Hit control, save, go back.",
    "The copy this.",

    "I'm glad you guys are feeling Chatty, Chatty in the app.",
    "Or a?",
    "Comfortable, two chances are going to do guys so I am going to.",
    "Go into this, grab this turn on repeat grid and I'm going to start sending.",
    "And creating a whole bunch, I'm going to close the distance between them.",
    "Keep making him and kind of use him as a pattern almost right.",
    "Pull this to the top.",
    "Bring this back down.",
    "Oh There we go.",
    "I'm going to go back just one more time.",
    "When it turned the opacity of this down 'cause I don't want it too intrusive.",
    "So we got a little something back.",
    "There's just just for texture.",
    "Um, alright so next.",
    "And I also realized that were on the wrong on the wrong are bored, so I'm going to copy this.",
    "Put it back down here.",
    "Just push it all the way to the back and bring it up some.",
    "Alright bye now.",
    "I want there to be away.",
    "That yes, this is the.",
    "You know this is the shop we're going to put in some circles here to indicate where we are and where.",
    "It could be so 123.",
    "We're going to take these failures out.",
    "Also, going to change these border colors too are at the 60 green and we are going to turn the border off of this and change that filter that green that we used earlier so we have shop where in the center and we also have adventure log and system settings or in this case.",
    "Because we're going to try to pretend like link is a real thing, I kinda wanted to like life settings.",
    "And To Do List.",
    "Just to keep it, you know, a little real.",
    "56 Well, actually bring this little bit closer.",
    "Going to do 30.",
    "30 and 30 alright save on that.",
    "Also actually.",
    "I wanna do control C Control V want to make this a little bit bigger.",
    "I'm going to fill it with a linear gradient.",
    "I'm going to go into my assets going to actually click this, send this to the back I really like.",
    "This sort of this look that you know this is white.",
    "And that is that gold look.",
    "That's kind of what I want to have.",
    "Everything look like almost.",
    "So let's see.",
    "I wonder?",
    "Will just leave that for now.",
    "What I do want, though I'm going to turn this border.",
    "Off Control C Control V.",
    "Send that to the back.",
    "I want the background.",
    "To be that gold as well.",

    "Different here.",
    "So we have that now.",
    "You guys will see that there is gold as well.",
    "Infiltrating this Brown that we don't want.",
    "So what I'm gonna do is I'm going to control copy paste that black an I'm going to also select the gold hit control shift M.",
    "Should be an inverse map.",
    "See.",
    "There we go, that's we want.",
    "So now what we have, I basically just hit this icon in the corner.",
    "So now in the back.",
    "This here was masked in the center, so it's basically a border for what we have here, and I do want to change the direction of this.",
    "Gradients.",
    "So this is the dark.",
    "This is the light.",
    "Right here.",
    "Dark at the bottom.",
    "I actually might put the light here.",
    "And dark at the bottom over here will see what that looks like.",
    "And I'm sure you guys can tell you really.",
    "I really love this sort of like gold effect.",
    "Massive designs I'm glad you're having a blast in the chat.",
    "Do one more thing to take the border off this I kind of want to do the same thing that we did here on.",
    "Our other On the edge of this.",
    "So what I'm going to do is I am.",
    "First off, I want to.",
    "Kurt Want to pull this in over here for some reason maybe that will work.",
    "I have no idea.",
    "Um?",
    "Now I'm just going to be on the left.",
    "So we have our by now.",
    "We have our currency.",
    "We need to have a price associated with this.",
    "All right?",
    "So let's see.",
    "Maybe we can put this back on the top again.",
    "We're going to do this.",
    "We're going to pull this up.",
    "Now we're just trying to center everything again.",
    "Here we're going to group these.",
    "And we're just going to push these down just a little bit.",
    "And we're going to.",
    "We're going to create a.",
    "Now the rectangle.",
    "Just a little bit longer.",
    "This time we're going to send it to the back and bring it up just a little bit.",
    "We are now going to get our gradient here.",
    "I'm going to go in and we're going to switch it.",
    "So we have.",
    "There we go.",
    "Now what I kind of want to do here.",
    "I want to 1st I'll take that border off.",
    "I want to add some.",
    "Some texture.",
    "OK.",
    "Wait, hold on, can you turn up the volume a little?",

    "It is weird, so it's got the gold and the scratches.",
    "Overlay.",
    "Softly.",
    "Hard like.",
    "Color now.",
    "Luminosity.",

    "Listen.",
    "OK.",
    "And the reason, if you're wondering why I didn't put it in here.",
