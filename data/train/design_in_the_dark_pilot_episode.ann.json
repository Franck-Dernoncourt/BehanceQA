    "Look alive.",
    "Google and then you will not have the stream pulled up and so if there are chat questions or anything then I'll do it there alive right now.",
    "So like I'm literally broadcasting over something so we won't go anywhere.",
    "I have nothing to look at.",
    "Like you said it cold for this entire giant like Ultra wide is just of Lady Gaga.",
    "Oh why?",
    "Just like because that's the vibe right now.",
    "That's why I have been reflecting off of Maine.",
    "Liquor chromatica cover it's not the cover, but it's like her in the outfit with like a pink background.",
    "Cool yes, that feels right with claw hand and stuff.",
    "People alright welcome.",
    "How are there people here?",
    "How did you just hop in?",
    "I don't understand.",
    "Hello and welcome friends to the stream um.",
    "OK, we're just going to jump in, so here's what we're doing today.",
    "We were testing a pilot for an idea that we have for a reoccuring show on Adobe Live.",
    "And yes, Melinda, we're trying this one more time.",
    "So the first episode in theory will be literally a week and a half from today.",
    "So today we need to nail it so high Sam this is your pilot episode of Design in the dark.",
    "We're just going to hop in and kind of give you the rundown.",
    "So I'm here with my friend, Logan Farber High Logan.",
    "Hello, So what we will be doing today is will be doing a very fun challenge.",
    "We like to call design in the dark.",
    "How it works is this Logan will get a brief and he will be creating a asset for a client not knowing what it is.",
    "So I will have the whole brief and I'll read that to you.",
    "But on the other hand I'll be art directing Logan to get to our final results, but I won't be able to see his screen, so this is a practice in visual communication of an collaboration, so it'll be really fun if you're in chat, feel free to comment, give me clues.",
    "Give Logan clues.",
    "At no point will he be able to see the brief of what we are making and at no point will I be able to see his screen, so it's going to be a fun, fun time, and I have all my monitors covered.",
    "There's no way that I could see anything that's going on.",
    "If you see me looking over the side, it's because Logan's face is over here, not the screen.",
    "So Logan.",
    "Are you ready?",
    "I am.",
    "I think I'm ready to.",
    "I think this is going to be fun.",
    "Let me go ahead and start out the stream by having you take off your headphones and I will signal you when we're ready.",
    "We're going to go over the brief with all of our friends and chat.",
    "Go hang out with Lady Gaga.",
    "Alright Friends, now that he's gone, I am super excited because here is our brief for today.",
    "Today will be waking a uh, a box cover for a video game design in the style is fantasy adventure and here's the brief.",
    "We're launching a new game called all alone into vast open world fantasy game with creatures and characters around every corner.",
    "We want to capture an idea of mystery, so we're going to be working with Logan and try to create that idea of mystery.",
    "And let's go ahead and start now.",
    "Alright Logan, I'm going to push, oh, I can signal back.",
    "There we go.",
    "Alright, let's bring Logan back in.",
    "That was funny.",
    "I like I finished and I was like Alright Logan, let's get started and I'm like no if you can't hear us but it really is like the weirdest sensory deprivation design show ever.",
    "Alright, so this will be the only time that I look at your screen just because I need to confirm that it's working.",
    "Can you Draw Something on your screen for us real quick?",
    "We were doing it all right.",
    "It is working.",
    "It is working.",
    "So chat if you need at any point.",
    "I want to follow Logan or I underneath us our names.",
    "You can find us on social media and if you need to catch up on what's happening up at the top is always our client, our asset and our brief so you can read that and make sure that you're in the know when neither of us are fully in the know.",
    "So OK, yes for our client.",
    "Lady Gaga.",
    "Yes, so we're going to start out.",
    "Logan and I think that are size is going to be working in photo shop.",
    "Our size is going to be like let's say like 5 by 7.",
    "OK.",
    "Yeah, like a.",
    "Like a.",
    "Let's see, this is too big.",
    "If this is too big, then I'm trying to think of like a four by 6, like a card that was an 8 by 10 and that was way too big.",
    "So I think yeah, like a 5 by 7 ish I think will be good.",
    "But yeah, just just like that I can see.",
    "Wow, that's alright.",
    "It's weird, it's weird, right?",
    "It's so weird to be like Oh yeah, exactly that.",
    "So as I give him, as I've given direction, I'm going to be sketching as well on these tiny little post.",
    "It notes so that at the end we can see how we land going back and forth between the ideas.",
    "So Logan to start out what we want to do is maybe do.",
    "Just like we're working with a character or a person.",
    "That will be like in the center, so I'm going to give you like a broad overview of kind of the vibe and then we can kind of try to nail in details that easy for you.",
    "Yeah, is it?",
    "Full body character.",
    "Yes, so I think it is so.",
    "The idea is that it's almost going to be like have you seen jaws where they do like a Dolly zoom?",
    "Yeah, so it'll be almost like that effect like visually, so stuff kind of coming in from the edges so it may be a small character in the middle that has this affective dimension of like maybe there in like like Woods or or like a kind of like deep kind of thing.",
    "So the overall focus is like focused into the center of that character in the middle.",
    "Oh yeah, yeah yes yes, yes there's something in this room with us right now also OK, so the girl.",
    "This is a complete Side Story.",
    "The girl from the evil dead remake who is like like the craziest like horror movie of all time that I think she's doing the extraordinary Zoe.",
    "Yeah, and she's like dancing and singing and I was like I know I seen you do some weird stuff.",
    "Again.",
    "In evil dead, she's just like super coffee and Aggro.",
    "And then in Zoe she's just like super bubbly.",
    "And yes, yeah, exactly, she's like I'm fine.",
    "Yes, OK, cool.",
    "So let's maybe, um, let's maybe start with the small character in the middle.",
    "Maybe like maybe we start with doing some perspective stuff and then let's start with a little character.",
    "He is definitely like a little male character, so he is he is.",
    "He doesn't have to be human.",
    "He could be some kind of like a humanoid kind of entity, person, whatever.",
    "Really have to be a human, but something that is like OK, it's relatable as a human.",
    "And he's going to be like we want him to look a little bit younger.",
    "Uhm, an look like he is.",
    "Uhm, maybe in in the middle of something right?",
    "That maybe he's not just like standing like looking stoic.",
    "He's kind of like maybe looking back or he's like looking up at something.",
    "Or like there's I don't know if you shocked he's more like curious.",
    "Really curious, an more like uhm.",
    "Uh, almost like, oh, let's look for what's out there in like, oh, there's like a bold frontier ahead of us.",
    "OK so I'm I'm sketching this down.",
    "As well, just so I can have.",
    "Of course, my pen literally 2 lines in stops working.",
    "Did you get the batteries there?",
    "We go got it.",
    "Oh no.",
    "I'm sitting on like a little.",
    "A little post it note.",
    "OK, cool, that's my favorite.",
    "When the iPad pencil is like sorry batteries at 5 for sound like I was so prepped already.",
    "So a little guy.",
    "And let's say that he's on a path, so maybe he's not just like standing in the void.",
    "Maybe he's on some kind of path that's going somewhere.",
    "And let's say that he.",
    "Coming towards us into the distance.",
    "So the perspective like the thicker of the path is close to us and then maybe it's hitting like going over like a horizon.",
    "OK, so is he.",
    "So he is walking.",
    "He's walking.",
    "Yes, he's he's either like fully turned in looking at us or he was like walking away and like he just turned around to like look at us, OK?",
    "Right, yeah, in the path.",
    "Kind of wide near us and then winding into what would be like a horizon line just so we don't have to like fill all that space.",
    "Yes.",
    "Let's funding not in illustrator.",
    "In thinking like that will make it easy to have a horizon.",
    "It's true it is.",
    "You don't have to draw, the rest is just like and it's Sky.",
    "I do love a lot of illustrations that are forced into minimalism because I feel like often find illustration is just way too complicated.",
    "Yep, which is where that nice like being a designer and illustrator comes into play.",
    "That's true you you so this would be the profile as you work on those year.",
    "A little bit of everything like evening programming a little bit you design a little bit.",
    "You do illustration a little bit you're like all of the above.",
    "Try to be.",
    "We'll see how long that lasts and we start having kids know boy.",
    "Oh boy, I always get so overwhelmed when people like talk about having kids and not just like, Oh yeah, we're going to have a kid like I'm like cool like a kid is cool and then I hear like Oh yeah, we're just having kids and I was like how many like you're just going to start having them and it's just going to keep going indefinitely.",
    "Yeah dude.",
    "We've got the like two to three benchmark set and then, uh.",
    "Forget zone.",
    "2nd kid OK.",
    "I'm adopted the adoption.",
    "OK, so then at the top we want to leave room for some type and when working with like like maybe colors we want to keep it a little more.",
    "Not like coffee but like maybe mysterious.",
    "I should have probably said this in the beginning like more like night, night, night timing.",
    "Yeah, is this figure also dressed in like warm clothes, cold clothes, probably like like like warm clothes like questing close?",
    "I think would be a good yeah.",
    "Does he have like look at?",
    "Yeah yeah yeah like a.",
    "Yeah, like a cool hat.",
    "Looked like a baseball cap but like a hat like a sweet baseball hat or even with sweet baseball hat.",
    "He can get some like nest vibes.",
    "Yeah, baseball added.",
    "There we go alright.",
    "So the Next up and Sam for your reference, my sketching that I'm doing on this notepad will be on my iPad.",
    "My laptop just is not here right now, so it'll be saying both screens are.",
    "So we have our guy.",
    "He's on the path.",
    "We have the horizon.",
    "Let's add in some trees.",
    "And so maybe something that's kind of on the sides.",
    "It's like encroaching in on him kind of thing.",
    "Touches on turn that thing off.",
    "No.",
    "OK.",
    "Off their great, I tend to drag my screen around by accident a lot with my palm.",
    "Oh yes, not a fan.",
    "Alright, so adding in these are more like kind of just textural to create some dimension so that they're like more like foreground trees.",
    "Kind of thing just to show the dimension of like how deep it goes.",
    "Dimension trees dimension trees.",
    "Shut him down.",
    "You'll open up a new dimension.",
    "And then you want to keep me some space at the top open.",
    "Yes, went to get coffee and got some notification that you're alive.",
    "Yes Allison, we're alive.",
    "I'm never live on Friday morning.",
    "This is actually technically in like forbidden hours, but I needed to record it so I have my coffee to actually have two copies.",
    "'cause McDonald's had a deal so.",
    "Hum, hum.",
    "Double ice coffee baby.",
    "Too much coffee.",
    "No.",
    "There was like an app thing.",
    "It was like going over $0.50 and I was like, well, going to buy one.",
    "Why would I not get another one?",
    "$0.50.",
    "And then your later self will be jazzed and upset with you.",
    "Absolutely this guy over caffeinated.",
    "I'm on fire.",
    "Uhm, I would do too.",
    "Maybe some like.",
    "Are you doing like what kind of trees are you doing?",
    "Walking me through like the Bible?",
    "Your trees?",
    "OK cool, are they like fully like like a leafy like Bush trees or they like stick kind of?",
    "It's kind of like brushstroke E pine tree.",
    "OK yeah sure cool OK so.",
    "Do you need how many trees do we have?",
    "Right now it's just the encroaching ones that are kind of like on the sides cool, OK, so let's add, maybe some like Tufts of grass or like little mushrooms along.",
    "Like the side of the path, if we have the dimension going we have like maybe area on the left or right of the path that could make it like grassy or like little mushrooms.",
    "Grassy Knoll and keep in mind.",
    "So we're going to go next is we want to add like little.",
    "Like hidden hidden things on the pathway that are like little eyes or like little like fairy wings or whatever, so these are really just turning into places for those.",
    "So like little Tufts of grass that could be like, oh, there's like a little like set of eyes down there.",
    "Yeah, exactly something sitting on the little toadstool or whatever.",
    "OK, OK.",
    "I'm liking more.",
    "The fact that this is like an esky.",
    "Now how did you give him the baseball cap?",
    "Yeah, yeah, be here.",
    "We give him a baseball bat just like straight up.",
    "Go for it.",
    "OK, cool.",
    "I'm glad we're on the same page.",
    "Yo, yo.",
    "OK, what if we if we make it uhm?",
    "OK, do those things first and then I have an idea about the baseball bat like remind me about the baseball bat.",
    "OK, I'm going to fix this horizon line real quick.",
    "OK cool.",
    "Alright, like a could you say there's maybe like mountain in the background in the horizon line?",
    "I think we should wait on that.",
    "We're going to be putting a title up there that I'll give you in a minute, so there we need space for type and then we can maybe add in under that once we have the type lock down like what else could be kind of on the horizon.",
    "OK, 'cause it might be a good place for some kind of like uhm?",
    "Like creature to be like flying or to show like like another thing that's like in that like a hot air balloon or something creature flying in a hot air balloon or creature flying.",
    "That's a great idea.",
    "OK, so if we have a little accents, I'd say maybe let's start adding some little hidden things.",
    "Even if they're just like floating eyes in the tree, or you know something, sitting on a little mushroom, adding in little elements, I think, could be cool.",
    "Double this guy up so he's.",
    "Get a little bit more line going for him.",
    "And I think we want them to like some of them to be menacing, and some of them to be friendly.",
    "So it's not in all like, oh, yay, it's like Oh, there might be danger.",
    "Wizard of Oz.",
    "But like later on in life, so they've all become individuals and like learn their own lessons.",
    "Yeah, they're like, yeah, they were.",
    "Yeah, there are teenagers and now they've grown up there in college.",
    "They've like discovered themselves and their back.",
    "Yeah.",
    "The type that we're meeting at the top is.",
    "It return to oz.",
    "Now have you seen that movie?",
    "I have, weirdly enough, like maybe more than the actual Wizard of Oz because as a kid I just thought it was like more Tim Burton Y.",
    "Yes Yep, Allison.",
    "By the way Andrew can you tell us how you're liking illustrator for iPad or is it top secret still?",
    "It is still top secret.",
    "I actually just turned in my first project for illustration iPad an it's amazing I love it.",
    "I have been using my iPad so now that I have almost a full suite.",
    "Of illustrator photo shop Adobe comp.",
    "I just wish we had in design on iPad, but almost like I don't use my lap my laptop very much anymore.",
    "I'm pretty much just in my iPad pro and I got the keyboard with like the mouse pad on it.",
    "It's amazing.",
    "I think you still use my laptop the majority of the time, but I think that's just like so I'm comfortable with it right now, yeah?",
    "OK.",
    "Are we ready for our next move?",
    "Can you recap of what you have on your artboard?",
    "Then I'm just going to like visualize it and see if we can.",
    "If we need to make anything.",
    "I have a.",
    "Kind of like pine trees coming in from the left and right.",
    "There's some like bushlike plant things going on in the foreground in the bottom corners.",
    "OK, there is a few creatures starting to pop out and then like a few rolling Hills that aren't super intense that are just like behind him.",
    "OK, with the path, that kind of wines into the rolling Hills.",
    "And then he's like in the middle.",
    "Kind of turning back.",
    "Cool with the baseball hat baseball bat.",
    "OK cool, so with the bat can we add like some magic to it and so put like some like a glow on the end.",
    "Almost if it's like a like a wand or like an enchanted scepter or something that like.",
    "Yeah, right.",
    "Jerk or yeah or maybe yeah, Yep.",
    "Let's do that as I say, maybe I would say yeah, maybe like the bat hasn't like glowing and then like in his other hand is holding like a baseball, that's like an orb.",
    "This is looking for his baseball right now.",
    "Yes, that's it.",
    "Yes, he's looking for the, oh, you know what?",
    "We should put it on.",
    "We should put like a glowing baseball in like a tree and like the foreground so that like he you know what I mean.",
    "Like we can see it but he can't and he's like looking back to like where is it?",
    "And it's like we see it.",
    "Dude freaking punk.",
    "He got punked by Ashton Kutcher in fantasy life.",
    "If at the end of Lord of the rings he was just like you got ponds.",
    "Picture pops out.",
    "All right, uhm, how are we doing?",
    "What are we doing with them color?",
    "Is it already just monotone sketching right now?",
    "Yeah, it's just all sketches right now.",
    "Cool, that's good.",
    "And we move into color.",
    "I'll just kind of interview in tell us a little bit about you so you can plug stuff in and kind of wiggle it.",
    "Real quick solutions of color exactly.",
    "Yeah we like and that is going to fit like really broad kind of solutions.",
    "OK cool we have.",
    "We have all of those elements.",
    "Do you have anything that you're like?",
    "What's going on here?",
    "Or like where we heading with this?",
    "Or do you feel like you're pretty good?",
    "I think I'm pretty good.",
    "I'm gonna put that baseball in real quick, cool.",
    "To really make his life.",
    "Meaningless, it really does.",
    "The context of like oh, we know the secret and you don't is that perspective is really fun.",
    "How to put some?",
    "Oh look, here's the Magic baseball lines.",
    "Here's the Magic baseball that you're looking for.",
    "Sorry they'd.",
    "Number.",
    "Alright, so then at the top.",
    "Is going to be an area for type, the type that we're putting on are the words all alone.",
    "And we want those to be.",
    "Like a mix.",
    "So in my brain it's almost like you know, like tiki letters, kind of like overlap a little bit.",
    "Bing get well not OK so not tiki.",
    "I've actually really bad art direction but the idea of how like those tiki letters to wear like the T will like overlap with like the L you know what I mean like that idea but with more like like stoic San Serif.",
    "OK, so like like blocky letters, but they kind of are interacting with each other.",
    "Yes yeah and so like like we want it strong and even like doing some like rock cracks or something on it.",
    "But something that's like playful but strong OK and are you imagining the like all being on top of alone?",
    "Are they full horizontal next to each other?",
    "They probably would be better to stack them just for the space that we have and then we can make him a little bit.",
    "Yeah they could be bigger that way.",
    "Going to reuse this a that I make yes and I also going to sketch this out and again Sam if you're watching this this will be happening on my iPod so that everyone can see my sketch as well.",
    "I just brought the wrong acquit meant home.",
    "I tried this is take two and so far this one.",
    "Is this one's going great minus our technical difficulties, it's true.",
    "Even with I really like working with this iPod now.",
    "I I really like using fresco on the iPad.",
    "Oh, I need to get into it.",
    "Things going for it and I appreciate that.",
    "Oh yeah, as a as a painter.",
    "Alright, cool.",
    "OK, my schedule is really bad.",
    "That's fine, but I definitely want to put some like stone crack kind of marks on there, even if it doesn't look like stone having like some little edges that have like Oh, it's like cracking.",
    "It was old letters.",
    "I'm just getting to the bottom of this coffee where the like caramel is and everything just taste like caramel.",
    "Are you into that?",
    "You know, I'm undecided like I know that I have to go into another coffee that is going to be more coffee.",
    "So I'm enjoying the sweetness and then I'll go back into like the veterans of coffee.",
    "The two.",
    "I was true just.",
    "Who ground middle ground?",
    "I think I've had.",
    "I woke up early because I couldn't sleep for whatever reason, so I decided to read and have coffee early and hang out with the cats so I might be like a Cup and a half in, yeah?",
    "That feels right should probably have another one.",
    "Let's go all the way.",
    "OK, so let me.",
    "I'm going to look back at the briefest were missing.",
    "Dividends are pretend pretend.",
    "Cool, I actually think that we're doing pretty good here.",
    "Let's go ahead and have you.",
    "Once you're done with that type up there.",
    "Let's have you start doing some coloring and let me know when you're ready for that and I'm just going to start asking questions so that our chat can know a little bit more about you.",
    "Logan, we are.",
    "I think we're pretty much done with our direction.",
    "Let's do one more.",
    "So I'm just going to describe to you what I have and see if you have something similar.",
    "If there's anything missing.",
    "So I have a.",
    "Oh 100% yeah, I'll show you my sketch and then look at your sketch and then I'll tell you what the brief was at the very end, so.",
    "I have a tree's kind of on the outside that are creating some perspective.",
    "Then there is a boy figure on a path.",
    "He has a bat that is magical and a baseball cap.",
    "And then in the tree is like his baseball that he's lost but it has like the magic like flame or whatever coming off of it and let some tests of grass.",
    "Some little mushrooms with like little eyes and people kind of like sitting on those going into the horizon line.",
    "But there's nothing in the horizon right now.",
    "We talked about this maybe maybe we could do like a mountain or something in the horizon to show dimension.",
    "If the type takes up like that spot, that would be too busy.",
    "OK then let's just keep it open.",
    "Yeah, let's just keep it open.",
    "Um?",
    "And I think that's it.",
    "So I think that we did a pretty good job.",
    "Yeah, kind of tracking through.",
    "So yeah, I'm going to ask you questions about you Logan and this is our chance for our chat Dino to get to know you a little bit more as an artist and creative, you guys want to follow along.",
    "You can follow Logan at I believe at Logan Farber on social media.",
    "Yeah, pretty much anywhere that I can think of.",
    "Yeah, and for colors again we want it to be kind of like nighttime magical.",
    "Do you know you're familiar with the Sid Wyler's work?",
    "A think so.",
    "So she has a lot of like magical like Purples and blue kind of tones.",
    "Yeah so like.",
    "Thought of a different.",
    "I was thinking of like Sid Miers, Pirates or whatever.",
    "I just said like Yeah, this is yeah I know yes so like staying in like Blues and Purples and whites and kind of that night time like glowy kind of colours as you start to color things in and then yeah let's ask about you so you help.",
    "I'm sorry I have something in my eye chat.",
    "I think I'm mine is going to explode right?",
    "Got it Oh my goodness alright you are half of clay design.",
    "Right, which is a cool thing that you run.",
    "Tell us a little bit of that.",
    "Tell us more about that.",
    "So my wife Sarah and I started clay design.",
    "We met in San Francisco working at Adobe and decided to start our own agency after we took on some freelance projects and realized.",
    "We could just have a lot of fun collaborating on stuff and so we started this company and now we are 2 1/2 years in and starting to hire people, which is crazy.",
    "Of five now looking to grow to like 6 or 7 in the year, probably um right now or in Asheville, NC.",
    "But we're going to be moving to Seattle very soon to be in a place where we can start raising kids.",
    "And good thing we gave ourselves good PT.",
    "Oh for everyone because now we can travel and right?",
    "We like, have given a lot of good health benefits like RPM right now is out on paternity leave.",
    "Yes now will have paternity leave.",
    "Yeah, that's the greatest thing that I'm learning about running my own business is like, oh like, there's projects that are coming in and stuff.",
    "And then it's like, oh cool, there's money in the business that like if I can set a goal and earn it then like I earn a bonus and it's like injure, that's your money already and I'm like yes, but it was bonus money to me now like it makes you feel better.",
    "So hard to remind me, a lot is like you know the money in our company is our money, right?",
    "Yeah.",
    "You could just take it.",
    "Yes.",
    "I guess so, but we need to give ourselves a paycheck yet.",
    "Yep, and then I feel like I have to earn it.",
    "Yeah, so outside of that you've also got to do a lot of work with mondo.",
    "Try if you aren't familiar.",
    "Mondo is a company that makes collectables.",
    "It used to be just posters and they have moved onto tiki mugs which are to my right.",
    "My posters are to my left.",
    "I am a very much mondo child below me in the garage is a flat file with 137 mondo posters.",
    "I've been collecting for hot minute but you've gotten to do a lot of work with them.",
    "It can you tell us a little bit about?",
    "Sorry, I dropped my pen a little bit about kind of maybe your first project with Mondo and being like, Oh shoot, this is like a big illustration like that's a big deal.",
    "What was your like mindset like?",
    "Yeah, so I2 is a big fan of theirs for a long while and like always followed allow the artist that we're doing stuff on Mondo and I've collected not nearly as many posters as you have.",
    "'cause I just never had space.",
    "The closet to my right is filled with a lot of posters.",
    "So when they just reached out and was like, Oh yeah, we've like followed your stuff for a long while and would love to do something With You.",
    "I was like that's cool.",
    "What did you have in mind like?",
    "Where does my style fit for what you're looking for?",
    "And initially they threw Scott Pilgrim my way.",
    "Which I love.",
    "Scott Pilgrim yes.",
    "I did a lot of sketches that they loads, but when the movie company saw it, apparently like Edgar Wright loved it, but the company itself is like.",
    "These need to look like Michael Cera and stuff.",
    "Oh stylized versions to match with the comic by.",
    "But yeah, so they were like all right.",
    "Well, I think actually this other thing came in, and since we're still working with Edgar like do you want to do?",
    "The Coronado trilogy has like?",
    "Sure, I love those too and that like Edgar was like I already love that your styles wacky and we don't need the weird things like the movie production company because we get to say whatever.",
    "Yep, wacky styles on that.",
    "And they were super into it like pretty immediately.",
    "So yeah, it was like a very fluid fun process.",
    "They're all super cool over there.",
    "I got to hang out with them in San Diego Comic Con in person and like that.",
    "So I wonder if we ever crossed paths at Comic Con.",
    "When were you there?",
    "How is there when like Aqua man was about to come out?",
    "Oh OK, I missed it.",
    "I I'd stopped going and right before that I volunteered for like 7 years and then it was just too much and I was like yeah I can't go anymore.",
    "It's overwhelming.",
    "Yeah, like I think as a kid or not a case, but like early in my career I went to a lot of common conventions because I was in comics.",
    "Yep, so I would like have to travel to promote myself and like it was really fun during that time period.",
    "But now has an old.",
    "I just get really exhausted and I like one day I'm like I'm done with what I need to do here.",
    "Why are there three more days?",
    "Yep.",
    "And I don't really enjoy the whole like having a booth and hustling thing.",
    "I love talking to people, but it's more like can I leave this table and just go chat?",
    "Yeah, so I don't know that lifestyle just got kind of burnt out and it takes a lot of traveling and like it costs a lot to go into those places.",
    "So when I went that year it was just like kind of for fun.",
    "Yes, I get to wander around, just talk to people.",
    "Which is the way to do it.",
    "On your composition, is there any room for us to put like A tag line or anything?",
    "We don't need it.",
    "I just had an idea for it, I think so I'm going to use it with color.",
    "OK, cool.",
    "Cool, so let's do, uhm.",
    "Um?",
    "Let's do.",
    "Let's do a little tag line that says an adventure on your own.",
    "OK.",
    "And my placement is going to look way worse 'cause I actually don't have space for it on my sketch.",
    "And so just know that when you see it, y'all Logans is going to be way better.",
    "What is happening with my pen?",
    "There we go.",
    "Also, we can hear that I live next to an airport and their air porting very aggressively these last few days.",
    "So if you can hear.",
    "I don't know, it's just been these last few days.",
    "They've been kind of stepping it up.",
    "Interesting, I feel like airports wouldn't be as busy because, well, it's like a local airport, so I think that it's like hobbyists that are like we have to go fly somewhere.",
    "Now I gotta get outta here Alright.",
    "And then once we have that added, I think I think that it's the end.",
    "I think we're going to debut and show what's going on.",
    "OK, I'm going to.",
    "Do one more passes this.",
    "I'd like a yellow and put that tag line in their sweet.",
    "Yellow Hello so I am going to go get my laptop from where I left it and then I'm actually heading off to Houston to hang out in Houston for a few days and working on cancelled con.",
    "Let's do this y'all.",
    "If you are not already go to cancelled con at com two else cancelled con RSVP for that it's coming up next Saturday.",
    "It will be a super fun time with a bunch of creative celebrating the spirit of creativity in community.",
    "Online, It's free and open for everyone, so.",
    "Go check that out via parts.",
    "I'm going to lose my mind for the next week until that happens, but it's going to be exciting.",
    "I mean, that's why your double fisting coffees, right?",
    "That is definitely from double fisting copies.",
    "My goodness.",
    "Yes.",
    "Who's in Houston?",
    "My parents.",
    "It's my mom's birthday today, I know.",
    "Oh gosh, she was born in 52, so that's.",
    "58 58 60 eight 6868 Yeah.",
    "68 she's getting up there.",
    "Yes, she is Wise.",
    "She just turned 69.",
    "Oh my parents at their 40 parrot Twins.",
    "How your what 33?",
    "30 one were the exact same age.",
    "What the heck?",
    "How do not know this?",
    "You just seems so much more mature and composed.",
    "Risky and stuff I drink.",
    "Classy that's it.",
    "Alright, I mean, that's cool.",
    "I am happy to be this age.",
    "I feel better now than I have.",
    "I don't know.",
    "I think it's just like I know myself and so that's true.",
    "I feel more confident in life in general.",
    "Like sure my knee pop sometimes.",
    "Oh, I definitely feel like my body is falling apart.",
    "Yeah, my body is falling apart but I'm like, yeah I can like do stuff.",
    "Um color cool and then for recap for our friends in chat before we go into the big reveal.",
    "This is a pilot episode for a show called design in the dark where our friend Logan here does not have the brief of what we're working on.",
    "If you're looking at the screen right now, you can see up above.",
    "That's our brief it Logan does not know that and I have been coaching him through this project without being able to see his screen of the entire time.",
    "So I have a sketch that I've been working on that in the future will be on my iPod and will be sharing the screen.",
    "That I have a sketch it.",
    "I've been working on and then he has been creating the final piece and so we're about to do the big reveal where I show my sketch.",
    "He shows his finished piece and I tell him a little bit about what the brief was to see if we nailed it through our powers of visual collaboration.",
    "Yeah, yeah.",
    "What is the tagline again?",
    "Oh uhm.",
    "An adventure on your own.",
    "Also, my mustache is getting to the point where it's just an sorry, so that can be like kind of just written text like kind of like a friend Francisco Francavilla like it's kind of just like written in.",
    "Not like anything Super Fancy.",
    "That's totally fair.",
    "I'm going to put it.",
    "Down at the bottom.",
    "That's where I have it on my sketch.",
    "You go OK alright, I think I got it alright cool I am going to you.",
    "Um, I'm going to show you my sketch, so I'm going to come over here.",
    "I'm going to change the scene so that we are hidden.",
    "There we go.",
    "And I'm gonna show you my sketch.",
    "So here is my skit.",
    "Is my notepad is literally oh, it's because it's a yellow are doing the yeah the Dragon Ball Z slash makeup tutorial right there, right?",
    "So there is my sketch of the idea.",
    "And again in the future, this will be an iPad, so have color and stuff on it.",
    "So that's the idea Logan.",
    "Do you have any clue as to what the brief was that we got?",
    "So we have three things that you can guess the client, the style and the asset that we created.",
    "What are either of those things.",
    "So is this a thing that already exists in the world that I'm doing a rendition of?",
    "Or is this like a new thing that's been created?",
    "New imaginary client and for those?",
    "Here is our brief for those that need a refresher.",
    "Here's the full brief, so any guesses on the client this style or the asset?",
    "Hum.",
    "It feels like either a poster, a book cover, OK.",
    "Alright then bye bye get from that layout.",
    "OK and what about the style?",
    "Or the aesthetic?",
    "I feel like it's probably like a really heavy kind of like fantasy vibe oil.",
    "Yes, fantasy is the correct answer.",
    "Arcesilaus Fantasy.",
    "We got it and do you have any idea who the client might be?",
    "Is there something broad like a book publisher, or is it like something broadcasting kind of thing?",
    "Yeah, it's OK.",
    "Yeah, I would say like a book publisher.",
    "Alright, let's go ahead and show full screen.",
    "Well I guess everyone else is seen it.",
    "If you want to position I'm going to cut over so that I can see it and let's riville what you have made in our design in the dark.",
    "Oh my gosh, oh, it's so good.",
    "All it's so fun.",
    "Oh that's so good.",
    "Wow that's awesome.",
    "OK So what were some of the things that kind of clued you in?",
    "So I'll give you the full rundown of what the entire brief was.",
    "So our client was a hot new video game that was coming out.",
    "The asset that we made was a box cover which you got a little bit close with the kind of book cover, and I think the sizing's are probably very similar.",
    "And here's the brief that we got.",
    "We are launching a new video game called all alone.",
    "It's a vast open world fantasy game with creatures and characters around every corner.",
    "I spelled characters so wrong in that very flat.",
    "CHARACHTERS, there's extra.",
    "Yeah, we want to capture an idea of mystery.",
    "And so can you talk me through kind of some of the elements that you used here to create the things that we talked about verbally and how it's like.",
    "Oh, it's totally hitting visually what we had talked about.",
    "Yeah, I I serve.",
    "Always start with like the animator pencil so I just can loosely sketch ideas out.",
    "I think I'd be curious to do like a straight into like oil painting kind of vibe in the future at Curiosity, But.",
    "Yeah, just started by sketching that figure in Hadam like kind of twice as big as he is now.",
    "OK.",
    "It's a bit more.",
    "I ended up like shrinking down more and letting the trees kind of like coming more from the sides.",
    "Did that happen when we started talking more about like the mystery in the dimension and stuff you're like?",
    "Oh, I need the scale to be different.",
    "Yeah, when you started talking about like the kind of distance of like the path going into the distance and there being a Horizon Line and then there's going to be like text.",
    "Eventually I was like OO.",
    "I may be made him too big for all this stuff to fit comfortably.",
    "Did not make enough space for like all the fantasy creatures 'cause I feel like there could be a field of grass or things are popping out of the graph.",
    "Yeah, but like maybe with more time.",
    "But I think like all the.",
    "It also has this vibe of Lake Legends of the hidden temple or something.",
    "Oh yeah, stone works.",
    "Sort of.",
    "Also thinking of like adventure.",
    "Books are like Indiana Jones.",
    "Things Sweet Yep.",
    "That's where there any things that I said that like clued you in your like oh I know exactly how to translate that to a visual or things that were just super easy like boom I got it.",
    "Yeah, I think overall there's nothing that like confused me.",
    "The most confusing thing would be like is the figure.",
    "What is the figure doing like?",
    "Are they walking away with their motion house?",
    "All that working, but when it comes to the actual like placement of things, I think I've done enough.",
    "Kind of like poster designs, jacket design, stuff like that.",
    "Putting the pieces in a place that tells a narrative kind of works out.",
    "So as soon as you say something like, oh, it's kind of got like this spooky vibe and it's like night.",
    "Yep, there's a certain like tone that comes from that.",
    "I can easily start being like adjusted to fit.",
    "Yeah, I don't think anything like.",
    "Was particularly confusing or let me down the wrong path suite.",
    "Yeah cool.",
    "And yeah Sam for reference in the actual episode.",
    "This will be the time that we kind of debrief, talk about how to visually communicate and transfer things, will go through like piece by piece, all the stuff that we did.",
    "We just hung time.",
    "So that will be that and then we'll talk about transition into like hey look, we're gonna be back tomorrow to do one more.",
    "What are ways that we could improve our communication so that we could have a better product so that'll be conversation at the end.",
    "And they'll be like come back tomorrow and see another piece as we learn to communicate better and figure things out.",
    "So yeah.",
    "Not the show.",
    "We did it Logan Awesome sweet Yeah Alright well if you're fun cool I'm going to cut this and thanks everybody for watching.",
    "Thank slogan by thanks.",
    "Which one do I push first?",
    "how I ended that one first?",
    "OK cool.",
    "All right, we did.",
    "Thanks, I'm gonna hop on another call.",
    "But this is super fine.",
    "Thank you so much.",
    "Yeah my pleasure.",
    "Hopefully it can become a staple thing, yeah?",
    "More people try to do this stuff.",
    "So yeah, yeah.",
    "And once we get going on like actual show or once removed, whatever will get you on the actual show.",
    "That happens.",
    "OK, sweet cool alright cool talk to you later.",
    "Bye bye.",
