    "I'm.",

    "See how that goes.",
    "Just duplicating with duplicating it by selecting it and then holding option in D and then just moving it.",
    "With my trackpad.",
    "Maybe I can just click with you.",
    "Reflected Again, I have no idea what I'm doing, I'm just keeping this as.",
    "Spontaneous as I can because I think it's just fun.",
    "If you guys get more involved and keep shooting ideas at me and see what I can come up with a nice short period of time I think any of this is going to be really.",
    "Portfolio already, but I don't.",
    "I don't even get this.",
    "You can just have fun with it.",
    "Yeah, about that.",
    "Maybe I can talk with you that.",

    "Aligned in the center.",
    "No.",

    "Yeah.",
    "Because now it's pretty cool.",
    "Moe says yes, good.",
    "Your macaroni looks good.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Some, most as a bunch of us says, this is a democracy taking my head.",
    "What is this veto?",

    "Most says Mr.",
    "Macaroni think maybe Victoria says what colors are you choosing?",
    "That's for you to decide.",
    "Decide on the colours.",
    "Let me know so that says Pokey balls at the end of the macaroni.",
    "Victoria says thing sounds good.",
    "Thank you, yeah most says Pokey Roni.",
    "Maybe yeah, let's try that.",
    "OK, so I think this is going to be the main foundation of my pattern.",
    "I think I'll just make a copy of that, just in case.",
    "I messed up.",
    "It seems kind of likely.",
    "And then I'll just go eat.",
    "So I can use that as my pattern stamp so it's just easily selectable, which is one click.",
    "And then I can keep repeating it, informing factor.",
    "And you can just take the Mandy to keep repeating them as many times as you want.",
    "It seems a little bit right now, so I'll just try and reduce it.",
    "I'm using a 12 by 12 inch artwork so.",
    "I can probably make a square that's two by two.",
    "Yeah, so we get equal divisions of 6.",
    "Or I could just right click and then have my kids pop up so I can just use those accordingly and it's easier for me to kind of great out and.",
    "At everything, even.",
    "If that works or not.",
    "Let me know then again.",
    "It's all in your guys you guys hands, so if you don't like something just let me know.",
    "Priyanka says Hi.",
    "Hi Priyanka Uhm.",

    "I'm glad you guys are supporting each other because I'm not going to be supporting you like bunch of guys said Ibn veto, and this is not a democracy, but.",
    "I'm just getting ready.",
    "It's probably just a losing.",
    "Let me know if you have any other questions because I'm not very good at Grambling.",
    "I lived by this philosophy of speak when spoken to.",
    "And if your schema and forced to talk for an hour straight, that's probably not the best idea or best.",
    "Do you have or not have?",
    "So let me know, keep asking questions.",
    "OK, so I'm just going to move the great to see how it looks so you get the basic idea how that's going to translate into a pattern.",
    "I hope so.",
    "Let's try others.",
    "Most set thing I think I'll need a couple more colors just to see just to make sure it's a lot more vibrant or a lot more fun.",
    "Is macaroni.",
    "I said it just beeping.",
    "So let me know if you guys have any other colors or suggestions for what you would like to see.",
    "Um?",
    "I'm just gonna select it.",
    "And then probably like painted.",
    "But I can't wait for you guys to give me more colors.",
    "Uhm, most says the Saturn is so pretty.",
    "Thank you.",
    "It turned out much better than I thought it was, but then again, I didn't think of anything and this is mostly spontaneous.",
    "Um?",
    "Colours Colours Oh my God, this chat lag so much.",
    "There's about a 5 minute lag, so.",
    "I just have to keep talking just so it doesn't quiet and awkward.",
    "But I'm going to keep looking at the chat.",
    "Well, I think I think I'll use my veto powers for now and.",
    "For what?",
    "So it's black.",
    "Maybe?",
    "Who knows, hopefully.",
    "The colours.",
    "Victoria said your concentration is speaking Oh my God, I hope so.",
    "I hope so and she says this looks so cool already.",
    "I'm glad you think so.",
    "Thank you so much.",
    "Keep the compliments coming and keep the questions coming so I could blush and talk at the same time.",
    "Hum.",
    "Yeah, so OK, let's just let's just go with Bing.",
    "Find movies recommendation.",
    "I mean, I'm in an RGB document, so let's just go crazy with the Argentine.",
    "Unless you like me to go see him like it.",
    "It's all of you guys.",
    "For those of you who don't know, RGB is dollars for the web, so there are a lot more vibrant.",
    "Hum and CMYK is our colors for printing, so not less vibrant because your printer has to be able to print them out.",
    "Hum.",
    "Yeah.",
    "You can just look that up and I know just rambling at the moment.",
    "Let's see.",
    "OK, so we can go with.",
    "OK.",
    "We've done thing and then.",
    "One over there.",
    "Some dark blue?",
    "Yes, let's go without food.",
    "Powder.",
    "Does this work?",
    "I hope it does.",
    "Most.",
    "So the access turquoise.",
    "No, says pink, orange and dark blue enterprise circle sounds amazing.",
    "Let's go with.",
    "I think I might use turquoise for the background.",
    "Hum.",
    "Sentences colors by Halsey.",
    "Yes no.",
    "No down there.",
    "Hum.",
    "OK so face orange and dark blue and turquoise that seems to be the consensus.",
    "So let's go with that.",
    "OK, so.",
    "I think we have to have the Dark Blues.",
    "Over here I just said diaper value and then we can go with it or in.",
    "Hum.",
    "Again, as you guys can probably tell, I love yellow.",
    "Sometimes I'm going to probably.",
    "Orange as close with yellow.",
    "As possible, but but still kind of seem like orange.",
    "How do you guys like the pink?",
    "Is it being OK?",
    "Translator says dark blue and pastel colors.",
    "Maybe next time.",
    "Sure, Rodney says purple purple OK is the pink.",
    "OK, maybe we can change that.",
    "The proper, which is like.",
    "What does everyone else think about that?",
    "Oh, there it says Brown bunch of guys says new Brown thanks.",
    "OK, thank you much.",
    "I I don't like them either.",
    "Hum yes, or slightly darker, actually, probably talk about the blue.",
    "But I've already changed that.",
    "I'm in the future.",
    "OK, so let's just go with.",
    "Video white Keep it 1.",
    "Keep on white.",
    "Um?",
    "OK, let me just.",
    "And then I think if that.",
    "Again, the colours are just probably the.",
    "Are we going to take the longest to figure out?",
    "But then once we just have one, you just repeated continuously and then should be a lot easier and.",
    "We can get the more patterns as you go along.",
    "Hopefully.",
    "I don't know how many I'm going to do, but.",
    "Let's see something orange dark Blue Circle is terrified.",
    "Maybe for the background, I think that can go with the.",
    "He may not be happy with this way.",
    "Maybe I can go for something even more reddish.",
    "So it goes with the yellow, the blue right now I think.",
    "I think that looks a lot better and more harmonious.",
    "I.",
    "Somebody said powerful, so let's go with purple.",
    "I mean, I'll go with the pink and yellow.",
    "And then.",
    "He probably keep that in mind.",
    "OK, awesome, how's it looking?",
    "So different 'cause?",
    "I guess that means I'm really seeing something to interactive by the streamers that we already have on the end.",
    "Uhm, but I'm just trying to test it out.",
    "I think the main barrier is the time difference.",
    "Just you just gotta be patient and kind of, wait for feedback and responses.",
    "Um?",
    "Most aspects of weird things maybe change it to purple.",
    "I'm already in the future, so maybe let's see if you like this.",
    "Hopefully I think you might.",
    "Hum Victoria says yes, change to purple.",
    "I added for both because this is such a clever way to interact with your audience on the stream.",
    "I love it.",
    "So much fun.",
    "Thank you, Victoria.",
    "Thank you so much for having.",
    "Fun and thank you for your compliment.",

    "I'm just going to.",
    "I'm going to keep.",
    "Repeating it.",
    "Just so.",
    "We can move ahead a little bit.",
    "Again, I'm just getting some anti as it goes along.",
    "And then.",
    "I can select all of them.",
    "Move that down.",
    "Make sure within the grid so.",
    "It's still comfortable.",
    "Hum.",
    "OK darling OK.",
    "And then yeah, I can just command the command D.",
    "I'm going to hide for it again.",
    "Wait for you guys to feedback and maybe try out a little turquoise as recommended.",
    "So I'm just gonna.",
    "Make a square described by 12 inches.",

    "In New York, close to my dawn, there's a place called the marker, which is just super cheap, faster.",
    "It's great.",
    "I go there in the winter, it's super convenient and just really nice and really cozy place to set.",
    "So I guess like experience of eating pasta after Mark's really nice and then there's a place in Delhi for picture where you get really really good pasta.",
    "Hum, I'm waiting for.",
    "Everything to be a little OK.",
    "And then before I can order or go there eventually, hopefully.",
    "So I guess what I would answer your question, Victoria asked, you usually have a vision in mind.",
    "Or is it for this?",
    "I have no vision.",
    "I don't know what's happening.",
    "I'm leaving it all on you guys so it's mostly trial by error.",
    "Let me know if you guys like it, let me know what you guys are doing and then we can find this.",
    "Do you have to go from there?",
