    "Hi Craig, I know I've been kind of quiet.",
    "The audio is she on yourself so.",
    "Sorry.",
    "Uhm, OK, so So what are you working on right now exactly?",
    "Working on trying to get the edge for a little bit better.",
    "Right now you're still doubled, though I don't know if you come through.",
    "Skype as well.",
    "Is that better?",
    "There you go, yeah?",
    "OK.",
    "Yeah yeah, I'm just trying to.",
    "I don't know, I just want to get get the edges down so that we can work on the.",
    "The main structure without adding too much detail first, so we want to kind of workout and.",
    "Get the output shape and then we start refining and adding a secondary details.",
    "OK yeah, I uhm were still kind of figuring out the body portion 'cause they thought idea was arms and stuff, right?",
    "That was kind of the idea, Yeah, but I mean it's all subjective change.",
    "Yeah yeah yeah, uhm, but it's like right now.",
    "I like it, I just I feel like.",
    "It's it's missing something, you know, I don't.",
    "I don't know why, but it's it's missing that, you know.",
    "Beatrice alone funeral uhm.",
    "I'm actually going to pull up.",
    "I was doing some.",
    "Some practice pieces on yesterday or the day before and I will show you.",
    "Yeah, it was like.",
    "This hard surface practice so.",
    "Let's see, we pull those up and then we can kind of look for.",
    "I don't know kind of details that we might be interested in.",
    "OK.",
    "Here we go, so it's just like a little webcam.",
    "And I thought it's kind of appropriate.",
    "We're doing a little robot that has a camera so.",
    "Something fancy, but like we got these little.",
    "I don't know this little layered effect.",
    "It could be kind of cool to give it almost like a telescoping book.",
    "Oh, I love that idea.",
    "May that's so good.",
    "Yeah, I just kind of like made like an indent.",
    "I like to know who's doing.",
    "That's way cooler, so I like that a lot.",
    "So yeah, yeah, stuff like that and then this one really doesn't have that much detail.",
    "Actually, this is like a.",
    "A quick like I don't know our builds.",
    "You're so so.",
    "But yeah, just getting stuff like I don't know.",
    "It's got some interesting shapes in it.",
    "We get like this.",
    "I don't know even what you'd call this, but you get a little bit here.",
    "No, I kinda like the yeah yeah.",
    "Make it.",
    "And then yeah, down here this piece.",
    "I kind of like.",
    "I don't know in densities look really good.",
    "The way they're kind of tapered in.",
    "You're better than that.",
    "Those kind of looks I want to.",
    "I want to bring that kind of stuff.",
    "Going to the drug so.",
    "But yeah, that's right, you can try out the.",
    "That layered effect, yeah.",
    "OK.",
    "Hum.",
    "Wanna play play with some pretty garish colors here to kind of sketch out some ideas.",
    "My eyes are broken so like what do you think in terms of the direction of like the the rest of the body like?",
    "How should that go?",
    "Should be more boxy or do you think it should be?",
    "More rounded he can try working.",
    "Some curves in um.",
    "But I still think we want to keep that kind of angular lookin.",
    "But I mean we can like it's.",
    "It's not going to be boxy the whole way through.",
    "Like once we start getting our supportive edges and then it should be really easy to start a building up.",
    "A few curves that kind of smooth things out.",
    "The thing is, is like I kind of liked the I.",
    "I like didn't love the body but I like didn't hate the other body that we made Excel VHS.",
    "I like that too.",
    "Yeah, if you just have the arms coming down yeah other those kind of cool yeah.",
    "So we'll try doing that and see if I like it or not.",
    "'cause this is.",
    "I mean, this is a pretty odd angle, and actually I should just get rid of this stuff too.",
    "I don't know if we're doing ball socket joints or anything like that.",
    "I'll put it back ground well.",
    "No.",
    "Uhm, yeah, I'll try drawing.",
    "She had.",
    "Here.",
    "So I guess.",
    "Before I start telescope in this bad boy and how do we feel about the?",
    "The overall shape of the frontier, the silhouette of it.",
    "I just want to like have you and the design on the screen at the same time so I'm not make some things out.",
    "I don't know if that means anything.",
    "Outside or not, but try to.",
    "I'm doing all sorts of bad things right now.",
    "I'm like the OS for Mac is just I'm just a little not smart.",
    "Uhm, I feel like.",
    "It's like kind of there, but it's not I don't know.",
    "Need something a little bit more right?",
    "Like this, I'd like like.",
    "Something about looking on it head on.",
    "Yeah, I feel like it's like.",
    "It's pretty squad, you know what?",
    "It might not be squad enough.",
    "I think that might be it.",
    "What do you think?",
    "'cause I feel like?",
    "Like it kind of feels like if you took the original hexagon shape right and then like cut apart of it like before, it goes back into that paper thing.",
    "So like we have the two edges on the side then we have the taper.",
    "If you cutoff right before the paper and then you stick the head on and make it longer.",
    "Kind of so it's like.",
    "I know it would be.",
    "It would be like.",
    "Most why I'm not particularly he would draw draw the shape out.",
    "It only is that the recovery room.",
    "Hey Joey, yet we're gonna early stream today.",
    "I prefer their exchange personally.",
    "Sometimes I get tired at night and then just ramble or don't say anything at all.",
    "I'm not a ruler, so please don't get too mad at how badly straight lines are.",
    "So going for the robot yet?",
    "It's a little more work on it today.",
    "And practicing the hard surface stuff.",
    "It kind of has like a big hat.",
    "You know, it's like a big old hat.",
    "That kind of.",
    "You know, so it's like.",
    "I I feel like, at least when I I drew it, I was thinking like this is coming out pretty far.",
    "You know, OK then.",
    "I mean, each looks like shadow.",
    "We need this is all too far.",
    "And you know, again, if you have any ideas while I'm doodling this, like I mean, if you've got any new ideas or.",
    "Better ways to convey things.",
    "I'm years 'cause.",
    "I mean I'm doing sci-fi stuff.",
    "I think says it uses like your fault so.",
    "Let's take partial responsibility for that.",
    "The partial this possibility.",
    "I like did not warm up today really, probably should.",
    "OK, so having.",
    "OK, actually that would be that.",
    "Make things a lot easier.",
    "Having that kind of gap between the main body like the shielding on top.",
    "Yeah Yeah.",
    "'cause I kinda wanted like a little bit of overhang out.",
    "I think you can even see that like right here a little bit, you know?",
    "Yeah, it's not like completely connected.",
    "I like that, yeah.",
    "I could do that.",
    "See about.",
    "So.",
    "What about on the backside?",
    "The backside.",
    "Look what you get today.",
    "I I would not change a thing about that.",
    "I think that's beautiful.",
    "I like Lovely 'cause That's like it.",
    "Do you like it?",
    "When I had my head just made it.",
    "Yeah, I'm pretty.",
    "I'm pretty happy with the back right now.",
    "They look so far I'm so excited.",
    "I wanna like.",
    "No, you gotta texture stuff too.",
    "Did we can do that?",
    "We can we can teach you to texture can be side by side.",
    "Oh, we should do like a you teach me how to texture stream thing.",
    "The student, yeah.",
    "You anatomy on another.",
    "No.",
    "Nothing seems to me that the 2D aspect of texturing 'cause.",
    "Still not amazing at that.",
    "OK.",
    "Me.",
    "Like I love to do more hand drawn stuff on my textures and bring those.",
    "Yeah, yeah, I think that would add like some unique elements.",
    "Your models for sure.",
    "This is still the overhang is still a little bit large, almost the sole sketch of its own.",
    "Hello January, how are you doing?",
    "Say something to bring.",
    "This engine.",
    "Should these like little?",
    "I honestly I don't know, but these are just kind of made like little Lions on the body.",
    "Should these be like?",
    "Something like that's what I saw the masses like little.",
    "Almost like a hot rod with some pipes coming out, you know.",
    "OK, OK, so should they be just on the one side?",
    "Make it like a little bit more asymmetrical so we could do that.",
    "Yeah, and we can play with both.",
    "Yeah.",
    "I thought both would be kinda cool, but I wasn't sure.",
    "But he.",
    "And I think I'm going to get some reference for some guns.",
    "On Yeah Missile launchers, I think that's what they I don't.",
    "I'm not sure what it is.",
    "If it's a missile launcher, it's got it going to have like just one.",
    "Oh, you know what I have potentially been referenced here?",
    "Let me see.",
    "I would love some reference.",
    "Sorry about that.",
    "Did you so good?",
    "Can't find it.",
    "It's OK.",
    "Let me see if I can employ Joey Hey Joey, can you?",
    "If you have the time or her ability, can you look to see if you can find the micro missile launcher from do I could picture that 'cause Doom has this cool little can.",
    "You can look too.",
    "Yeah, I just.",
    "The quick Google did not help me, yeah.",
    "Just like this little thing that pops out of the machine gun, it's basically what you do.",
    "Like a little.",
    "Yeah.",
    "I don't know do enough, so I'm I don't know.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Problem, I don't know why it does it pull it up.",
    "The Googles have let me down.",
    "I will look up missile launcher.",
    "I think that that'll be fine.",
    "I'll look up missile launcher in.",
    "Yahoo.",
    "Why am I thinking of like a boxy version?",
    "Now he's all rounded.",
    "Normal.",
    "The box he wants to shoot.",
    "1000 Mrs hold on.",
    "I'm seeing these in there like all kind of round.",
    "Very.",
    "Launch.",
    "Artillery launcher I've seen enough action movies to find this.",
    "Here with the rocket artillery.",
    "Whole Wikipedia.",
    "Mean.",
    "OK, if you search rocket artillery and go to images, that will give you a bunch of those, those boxy ones.",
    "OK.",
    "Summary Wait, what am I looking for, underwear?",
    "Make my brain.",
    "I got it.",
    " Yo did you do the ones on the trucks though?",
    "My goodness, so scary working.",
    "We kind of like pencils though.",
    "Big Big Blue pencil's.",
    "I don't know.",
    "They look like this number 2 pencil coming is shot out.",
    "Are you so bright?",
    "Is their reason for like missiles to be this garish yellow orange color?",
    "Uh, just you know, freak.",
    "The people out right before they blow up I guess.",
    "Like Oh God, Why did they pick that color scheme?",
    "Running, yeah.",
    "Of course.",
    "Love.",
    "OK, so like but those guys are like you know there's a person like standing right here and he's like this big and this missile launcher is like.",
    "Like this big behind the guy and we're talking about a little tiny robots.",
    "The future, everything its miniaturized, right?",
    "Is that it, yeah.",
    "Big things smaller cool windows that.",
    "Hello Hamid.",
    "How's it going?",
    "OK, so like.",
    "I'm gonna have to move.",
    "I'm gonna have to move this whole whole thing right here now that I'm looking at it 'cause it was like I put the kind of like the missile launcher on the angle, but I thought I could, like maybe make some sort of like.",
    "Little bracket to hold it.",
    "Yeah, so it was kinda like lining up with this bottom edge here, you know, but I don't know if I like that now that I'm looking at it from this.",
    "But this angle looks fine, but the front.",
    "That's important, you know you want it.",
    "So cool, Tamale.",
    "Under so maybe.",
    "What if it comes out of the back?",
    "Just like you have like a little panel or something or like opens up in.",
    "Oh, that could be kind of like a little like a little arm that looked angled arm comes up and aims over the top or something.",
    "Like a little hatch here or something and then yeah.",
    "So.",
    "Shoot lasers.",
    "No, this is fine.",
    "Maybe there needs to be lasers on this instead of little mini missile launchers.",
    "It's like.",
    "I don't know, I I don't know how to make lasers look cool.",
    "I feel like whenever I see I think of like lasers and sci-fi.",
    "I think of like the steak.",
    "It's like I'm no antenna seems you know and there's always like.",
    "You know, uh?",
    "I'm not gonna get it.",
    "Obviously not very good at drawing in tennis apparently, but never know until you try.",
    "Neither here nor there, um.",
    "I just I don't know.",
    "They're always like these rods with like a little.",
    "Singing at the end of the issues, electricity or phases like you.",
    "So I think that anyway, is this a CC TV?",
    "No, it's just, uh, it does look a bit like a CC TV though.",
    "Yes, but I like that, though I like it 'cause we're making a little, um, little flying drone thing.",
    "And.",
    "It definitely has some soaked vibes to it, but actually I like that.",
    "I like it too into.",
    "It's Cute.",
    "I mean, the older designers I don't know I.",
    "I feel like it's it's definitely progressed into Morris ECT.",
    "Kind of looking territory but it's crazy 'cause I love the whole design and then when you drew up the new one like oh this is just so much better.",
    "He's so much better here.",
    "Like I was, I was always kinda like apprehensive with the old one.",
    "It was like man this is really boxy like I don't know how to.",
    "I don't know what I'm doing and I just like Julie.",
    "Figured it out.",
    "Feeling it took me awhile to get there.",
    "Are you eating right now?",
    "Calling me out right now.",
    "Yeah, I thought I was being like this street and stuff.",
    "That's why I don't have a camera I can eat.",
    "Whatever I can.",
    "But you can.",
    "I thought I was getting away with it.",
    "You are not.",
    "Believe.",
    "Whatever, whatever I'm not I would like a sandwich right now.",
    "Goodman, now you have to let us know what are you eating, Chick-fil-A?",
    "Chick-fil-A That sounds pretty good.",
    "I got it.",
    "Got it.",
    "What do you?",
    "What's your order?",
    "I got some macaroni.",
    "Chicken singers.",
    "I was like math.",
    "Secure nothing chicken.",
    "Was like really confused.",
    "Their first checking stuff like the first thing he said.",
    "I was like macaroni from oh so I thought I could be.",
    "I thought I could be sneaky and get away with the macaroni pretty easily.",
    "But I was like I don't have a sandwich.",
    "Might be pushing little.",
    "Yeah, so I wanted the the less noticeable food to eat.",
    "Sorry man, I'm sorry to let you know.",
    "Failed.",
    "Well, you know what I realized I did this on like kind of like the four corners.",
    "It looks like with arms.",
    "Wonder what I was doing, but I like this little like late here.",
    "Z.",
    "The Mauricio Hello from Peru.",
    "Hello from Peru.",
    "What's going?",
    "How's the weather down there?",
    "Who?",
    "Tablet is lagging on me.",
    "Is symmetry is broken?",
    "It's always fun.",
    "Where we gonna go put those wires now and love vent.",
    "I guess we could still put the movies up with about the side maybe.",
    "Like right here?",
    "What do you think like?",
    "Right underneath I don't know.",
    "Figure it out.",
    "Negating.",
    "No.",
    "So.",
    "I was talking with.",
    "Wow.",
    "Someone in basically they were saying that at least with like.",
    "What days notice with like Star Wars like aren't arms like any particular that they kind of are like more organic where they like to come in and then come out again?",
    "You know I don't know if that makes any sense but they like they don't go the opposite way basically like.",
    "Will animal legs are like I don't think of?",
    "The dogs leg or something you know great.",
    "That a little bit.",
    "Hum.",
    "But I'm not sure why.",
    "Something With you for this body if you kind of have been stumped on this for.",
    "I'm not feeling since last last.",
    "Sure, do this.",
    "At the time.",
    "Like the bottom part of the body.",
    "Yeah, with this portion I just.",
    "I feel like it might just be.",
    "I.",
    "Someone like articulate myself, I feel like.",
    "If this was like if we're going to put things like less than a video game which were not, you know this is just having fun stuff, but I'm trying to think of like what would you see and I feel like, um, having these like big Inter kit.",
    "I don't know.",
    "I feel like I've seen a lot more simpler robots when when you when you play video games like that and I'm just not sure.",
    "How complicated I want to make.",
    "This because it's also I feel like when you make when you start like making things a little bit more complicated does take things away from the design, but I feel like there's something missing.",
    "I just don't.",
    "No what?",
    "So like in this like.",
    "Kinda just stuck.",
    "We can't just go crazy with the amount of detail and tone it back if it feels too much or even vice versa like.",
    "Nothing's really set in stone, as we modeled herself.",
    "I know I just.",
    "I know, I think.",
    "I think by itself it looks too much like a security camera for it to like.",
    "Stay like this, but I think with the other body design I feel like.",
    "I'm not sure if I.",
    "Love it.",
    "And so I'm just not sure.",
    "Exactly where to go on it.",
    "I gotta be careful about watching you work.",
    "Something wrong here?",
    "I don't know what it is.",
    "Could look at your.",
    "Which sketch OK.",
    "OK, so you kind of have it.",
    "Straight at the top.",
    "Playing around with the idea of like also angling this house so I was like literally just playing around with that kind of thinking that maybe on the inside we have like an angled kind of like a.",
    "Devil is a inlay.",
    "What was the thing with a webcam?",
    "Remember, oh, like that, uh?",
    "I.",
    "Yes, you mean but.",
    "It'll work better, yeah?",
    "Bevel the insect.",
    "It's not any of those things work.",
    "Yeah yeah, yeah.",
    "So I'm thinking like maybe do something like that.",
    "But then I was.",
    "But what do you thinking 'cause it could go?",
    "Either way you know?",
    "I'm just.",
    "Person I'm didia guy, you know.",
    "I kind of like the straight, personally, um.",
    "But I could like.",
    "I mean, I was originally what I had in mind, but the sketch businesses like straight up and down.",
    "Here you see?",
    "But I don't know what you think.",
    "Well, I kinda have that here on the 3DS.",
    "So I feel like Billy.",
    "Well, I feel dumb.",
    "Not I think the gaps find in terms of like where it's placed, but I think the actual it is I think it's a little too far down, you know, like where it comes like.",
    "Here's the angle.",
    "Here's This this to side angles and.",
    "I think I should be lightly.",
    "It's not gonna be all the way down to here.",
    "It's going to be a little bit over, OK.",
    "Yeah, yes.",
    "And I also think like the thickness, it needs to be a little bit more, uh, we gotta give it two seats instead of a single.",
    "Yeah, I got you.",
    "I got you.",
    "I can add that extra see, yeah.",
    "Alright, I'll work on that thing.",
    "Should pick any begin.",
    "Let the.",
    "I love it.",
    "Uh.",
    "This is.",
    "Let the sickening color.",
    "Say again.",
    "So step one, bring this up a little, right?",
    "Yeah, so a wee bit.",
    "But how we feel?",
    "So you may want to bring up side up to.",
    "Also Hello Oh man.",
    "LA.",
    "I hope I got close with that.",
    "Audio I I, that's what I would have said too so.",
    "Yeah, I don't know how any other way to.",
    "Pronounce that alright.",
    "So I brought that up a bit.",
    "What about the angle to be a shorter?",
    "This whole where where you can you show me with your cursor for your yeah let me hire it displaces.",
    "OK with.",
    "You look at it from straight on that.",
    "I'm.",
    "What angle is that?",
    "Do you have?",
    "Can you like break out your just getting uhm?",
    "Yes.",
    "That's, uh, doing CAD.",
    "You could get measurements for every angle, every length.",
    "It was amazing and I kind of wish they had that of this, but.",
    "I was thinking like I don't know if it does this look like a higher angle 'cause what it looks like to me.",
    "Yours is a little bit more like of adapt downwards angle.",
    "Does that make sense for like for the.",
    "The sketchy I did I think I did a little bit more of A.",
    "Yeah, if you study, did you just send me a little?",
    "Snippet of data.",
    "Of that Laying up in the background and see how it lines up.",
    "This is not even an, this is really.",
    "Bad.",
    "It's like pick one side is not going to be even.",
    "This isn't, I'm not know.",
    "Free D model artists or something.",
    "He's not perfect.",
    "You don't need no precision round here.",
    "Exactly.",
    "Go and save before I lose everything though.",
    "Oh my God.",
    "Yeah, I couldn't do that please.",
    "Yeah, yours is going to look a lot nicer than mine.",
    "I'm just going to say that you got that symmetry going on.",
    "You know, I don't know how to.",
    "I don't know how to do that.",
    "It's never.",
    "Never work for me.",
    "I love the is that a CC TV comment that is so good 'cause I feel like anytime anyone this design is that a CC TV.",
    "I kind of like that about it though.",
    "Like it kind of works.",
    "I do too.",
    "I like it.",
    "Yeah, I'm still stuck on his body.",
    "'cause I'm also thinking of light.",
    "Did you ever play no man Sky yes.",
    "Do you remember those like robots that like kind of survey the area?",
    "Very small form factor, you know, and I would say a similar form factor to what we have going on now.",
    "There wasn't any like extra body to it.",
    "It kind of just looked like a camera floating around.",
    "Yeah, and I liked that.",
    "But I think.",
    "I'm actually gonna look it up again.",
    "I found that I do apologize.",
    "Good.",
    "They were drowned, right?",
    "That's the word.",
    "He looks so cool dude.",
    "Oh my gosh, she like this is like if I could if I could make something like this.",
    "This would be.",
    "It's such a good design.",

    "I wish Oh yeah.",
    "I like the bars.",
    "We gotta get some.",
    "You gotta get some bars in there.",
    "Let's get some bars in there.",
    "Little tail thing like that though.",
    "Oh I like it'll make sense.",
    "Instead of 'cause I just don't, I legitimately don't know what to do for the body and I kind of like the idea of a little bit guide.",
    "I just I also don't like no.",
    "He can.",
    "Anyone else is designs I'm trying.",
    "I am trying to make trying to match all of the things I'm seeing and put it in.",
    "You kind of want to find without blatantly like taking things from other things.",
    "That's the big challenge is.",
    "Yeah, kidding reference and not just.",
    "I feel like.",
    "But then.",
    "Instead.",
    "Such a good.",
    "It's kind of got that hexagon shaped two to it though.",
    "No, I'm looking at it.",
    "Hum.",
    "Mexicans big in sci-fi.",
    "They love their angles.",
    "Nice.",
    "Ingles I like those little guns to really like this design.",
    "You have saying I really like the design.",
    "I just wish my my design, but that's good.",
    "Is that how you do it?",
    "Block out of thin.",
    "So that's what I'm going to do.",
    "Sure.",
    "You want my models to be centered.",
    "We have tempted to pull everything out since his files getting kind of messy with a bunch of stuff we don't have.",
    "We are using.",
    "Yeah, I honestly since I'm not, we're not sure about the arms.",
    "I would just get rid of all of the and then you brought all those in.",
    "Now you feel bad but.",
    "I think I'll just make a new file and pull away.",
    "Oh well, I guess.",
    "Just so I don't, I don't know.",
    "They might come in handy.",
    "She's getting unnecessarily messy right now.",
    "Sit right now, yeah?",
    "Got quite a few layers myself at the moment.",
    "The layers I I really don't need really don't, but it just happens.",
    "And speaking new filed so don't go insane.",
    "So what do you think of like the side profile that I'd even though?",
    "Yeah, yeah.",
    "I think it's facing backwards though.",
    "Why I mean, I like to kind of like that.",
    "Well, I think uh, think about like a plane, right?",
    "She said no judgment, just saying, You know.",
    "Like it?",
    "You're the one who would chemical engineering not be so.",
    "Oh So silly.",
    "I.",
    "Something like that, your Highness.",
    "Perfect.",
    "Traffic hits biking.",
    "I get it, I get it.",
    "What's the matter?",
    "You don't want to be perfectly aerodynamic.",
    "Right I just.",
    "Aw man.",
    "Although if it's more like a reader, I don't know which way they faced Youngs.",
    "I don't even know what I'm doing, they ask.",
    "I thought we lose it.",
    "I just want to look cool.",
    "That's legitimately all I'm trying to do here.",
    "So like I'm not even thinking about aerodynamic.",
    "Thanks.",
    "Me.",
    "Tell you what we can look at it both ways in 3D though.",
    "Breaking out the 3D though.",
    "Lookout.",
    "So look out, watch out ladies and gentlemen.",
    "He's about the 3D.",
    "Now looks like a gun.",
    "Just for a second.",
    "You too.",
    "So good though.",
    "Don't mind the gap.",
    "It's still working practice, but usually people say my mind again.",
    "Don't mind the gap, just trip on in.",
    "Take a risk.",
    "How does that look?",
    "Oh I mean, it's not.",
    "It's not fancy, I mean just like overall shape block out.",
    "Can we make the the bottom somewhere to yes?",
    "Yeah, yeah.",
    "Exactly what I was thinking.",
    "I I like it.",
    "I don't know about you, but I like it.",
    "I do too.",
    "Yeah I like.",
    "I know so we gonna go, no bottom then no no VCR arms.",
    "Well as.",
    "I don't know what.",
    "What do you think like I like the Finn.",
    "Yeah, I do too.",
    "I think by keeping a kind of simple we can.",

    "Oh yeah, whoops.",
    "Can you get rid of?",
    "Yes.",
    "No, I gave you all that crap about the old.",
    "Aerodynamic thin, but I'm pretty sure boat rudders or the other way around, so it's totally valid.",
    "I mean, I I legitimately, I mean it's gonna be like a floating.",
    "Robot, so it's like aerodynamics makes sense.",
    "This isn't going into, but if it's gonna if it like, Oh, but if we had the thin turn and that's how it steers.",
    "Then it would be the other way and that could be kinda dope.",
    "See what I'm saying.",
    "Hold on like if we get this finlike.",
    "She turn maybe I don't know.",
    "Like if it could turn like that as it applies.",
    "'cause you know you have to have some.",
    "I mean again, this was just like it's.",
    "Yeah, we're not making a working machine here, but like you know at the same time working machine.",
    "I think that would make sense.",
    "In the back, but like.",
    "OK, it's it's all form over function here though, so whatever looks coolest.",
    "I I understand where you're coming from and I I I like where your heads at.",
    "I just, uh.",
    "I don't.",
    "I don't know if that's making it more complicated than it needs to.",
    "You know it's just a little a little fun thing.",

    "How do you add?",
    "I don't know, don't ask.",
    "Static image.",
    "No questions.",
    "Like at least in photo shop, you can add like emotion words with static object.",
    "It makes it look like it's moving, but in I don't even know.",
    "You could add motion blur, do a 3D object so that's.",
    "It's like I thought maybe like.",
    "Oh, the bottom level with.",
    "Yeah.",
    "OK, that looks much better.",
    "Doodle man, I'm trying to do this.",
    "I practice this.",
    "This other was kind of messy so I was trying to try to clean it up a little bit.",
    "Make it a little bit more level.",
    "Meaning down a little bit.",
    "But Because it was like kind of thinking.",
    "I don't know if you can see what I was trying to do on here trying to make some like Little Angley.",
    "Single rebates on a box.",
    "Yes.",
    "And that's what this is.",
    "But that's not really complain.",
    "Here.",
    "That said that they are out there.",

    "'cause I, I'm just spouting ideas.",
    "I feel like it's a whole other thing to like.",

    "The top of this and like made it quite are basically so it's still going to have a pretty similar bevel angle.",
    "So what do we need here?",
    "We need a tighter angle.",
    "Like height wise how we feel about?",
    "He said in well like this.",
