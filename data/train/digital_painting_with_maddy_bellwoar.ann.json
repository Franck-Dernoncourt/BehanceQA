    "Hi everybody, good morning.",
    "Good afternoon, good evening, welcome whatever time it is for you.",
    "Thanks for being here.",
    "I hope you're having a good day so far.",
    "We are going to do some landscape painting today.",
    "I just wanted to honestly just wanted to do some fun comfort zone kind of painting.",
    "I love this kind of landscape environment.",
    "I thought it be nice to take a day and just to do something like that.",
    "We do a lot of studies here and a lot of times trying to push outside our comfort zone and try new things.",
    "And yeah, it's also good to have those days where you relax and paint something you really really love.",
    "So I know we all have different tastes.",
    "I don't know if this is.",
    "Everyone's favorite type of topic, but I hope you'll enjoy landscape painting today.",
    "This is a nice Canyon scene with like a River and trees and foliage around the outside.",
    "High-tech girl, how are you?",
    "Can you hear me?",
    "I hope the audio is working but welcome.",
    "So we might have time to do 2 paintings today.",
    "I'm kind of hoping for that, but we'll see how things go.",
    "I have a couple of other landscape photos set aside depending on what we have time for, so.",
    "Yeah, we're going to start with this one.",
    "Hey Brad, it dreamt about cupcakes.",
    "Oh my gosh, did you get to eat them in your dream?",
    "I hope so.",
    "I hope so.",
    "OK good good tech girl.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Just checking just checking.",
    "So if you guys want to paint with me, if you like the reference image and you're interested in doing a study with me, you can find the link below.",
    "The stream in the description there's a link to the original photograph posted by the photographer on Unsplash, and the reference can also be found above the chat.",
    "There's an info tab.",
    "You can also get it there.",
    "Hi Michael, Hi Owen, thank you.",
    "Thank you thank you.",
    "Hey Mandy.",
    "Welcome everybody, yeah yeah tech girl, you can definitely share the sketch in chat.",
    "That's totally fine, so I'm going to make a new canvas.",
    "We're going to put the I'm going to put my reference over here on the other monitor next to chat so I can see you guys and see the picture.",
    "And we'll use pure ref to hold a little thumbnail.",
    "View up here.",
    "So that should be good.",
    "And let's see what size are canvases so the size of the reference image was 1351 by 9:01.",
    "That's not very big.",
    "I'd like to work a little bit larger just because I really like this scene.",
    "Maybe if it comes out great, I'll want to make a print of it or something like that so we can be.",
    "It might be a little optimistic, but hey, why not?",
    "So let's go 4000.",
    "Actually, maybe?",
    "Maybe not.",
    "That much will go 3003 thousand.",
    "Pixels by 2000 pixels that this is really not a great size for making a print.",
    "Let's see if we go to inches.",
    "Put this at 300 DPI really.",
    "You want to take into account.",
    "If you want to make it a print, if you know ahead of time you want to make it a parent, you probably should work in 300 resolution.",
    "Hi everybody, good morning.",
    "Good afternoon, good evening whatever time it is for you.",
    "Thanks for being here.",
    "Hi Fernando Allison, Welcome.",
    "I hope you've had a good day so far.",
    "I hope you've all been well.",
    "If I haven't seen you since last week, I hope you had a good weekend.",
    "We're going to be doing some digital painting today.",
    "As usual, I'm going to be working from this photo as a reference.",
    "I think it's really beautiful.",
    "It's like a little cafe table in Spain, with some dappled lighting coming through these trees.",
    "I really like the pattern of light on the building over here, and the just overall feeling the different colors.",
    "the Blues and pinks and yellows on the wall here.",
    "It's really, really cheerful scene.",
    "Hi Mohammed, high pro, how are you?",
    "I hope you're all doing well.",
    "If you guys are interested in painting along with me or doing a little sketch or whatever, you have time for your always welcome to my reference.",
    "Image is below in the stream description and above the chat.",
    "Also, if you check the info panel it should be there as well so this photo is from Unsplash.",
    "You can find a link to the original post from the photographer below.",
    "The stream.",
    "I'm doing pretty good pro to be honest.",
    "I have a little bit of a sore throat, so today's stream might be a tiny bit shorter than some of the others.",
    "It's still going to be around 3 hours minimum.",
    "Is what I have planned to work on this if I'm feeling good, we might go on or do another painting, but I'm drinking some tea with honey and I have to kind of be careful with my voice a little bit talking so much, but I'm otherwise I'm good.",
    "Um prob hey welcome Hi Kumar.",
    "So again, that's where you can find my references below in the stream description.",
    "You guys are welcome to paint along if you're interested in doing that.",
    "Otherwise, just sit back and relax and enjoy the painting.",
    "I'll try to do a nice job with this one.",
    "I hope it's going to be good.",
    "I really like the reference so.",
    "Hi Dante.",
    "So I'm going to explain my painting process as we go through here.",
    "And if you guys have any questions you can let me know.",
    "I am using pure ref to put the little reference image up here so we can see a thumbnail view of it while we're painting.",
    "My canvas sizes 3000 by 2000 pixels.",
    "If you're curious.",
    "Yes, I'm using a different Cup today.",
    "This is my Starbucks Florida Cup.",
    "Maybe more information than you need, but yeah, so I'm I grew up in Florida.",
    "I've lived in a few different states, but where I spent most of my life was in Florida so.",
    "I don't live there now.",
    "So let's do.",
    "Yeah, let's do 4000 by 2300.",
    "That should be enough.",
    "If we do want to make like a small print.",
    "And let me say this and then we will begin.",
    "So that's my size.",
    "About 4000 by 2000 pixels.",
    "If anybody's interested, I get that question a lot.",
    "So let's see this and then will begin.",
    "I baked them but don't eat them all.",
    "Alright, let me see this.",
    "Let's check out tech girls working on real quick before we start.",
    "All this is very cute.",
    "Did you create this character or is this like an already existing character?",
    "This is a sketch from tech girl in the chat.",
    "Um?",
    "Sketch for his upcoming Commission.",
    "Well, best of luck with that.",
    "And thanks for sharing the work in progress.",
    "OK, so we're going to get started.",
    "I'm going to explain my process as we go through the painting, and if you guys have any questions let me know.",
    "But I will talk about what I'm doing.",
    "Here.",
    "Hi Anthony, Welcome I can read you in the chat.",
    "OK, so.",
    "We're going to start with landscapes.",
    "I like to work back to front, but most of the time I like to start with a little bit of a sketch.",
    "So let's at least sketch stuff in and then will begin with the painting going from Sky and then closer closer and closer to us.",
    "So I like to start with figuring out roughly where the horizon line is.",
    "I think for this composition were looking at basically the bottom third of the canvas.",
    "Maybe I made that too high, but we can move things around easily in photo shop, so I like to put the horizon line on its own layer like this, and then make a new one to paint everything on top of.",
    "Or sketch everything on top of it.",
    "Because you know, in case you put something in front and you want to move that around, it's a lot easier to not have to erase around that original line.",
    "So I like to keep that line on its own layer, and then we go on top.",
    "So we've got some.",
    "I'm going to try to focus on big shape, so this isn't going to be a very fancy looking sketch, it's just trying to figure out shapes and where things are going to go.",
    "So look at the shape of the water trying to break this down into the basic basic form that I see here.",
    "Hi Brock, welcome.",
    "Got the River coming towards us, then the side.",
    "This kind of rocky.",
    "Area here and then.",
    "On top of that, we've got some nice fluffy foliage.",
    "And again, these are really, really rough sketch, but just to think about where things are going to go.",
    "And then we will really figure out the shapes in the painting phase.",
    "Get into making things look nice.",
    "I think my sketches often look like cartoons, which is kind of funny.",
    "Hi Amy.",
    "Well, good luck.",
    "Take girl.",
    "He was or a welcome.",
    "Hope your day is going well.",
    "Hey Machiavelli, good to see you all.",
    "Thanks for coming over.",
    "We're painting a desert scene to start off with today.",
    "If we have the time will do another landscape after this one, but.",
    "Yeah, I love these colors.",
    "And I thought I'd be nice to do something to some pretty relaxing landscapes today.",
    "So we've got these mountains in the back.",
    "Trying to keep them roughly in proportion.",
    "And then on a new layer.",
    "So, so here's something as I go.",
    "Sometimes I will erase out, like for example, if we don't need the horizon line behind here anymore and merge what we have.",
    "Then if you are, if you lower the opacity on this, it's a little easier to draw on top of it.",
    "So for example if I want to draw this tree now over here, if I lower the opacity of that sketch, that portion of the sketch, it makes it a little bit easier for me to see what I'm doing, so I don't know about you guys, but I find it kind of confusing when I've all the dark lines and I'm trying to draw on top of it.",
    "So a lower the opacity of the background and then we can paint this tree or sketch this tree and I can see what I'm doing.",
    "My day is great so far.",
    "You know why I don't wait what happened.",
    "I am very happy to hear good news so please fill me in.",
    "I've almost finished putting together My Portfolio to go to art school.",
    "Whoa, that's exciting.",
    "That's super exciting regularly, Congrats.",
    "I live in the Netherlands so I have this Cup as like little reminder of my past home.",
    "All thank you Susan, I really appreciate that I'm I'm trying to fight it of.- High AC, good to see you again.",
    "Alright, let's get started with the painting.",
    "I'm a little nervous about this one in the sense that it's a complicated one with perspective and a lot going on, but it's a really, really pretty scene, so I hope it's going to be fun regardless of the challenge.",
    "I want to pick a color to use as like a background underpainting because I think that would be nice.",
    "It's a little bit of a sort of traditional art method, but I think would work well in this scene, so I'm going to pick a color that's close to what a lot of traditional artists would use as a like a burnt Sienna underpainting in their work so.",
    "My goal with my digital paintings, especially lately I've explored different styles overtime, but especially lately I'm interested in creating paintings that feel like more like traditional paintings, so I like to use some traditional techniques in my digital work.",
    "So for this one, I think it might be fun to try a slightly different approach.",
    "I hope it's going to be interesting to watch instead of making a detailed sketch ahead of time, I'm going to try to.",
    "Work in shapes, so I'm going to try to block this in and shapes and I'm not going to do a sketch so wish me luck.",
    "I think I'm gonna need it.",
    "Thank you pro, uh, we're going to try to just work in shapes so there's a couple of ways to do this to get nice, clean sharp shapes.",
    "One thing you can do is use the lasso tool.",
    "This is super super handy for this kind of thing, so for example.",
    "I can take the Polygon lasso tool and make a big selection of this whole back wall.",
    "So now that selected, I can use whatever brush I want within their an.",
    "Obviously it's only going to let me paint within the selection so I can start blocking in some color back there.",
    "Hey Emily, how are you good to see you?",
    "And we I'm trying something new here so we'll see how it's going to go.",
    "I'm going to try without a sketch for this one, so when I do traditional gouache painting I don't usually sketch on my paper before I start painting.",
    "I do often usually make a separate set a sketch on a separate piece of paper just to think through the composition a little bit.",
    "So anyway.",
    "Long story short.",
    "In traditional, I feel more comfortable going in without a sketch.",
    "I'm trying to kind of embrace that a little bit in my digital here and see how it goes.",
    "So I'm trying to keep my brush pretty big 'cause I don't want to get into any details yet.",
    "I want to look at the big picture and just block in big patches of color so.",
    "If I don't pick the right color the first time, no problem.",
    "Maybe it'll just be like a happy little accident.",
    "It will make things more interesting, so will just paint over it.",
    "I'm going to try to take the approach of painting over mistakes as much as possible rather than erasing them out.",
    "I mean, I still might do little control Z here in there.",
    "To get a nice fresh align like this, sometimes you just want to get that one perfect brush stroke.",
    "But my point is, when it comes to painting over colors, maybe if I chose the wrong color, I'm going to try to stick to painting over rather than like erasing out.",
    "For example, 'cause that might help give a more traditional kind of feeling to this with layers of different color.",
    "So.",
    "One of the downsides to this kind of style is at the early stages of the painting.",
    "Can be very messy and abstract, which isn't necessarily inherently a problem, but it could be a little discouraging.",
    "If you are having a hard time visualizing where this is going to go from here to the end, sometimes it can be a little discouraging to see it at this stage 'cause it's confusing, but we're going to get there going to get there, so.",
    "Trying to stick to big big big shapes, big patches of color.",
    "It's almost like I'm looking at the reference as if it's.",
    "As if I had took off my glasses and it's just slightly blurry, so that's kind of how I'm trying to visualize this.",
    "So there's one wall down and going to deselect and then make a new selection of the left back wall.",
    "So now I've selected that.",
    "And I'm going to begin with the yellow is trying to find the right color.",
    "Go a little bit darker at the bottom.",
    "That's not it.",
    "Little warmer, maybe loops.",
    "Hope you're all doing well.",
    "Hi Kenny, think what day is today?",
    "Oh it's April 1st right has something to do with that.",
    "It has something to do with that, right?",
    "I almost forgot today is April Fools Day.",
    "Oh Man, I always people always get me I always forget.",
    "At home, San help says, should I start choosing photo shop over illustrator?",
    "It's your birthday today.",
    "Oh my God, I didn't remember or no I I don't think I knew that that April 1st is your birthday or I didn't remember it.",
    "I'm sorry about that.",
    "That's the case, but Happy Birthday Missouri.",
    "I wish I could give you a big hug, but you know, give you an Internet hug.",
    "I hope you have a great birthday.",
    "Hope you get to do something nice for yourself today.",
    "About 7 cups question.",
    "It depends on what kind of Art you want to do or what kind of design you want to do.",
    "What are you looking to do?",
    "Do you want to do a digital painting, digital art, or do you want to do graphic design?",
    "Tell me a little bit more about what kind of Art you want to do.",
    "Because if you want to do painting, digital painting, then photo shop is a good option.",
    "I think the best option.",
    "But if you want to do graphic design web design stuff like that illustrator then both will be handy.",
    "But in that case illustrator might be more handy.",
    "Um?",
    "Hi Roger, welcome, thank you.",
    "Thank you, I hope you're doing well.",
    "Happy birthday virtual hugs.",
    "Yeah all that's so nice Missouri, that's a great idea.",
    "I'm glad you guys are doing that.",
    "Webcam party my sister and my mom were having a little webcam party the other day.",
    "Nice.",
    "All right, so we've got that reshape here.",
    "And now we can bring back the rest of the background now.",
    "Do a higher opacity.",
    "And I think I might merge those layers together.",
    "OK, so.",
    "We've got.",
    "Our composition here.",
    "I think this is roughly what I want.",
    "So will start painting.",
    "I'm going to put the layer on, multiply, lower the opacity.",
    "That way I can.",
    "See through the layer more easily and I will lock the layer so that I don't accidentally paint on it.",
    "Let me turn the Opacity down a little bit more.",
    "That's good.",
    "Will lock the layer so this is just this.",
    "Sketch is just as a guide for me.",
    "I'm going to be painting underneath of it and eventually the sketch won't be needed anymore.",
    "So I like to start with the Sky when it comes to landscape because it's the furthest furthest away it.",
    "Usually it takes up a large portion of the.",
    "Um, the painting and it's also sets the whole mood for the scene, the Sky, the light from the Sky, whatever time of day it is whatever type of whether it is that's going to affect the whole mood of the scene and how colors work in the whole rest of the painting.",
    "So starting off with the Sky is a good way to start getting feeling for that stuff.",
    "So.",
    "Gonna paint nice purple background, I'll just paint everything purple.",
    "This can serve kind of his underpainting for the rest of the rest of the scene.",
    "Spending my birthday, watching you, drawing some peaceful landscape while playing Animal Crossing, living a dream that sounds very relaxing.",
    "I'm glad to hear that I'm glad to hear that Missouri sounds nice.",
    "Hope you enjoy.",
    "So I'm trying to get the right color here.",
    "I'm not color picking from the reference, so it takes me some time to trial and error to get the right color, but I'm using the airbrush to create a gradient from the top of the Sky down.",
    "So we're going more and more towards this.",
    "Whatever this color is like white, almost.",
    "All the way down at the horizon so.",
    "A nice gradient.",
    "OK, I'm going to merge that down.",
    "So basically we have this now is our background and sketch on top of that.",
    "And then we'll make a new layer in between those two and that's where we'll start with like the furthest mountain.",
    "Those of you who are just getting here as usual, you can always find my references linked below if you're interested in doing a little painting of this one with me, I'd definitely be curious to see how we might have some different interpretations of this one.",
    "Hi hanji, lickin well waiting on hold to try and get some better broadband.",
    "Oh OK.",
    "Good idea.",
    "That will definitely help with the whole streaming thing.",
    "Well good luck hanji.",
    "Hey red, it's really good to see you.",
    "Well, welcome.",
    "Welcome welcome.",
    "Abdul Rahman Hi.",
    "Welcome how are you?",
    "Hope you're doing good.",
    "OK, so now we have very very roughly the back wall and the side wall, and I know that there's some perspective issues here.",
    "I think already.",
    "I'm not going to Obsess.",
    "We're going to keep it loose, so let's go to the next stage.",
    "Will be able to fix things as we go.",
    "Test my connection was so bad.",
    "How are you today?",
    "I'm doing good.",
    "I'm doing good.",
    "Thanks for the most part.",
    "I have a little little tiny bit of a sore throat so I drinking tea and yeah, hopefully will see I'm gonna do one painting today and we'll see if I can do more.",
    "I might have to kind of have this be a little bit of a shorter stream, but I'm trying not to get sick.",
    "I don't want to get sick.",
    "Hi PC and I hope you don't mind if I abbreviate your name.",
    "Good to see you.",
    "Thanks for coming over here.",
    "Play Nori in the world, the wisps.",
    "Oh, enjoy today's the day right.",
    "It just came out today.",
    "If I'm remembering, right.",
    "Oh my gosh, I cannot wait.",
    "Hey, if you.",
    "I don't want to interrupt your playthrough, enjoy yourself, but if you do see any good screenshots and if you take any good screenshots, maybe we'll end up painting one of them.",
    "I know the game is super beautiful.",
    "Enjoy.",
    "Enjoy, enjoy.",
    "I really like this blue bounce light on the ground.",
    "You guys see that there's a really, really cool effects on the ground here.",
    "Hide Rado.",
    "Thank you Hun.",
    "Gee, I notice that.",
    "If I'm not streaming, tends to be rough on your voice a little bit with a lot of talking.",
    "Hey Stephanie, it's more to la welcome, but an awesome reference.",
    "Thank you.",
    "You know I have such a weakness for this lighting.",
    "I'll show it up close real quick for you guys.",
    "So pretty such a beautiful mood, the dappled lighting makes me happy, so I'm trying to take a loose, painterly, traditional painting kind of approach here.",
    "So that is what we're starting with.",
    "And just trying to block in colors.",
    "And get get something started.",
    "I didn't make a sketch for this, so that's another experiment I usually do.",
    "But yeah, I felt like trying something new today.",
    "Thank you Emily.",
    "Yeah I will.",
    "I will try to be in tune with how I'm feeling and play if I actually need to.",
    "Will take a break, I promise.",
    "It's me, know hers.",
    "I remember I remember.",
    "I'll try to think about it.",
    "I promise if you wanna play the game Maddie and everyone else, it's mostly free.",
    "It's an Xbox game pass on only one euro for three months, so that is a very good deal.",
    "Yeah, it is very handy.",
    "This technique with using the lasso tool you can.",
    "Yeah, as you said in chat, there's there's a good you can use it for.",
    "Perspective and blocking off areas.",
    "If you're if you need to, if you want to paint something a little bit more with hard edges, it's very, very handy for that.",
    "So now I'm going to merge them together, so I kept the layers separate while it was beginning, but now I'm OK with them being together.",
    "So merge everything.",
    "For me, doing a lot of merging just helps me to commit to my decisions as I paint, and when I do painting where I try to get a little bit more of a traditional feeling, I tend to merge more often for that reason.",
    "Wonderful color, thank you.",
    "It's such a pretty image with beautiful happy colors.",
    "Then the closer mountain, and then probably the foliage and the water.",
    "Ajax and welcome.",
    "Welcome welcome, I hope you're doing good today where painting.",
    "We're starting with this desert Canyon and River landscape and maybe we'll do another landscape after this depending on time, but I really like this scene.",
    "This is like this is a great combination for me because as you guys know I love painting canyons.",
    "I like the colors, those warm colors and then the Purples.",
    "And.",
    "We're going to get a chance to use do do that and then also have a bunch of foliage so it's like all my favorite things.",
    "Hi Allie, welcome.",
    "I am using a tablet.",
    "I have a Wakame Centriq 22 is the model that I have so I'm using the stylus right on the screen.",
    "But there's a tons of different types of tablets out there.",
    "If you're looking to get into digital art for the first time.",
    "I would recommend maybe something.",
    "There are tablets like into a style tablets from welcome that are a little bit less less expensive to 1st jump in, but let me give real quick a link.",
    "In the chat, just in case it's helpful.",
    "Actually I have this link is below in the stream description as well.",
    "There's a link to a resources page with a lot of information, but beyond that I want to share specific link from that.",
    "That group of resources.",
    "This is a blog that does a lot of really nice.",
    "Tablet reviews of tons of different types of tablets, different brands, different styles of tablet.",
    "So check that out.",
    "If you're looking to get in at 2 digital art and looking to get a tablet for first time, there's so many it's really hard for me to give advice on the best tablet for you, because for each person their budget is very different than there can be a lot of little things that can affect which one is probably the best for you, but you'll be able to find it there.",
    "I think if you read through, yeah, no problem.",
    "Your welcome Pilar.",
    "Ellie Barack yeah, no problem.",
    "If you have any specific questions, maybe I can help, but I haven't used a ton of different tablets so I haven't tried them all myself.",
    "OK, so we're going to start with blocking things in now there's a couple of different ways to do this, so if you're going for speed.",
    "You can.",
    "You can choose to make selections rather than painting with A paintbrush.",
    "That's like a really, really fast way to do this.",
    "You can make a selection tracing over your sketch of the area you want to paint in.",
    "Like for example, this mountain in the background.",
    "You can select that whole thing and then take a color pick whatever color you want, and you can kind of fill that in, and that's a very, very quick way to paint that in, but I think I might use brushes because the style I'm going for it isn't going to be so clean it's going to be more like.",
    "Like a traditional painting kind of look.",
    "Ah thanks you guys Rosa Manish.",
    "Good to have you here if you guys have any questions let me know.",
    "So instead of using the lasso tool, which I often use when I'm trying to paint quick, I think I am going to just take my actual paint brush and paint right on here to begin the painting rather than the selection.",
    "So we'll see how that goes.",
    "I want to show a tool really quick that I use often that you might find interesting.",
    "Maybe, maybe not, but it's called underbrush settings.",
    "It's called color dynamics.",
    "I'm a big fan of this, and basically what color dynamics does if you go to your brush palette.",
    "If you click this, if you look at the settings, there are settings of Hue, saturation and brightness jitter, so there's two.",
    "Well, there's a couple ways that I use this, so for example, let me turn this up more so it's more obvious when you make your brush stroke.",
    "Every time that it creates a stamp of your brush, it's going to slightly alter the color based on the Hue, saturation and brightness jitter here.",
    "So you can make it a lot less dramatic.",
    "You can make it something like this.",
    "It's like barely noticeable, but it's still there.",
    "The striping is still there, and this is kind of cool 'cause it gives a lot of little Hue variations and your painting, and it can look like more like traditional oil painting with all those all these tiny little Hue shifts.",
    "There's a lot of ways to use this, but.",
    "Instead of having it applied per tip, you can uncheck this.",
    "And then as you paint, it's going to still apply this variation here.",
    "OK, so I want to try so one thing that I'm going to try to make this a little bit less intimidating because I think this reference could be a little bit intimidating.",
    "There's just so much going on I'm going to try to work from big to small.",
    "Hey Jackson, thank you.",
    "I you know I will just you know, I love this kind of scene.",
    "I'm trying it with no sketch.",
    "We're going to try as if it was gouache painting.",
    "For me.",
    "So I'm working big to small, so I'm going to be blocking in areas based on.",
    "That's principle, so just getting this window in here 'cause it's a pretty big shape in the background.",
    "And what are the next biggest things?",
    "I'm starting to think that I need to do trees next.",
    "Um abdulrahman hello again.",
    "How are you?",
    "I see a big Terra cotta type.",
    "Color back here.",
    "I think it's part of the wall.",
    "I think it's actually on the wall.",
    "I thought at first it was like a plant pot, but it's I think it's actually a pattern on the wall.",
    "I'm trying not to zoom in very much on my reference, so as a result sometimes it's actually a little bit hard to tell what I'm looking at, but the point is, I don't want to get too sucked into details.",
    "It shouldn't really matter what exactly I'm looking at.",
    "The idea is I should be able to look at overall the shape of the object and paint it in just fine even without knowing what it is I should be able to see the shape and recreate something that.",
    "Makes sense.",
    "So that's what I'm trying to do.",
    "So now over here on the right we have some other windows and doors and things, so if we're going to simplify it to me, what I end up seeing is a lot of vertical stripes.",
    "You know, it's not necessarily that we can tell every exact detail of what's happening with every Doran, what exactly?",
    "Exact pattern of the architecture, but I think it's important just to get this striping effect of the doors and Windows first and then we can get more and more precise with like which windows have little bars and gates and things like that.",
    "But for now I'm just going to start with.",
    "Where do I see the big vertical stripes?",
    "Roughly.",
    "And there might be mistakes here.",
    "Oh, thank you, I see, thank you.",
    "That's very nice of you.",
    "I appreciate it.",
    "Yeah, you can download you guys.",
    "Can download some of my brushes below the stream in the description if you're interested.",
    "Some of the brushes that I'm using today are custom ones that I'm working on creating for future set that will be available so not all the brushes that I'm using are available now, but a lot of them are.",
    "So if you want to grab those you can.",
    "If you're looking for some brushes that have.",
    "Painterly, kind of feeling.",
    "One of my favorite places in the picture is this really really bright area on the wall over here on the right.",
    "It's so beautiful right around the window.",
    "This really, really bright Patch and then all the little.",
    "Patches of leaves.",
    "Oh, you're hear all your Disney Princess Hair looks amazing.",
    "You're so sweet.",
    "Thank you.",
    "I'll, I'll take it, thank you, that's very sweet.",
    "I'm happy my hair is getting a little bit longer.",
    "Finally, feels like it's taking awhile.",
    "I know realistically it's going pretty fast, but.",
    "I want it to be long again.",
    "So I'm just painting in the big shape of this splash of light around the window.",
    "I'm not getting into every individual little leaf shape that appears there that's going to come in the future, but right now we're just doing.",
    "We're just doing the big big shape.",
    "Chazzan loading properly, uh, no, I can't see any updated message and mine either.",
    "But instead of applying it for each stamp of the brush, each brush stroke that you make is going to apply the different colour.",
    "So this is kind of a way to give a little bit of a quick variation to your painting without actually having to change the color every brushstroke, so it can be useful in situations like this.",
    "If you look at how this mountain looks in the background.",
    "You know, if I were to come here and just start painting it, making these brush strokes if I have the color dynamics and apply for tipper tip unchecked then every brushstroke that I make here it's giving a slight alteration to the color so it kind of with me doing a little bit less work.",
    "It kind of makes it look more painterly and like I've done more work here like a little bit of an impressionist kind of look to the painting so that's an interesting thing that I didn't know about for a long time that I recently have become obsessed with.",
    "Hi Martin, welcome, thanks for being here Windsor.",
    "I'm doing good thanks.",
    "Hi Anet welcome welcome welcome, good to see you all.",
    "Yeah, if you have any questions let me know, but I'm going to explain my process as we go through here so the early stages of the painting are always going to be.",
    "The Mecias Tan in my opinion, also potentially the most confusing because until you get everything blocked in in at least a basic way, it's a little.",
    "It's kind of confusing to take in the whole painting that's part of the reason I like to get rid of the whitespace as soon as possible, and so that's why I kind of went with the Sky color and just covered the whole background with it.",
    "If you turn the painting into black-and-white, you'll see that gives like a Gray look to the whole canvas.",
    "This is just the value range, the level of light to dark.",
    "The background is more in the in the middle range is actually still pretty late.",
    "I color pic.",
    "It's actually later than I thought, but the idea is it's not pure white.",
    "Background isn't pure white and it's a little bit easier to pick your colors when you don't have a pure white.",
    "It's a little bit easier to do the shading and things like that, so so we're painting now.",
    "Just trying to block in the basic shapes of the Canyon Mountains in the background and I'm leaving color dynamics on the brush so it's.",
    "Choosing all these crazy colors for me, which is kind of fun.",
    "I'm going to go on top of this later and sort of rain it in a little bit and put the brush.",
    "Put some of these colors more like pick them more precisely myself, but it gives such a nice.",
    "First step.",
    "Oh thanks thanks Missouri.",
    "Yeah, it's one thing that I like about using the color dynamics is it brings a little bit of like happy accidents into your work.",
    "A lot of times with digital you have a little bit in my opinion 'cause I do traditional and digital an in digital in a lot of ways you have more control over what you're doing and you can fix mistakes more easily than in a lot of traditional mediums.",
    "So you have a lot of control, but sometimes the negative to that is that.",
    "You get less of those happy accidents like things that you don't expect to happen when you're painting that kind of turn out cool so color dynamics is one way to introduce these.",
    "Like little unexpected surprises into your painting, because it sort of puts some.",
    "Colors into the work that you might not expect and things like that.",
    "I also like playing with adjustment layers and things like that for the same reason is sometimes you get unexpected things happening that I can.",
    "You can find something that you like that you didn't think about before.",
    "Hey Carl, thank you.",
    "Makes the initial block in less flat.",
    "That's so true.",
    "That's so true.",
    "I would always blocking with flat colors and it it's hard to start to see the life in it.",
    "You have to paint for quite awhile.",
    "So this is a way to kind of feel like you can move along that a little bit more easily.",
    "So what I'm doing right now is painting in the foreground here on these rocks on the side of the River, painting those, and there are a lot more muted in color less.",
    "Less vibrant than the background, which is getting that really bright light hitting it, so I definitely want that contrast because I really want the background to like pop out and be really bright and vibrant.",
    "So if we keep this pretty desaturated relatively then that will help the contrast between those to stand out more.",
    "So I'm going to try to be reserved even though I like bright colors.",
    "The colour dynamics are really does make it look like a real painting that's so cool I think so too.",
    "Oh, thank you is fine.",
    "Thank you very much for being here and thanks for the nice comments.",
    "Again, if anybody likes the reference image an you'd like to paint with me, you're welcome to take the image.",
    "At least I know you can read them.",
    "That's so funny so you can hear me respond to you so you know I can see your message.",
    "I wonder what's happening I'm sure you already tried refreshing so I'm not sure.",
    "If you want, you could take a screenshot for me late for later I could.",
    "Send the info to be hands and let them know that there was an issue.",
    "But I don't know if the screenshot will show anything.",
    "If it's basically a blank chat, what you're seeing then?",
    "That's not, then there's not much to see.",
    "Thank you Mohammed.",
    "Thank you.",
    "I so love the late on that wall.",
    "Me too me too.",
    "I'm excited to get into all the little details of it.",
    "I have to kind of use my self control to not go now and start painting all the little leaves and stuff.",
    "Yet I want to make sure that I at least get up.",
    "You know more things in the center of the image is a lot more.",
    "I need to do before I indulge in all the little leaf painting.",
    "I totally agree with you.",
    "And the light comes all the way back up here.",
    "This kind of image, it just makes me want to go on vacation.",
    "That makes me want it to be summer vacation.",
    "Having little drink at this cafe.",
    "Painting seems like this.",
    "I find very relaxing.",
    "New coffee us.",
    "It's actually not that new, but I don't use it as often as my Penguin one, but that would need to be washed.",
    "So instead we're in tropical Florida today.",
    "I guess this fits the mood, doesn't it?",
    "Ohmygosh it has the same colors as my painting that wasn't even on purpose, but I'll take it.",
    "Oh, thank you.",
    "I hope you enjoy the brushes.",
    "There is one in there right now.",
    "The one of the brushes in that brush site is called rectangular texture.",
    "It's a good one to use for stuff like this.",
    "Rock, sandstone walls and different things.",
    "Different things of that nature.",
    "Hi Ryan Maybe someday Disney will produce a story about an art Princess gliding through the Internet, building out.",
    "I feasts of art to the masses.",
    "Hey Ryan, get to see you.",
    "Hey I would watch that.",
    "I would watch that.",
    "Ryan, I'm taking a gouache approach to this one.",
    "That's the idea.",
    "Will see how it's going to work.",
    "But I'm trying to treat this more like my gouache painting.",
    "You guys, it's so silly, but I often think to myself, why do I get these certain results in my?",
    "traditional painting.",
    "I want to get these types of results in my digital painting it.",
    "Anyway, what I'm trying to say is.",
    "I have big differences in my workflow between traditional and digital, and I think that's part of what causes a difference in style.",
    "So I'm going to try painting this as if I was painting it in Gouache and see what happens because I think that will change the results.",
    "Be hands on Mobile is not working as good as desktop.",
    "My videos constantly black and I only get the audio.",
    "The good part is I still get to hear Maddie's lovely voice.",
    "Well, thank you, but I'm sorry to hear that that's happening.",
    "Must be where I live.",
    "I.",
    "Alright, Thanks for the feedback you guys.",
    "So are you also on the Mobil One?",
    "I guess so Jackson.",
    "I can let them know that that's having some problems.",
    "Thanks Ryan.",
    "Ha ha.",
    "This blue is just magic.",
    "OK, so we have one door here.",
    "And then a couple.",
    "I believe windows we're going to be adding a bunch of.",
    "I'm really trying not to get too.",
    "Is that too much detail?",
    "I'm really trying to stick with.",
    "Big stripes of color right now.",
    "Until we go into the next phase.",
    "Kind of hard for me to avoid going in.",
    "Start painting little little tiny things.",
    "I think I went a bit too high with this door that doesn't.",
    "Seem.",
    "Seem right, they might have different Heights and things, but we don't need Giants living here.",
    "I'm on both.",
    "IPad to see you and PC for the invisible chat.",
    "It's below in the stream description or also in the info panel.",
    "You can above the chat, you can find the link to the reference image there, and I know some of you might be busy with other things, but if you do have time to paint and you want to join in, then you're welcome to and you're welcome to post any sketches or paintings that you do in the chat and share with us and this I do.",
    "I do this every Wednesday.",
    "So if today is not a good day for you to join in, but you're interested in doing that in the future, then yeah, I hope to see you next next Wednesday.",
    "Maybe can join in then.",
    "OK, so.",
    "We're still in the early messy phase, but it's starting to get more fun.",
    "Let's move over to the right side of the water, get some of these.",
    "Rocks painted in.",
    "I like to use a brush that is square or rectangular.",
    "You know that has a lot of sharp edges.",
    "I like to use these types of brushes when I'm painting rocks, mountains, buildings, things that have hard edges and that you want to appear more hard.",
    "I think it's a lot easier than using a round brush.",
    "Personally, I know some people are like all about the hard round brush, and that's totally cool, but I like a hard brush for stuff like this.",
    "Feel like it makes it easier.",
    "OK, so I mentioned earlier when I'm painting a landscape I like to work back to front.",
    "So far this things first and then getting closer to us.",
    "But there is kind of an exception sometimes sometimes and for me I think the water here is a little bit of an exception because it's so prominent.",
    "It's such a big part of the image.",
    "It look how big of a space that actually takes up in the picture, so I think I want to paint the water or at least start blocking in the water now.",
    "Even though technically some of the foliage might be further back if we're going to go back to front, but I want to get the water out of the way, or at least start getting something in there for the water first.",
    "So I'm going to do that and then will paint.",
    "The foliage will save my favorite for lasts, 'cause it's definitely my favorite.",
    "I love painting grass and foliage and trees and all that stuff.",
    "I'm going to give it a try, but I'm not sure if were able to post images here.",
    "Hey, I see us you can.",
    "You cannot post an image, but if you post your image anywhere else and then you get an URL, you can put the URL in the chat and then I can look at it.",
    "If it's up to you.",
    "But if you posted it on social media or on like injure or here on, be hands if you post it here anywhere on your profile then you can put the link in chat and then that's how I would be able to see it.",
    "But you're right, I don't think you can just post the picture right in, that's that's true.",
    "Oh, thank you Pilar, thank you.",
    "Yeah, this picture.",
    "This reference gives a really, really good example of atmospheric perspective, so that's the idea that when things get further away from you, they're going to generally be lighter in value.",
    "This is more obvious if we put it in black and white, so less contrast overall.",
    "Much lighter and.",
    "More color of the Sky in the atmosphere is going to affect the mountains, so like the trees are mostly appearing in their real color.",
    "'cause I really close to us.",
    "But these mountains back here there a little bit more hazy and purple so it shows the distance.",
    "And I really, really like this effect in landscape painting 'cause it can give you the feeling that you're there.",
    "So I'm going to make a new layer.",
    "I think underneath.",
    "This one, so I think it makes sense when I'm painting the water to paint underneath of this layer, so we're going to do that and I'm going to try to pick the right colors.",
    "If you look down here.",
    "So for me when I'm trying to decide what colors to use here, I'm looking.",
    "At the bottom left and you can see that the water is almost the same value as the foliage in the bill, and it's only a little bit brighter, so I'm going to color pic from here and use that as a starting point and.",
    "Maybe shift a little bit warmer, but this is a difficult one when it comes to painting water, like in a scene like this, because the water isn't it isn't blue, or it isn't the Aqua kind of color you imagine when you think of water because mostly it's just reflecting everything around it.",
    "This water is basically like a mirror of the environment, so you see some greens from all the plans that we haven't painted in yet.",
    "But they're coming, uh, a lot of greens in the water.",
    "And also.",
    "Reflection of the Sky.",
    "So that was part of the reason when I chose the color for the Sky.",
    "I just painted the entire canvas that color because I also knew that showing through to that color in the water and some other areas was going to be handy.",
    "Oh my thank you, you guys.",
    "Thank you for your dedication.",
    "Thank you for being here.",
    "Despite the tech some tech difficulties.",
    "I'm glad you're here.",
    "And painting along.",
    "Yes, enjoy, hey, if you guys are painting along happy painting, I hope you enjoy this one.",
    "I'm going to try to make a new layer every so often so that we can kind of see the progress of this.",
    "Maybe I do need to make those little higher.",
    "I just want all the doors in a row to seem.",
    "That there.",
    "In proportion coming towards us.",
    "OK.",
    "Cool.",
    "So let's get some windows up here.",
    "Looks like such a nice place to have a coffee and do some sketching.",
    "Today my couch potato dumpling.",
    "I'm moving into the customer support helps me with my tablet.",
    "Oh, I hope you're able to get it resolved really quickly.",
    "Having problems with your.",
    "Tablet is the worst.",
    "It's really the worst.",
    "Kind of stuck not being able to do any any art and you work.",
    "Great idea to try and copy your same painting method.",
    "That should really help and in a way it helps us learn both traditional and digital.",
    "That's cool.",
    "Yeah, it's true.",
    "It's true.",
    "You can apply a lot of the same well.",
    "Of course the fundamental things are the same.",
    "Like you know, composition rules and all those things those are going to be the same no matter your medium, but I find that.",
    "Yeah, I take such a different approach.",
    "With traditional and then I and then I wonder why does it look different?",
    "So there should be something interesting.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Ha, thank you bro.",
    "That's sweet of you.",
    "I think painting older buildings, buildings with more character, historical buildings and those types of places are really, really enjoyable because they have a lot of charm.",
    "And they also for me are little less stressful to paint rather than modern skyscraper or something that's very very.",
    "Clean and geometrical and you know the perspective needs to be really, really perfect to kind of sell it.",
    "I think it's nice to do.",
    "Older buildings, buildings with a lot of character and buildings that if you make a little bit of a miss mark here or there.",
    "Or a little bit of a mistake with some of the perspective.",
    "It's not so noticeable.",
    "It's a if anybody's looking into wanting to get into painting more buildings and scenery and stuff.",
    "I always recommend starting well.",
    "First starting with landscapes that are like just in a natural setting, so maybe without buildings or cars or things like that and just organic shapes, I think those are the most friendly at the beginning.",
    "This is just kind of from my personal experience.",
    "If you find a different thing works for you, that's always fine, of course, but.",
    "I find that going with natural subjects is easier at first because tree shapes you know all those things they can be there can be such a big variety in our brains don't really mind if a tree has a little bit of a weird shape to it or something we're used to seeing those kind of things in nature.",
    "But it's a little bit more obvious with buildings and cars.",
    "If something's not right.",
    "Emily says I was watching a video on how to make your paintings look more traditional, and they suggested painting in one layer, not using undo button like you would in traditional basically.",
    "Yeah, I think that's a good tip.",
    "I think that's a good tip for me.",
    "I don't.",
    "Necessarily feel the need to be like super super strict with those rules, but I am kind of taking a little bit of that idea with what I'm doing here.",
    "I'm just not being like.",
    "Overly strict with it.",
    "I do think that it's nice to be able to use your digital tools for the advantages they give you and sometimes.",
    "In some situations I feel like it's really handy to be able to make that perfect brushstroke.",
    "So.",
    "I'm sticking with a this big square brush for awhile because right now I'm just blocking in the very basic forms and I don't want to get too detailed, so I'm going to stick with this brush even though it doesn't give a very realistic look 'cause it's pretty big and Blockish, but I will will will be able to tone down.",
    "Will be able to choose a different brush for later when we want to do polishing up and stuff like that, but this is like a trick that I learned from a traditional artist.",
    "If anybody is familiar with James Gurney, he's a really amazing.",
    "Painter and he does a lot of traditional work and traditional tutorials on YouTube.",
    "His link to his YouTube and his book is in my resources page below the description if you're interested in finding that you can find it there, but his name is James Gurney, you guys might be familiar with them already, but he does a lot of teaching about color and light.",
    "Has a book on that subject and it's something that he talks about in his YouTube channels a lot or his videos on his YouTube channel.",
    "A lot.",
    "But one of his one of his suggestions was for traditional painters to use the biggest brush they can.",
    "For the longest time that they can, before scaling down to smaller brush an in traditional.",
    "That's a little easier, because if you're using a big brush, yeah, you cannot.",
    "If you're still using that brush, then you can only paint that a certain size.",
    "So kind of restricts you there, but with digital.",
    "It's a lot easier to switch sizes of your brush.",
    "I have my brush.",
    "That make the brush bigger and smaller.",
    "Those are I'm using shortcut keys on my keyboard, so I'm pressing keyboard keys to make my brush bigger and smaller.",
    "There's so many different ways to do this, you can use the buttons on your tablet.",
    "If you have a tablet with buttons on it, you can use.",
    "You can set your stylus.",
    "You can set these two you know.",
    "There's just so many ways to personalize your shortcuts.",
    "So for me I have my shortcuts on my keyboard and I find that a lot of times I even when I'm trying not to go make my brush small.",
    "It's hard because I have such a subconscious habit.",
    "I'm like doing it without thinking, so it's really hard to control that, but I try to keep it in mind.",
    "Don't go too small too soon where still blocking things in and we want to get the big picture.",
    "So one thing that can help with that is not zooming in like I'm trying not to zoom in and I'm trying to keep my whole canvas visible 'cause once you zoom in then you're like going into detail on this one part and forgetting about the rest.",
    "And eventually there can be a time for that, like when you're polishing up at the end.",
    "But early on try to stay zoomed out when you're painting, so that way you're making sure that everything works in.",
    "Respect to each other.",
    "The colours and the values like the darks and lights there.",
    "That they all work together in a way that makes sense and I like to have a little thumbnail version of my reference too, 'cause that helps me keeping them keeping them smaller.",
    "The images smaller helps.",
    "OK, so I think that's an OK start for the water.",
    "I might actually merge these together now.",
    "I like to merge often, but don't feel like you have to do this.",
    "I just.",
    "I find that if I emerge more quickly than I more decisive with my painting, I find it a little bit more fun and it I don't second guess my decisions and try to like go back and change things as much.",
    "Mostly when I'm doing studies, I'll merge pretty often if I'm doing work that I'm really concerned that it comes out very good.",
    "If I'm doing like some client work or something that I'm going to want to want to be able to change things, then maybe I will.",
    "Maybe I will not merge as much, but in studies especially I merge pretty often just so I can kind of keep the flow.",
    "So.",
    "Welcome everyone who's just getting here.",
    "Welcome sharmin.",
    "I hope I'm saying your name right.",
    "Thank you AJ D.",
    "Hey Tanager.",
    "Well, thanks for coming over.",
    "I like how the brush makes me feel like I'm in a poorly rendered game from the 90s, right?",
    "Or like your take your glasses off or something.",
    "Yeah, we'll get there.",
    "Will get there.",
    "OK so I'm going to make a new layer on top of this one.",
    "And.",
    "Let's finally add some foliage so.",
    "I'm going to color pic from this color here.",
    "This is about to my.",
    "I feel like this is about the darkest.",
    "Color in my painting and that's where it is.",
    "So we have a little bit more room to go darker and I think we probably should go a little bit darker and we obviously want to come over here for to get a nice green.",
    "Sometimes in Gouache I really miss being able to have a second try at something.",
    "So in that case, sometimes I will use undo still, but I'm I'm trying to take that advice in a general sense and.",
    "Not use it excessively and to choose to paint over.",
    "It's a really difficult habit to break.",
    "That's the main problem.",
    "It's not that I'm so against it, it's just that my I'm so used to using these keyboard shortcuts.",
    "It's so difficult.",
    "I press them without thinking.",
    "It's almost autopilot, but one thing that I do, I do try to have the mindset of painting on one layer.",
    "I'm actually using multiple layers because I like to be able to look back and see the steps, but I'm painting right now, like right on the layer of my painting.",
    "And I'll probably duplicate this layer in a few minutes and.",
    "You know, just have it for my records.",
    "Go on to the next layer.",
    "So I yeah, I think that's a really good tip.",
    "Always said painting either on one layer or even if you're using multiple layers.",
    "Kind of pretending that you're on one layer.",
    "And when I say pretending you're on one layer, what I mean is, for example, if I'm going to make a new layer here, I can start painting now, but without changing the way that I'm painting at all, just painting freely like I would normally.",
    "But technically my layers above here.",
    "That way you can still kind of look.",
    "You can still kind of turn the layer on and off and check and see if everything is going well before it's officially merged down until you're painting, but you get the stylized stylization benefit of having painted everything.",
    "In one, like in one layer, I think you still get the same benefits from that.",
    "Personally, as long as your.",
    "Kind of, I think is a mindset thing there.",
    "Can I share my window please?",
    "OK, honey says our provider has an offer on.",
    "We have been with them so long.",
    "We can upgrade to ultrafast broadband.",
    "Whoa for less money.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Oh man Hunji Congratz That's so awesome.",
    "Let's see you.",
    "You definitely have to celebrate those wins when they happen.",
    "That's great.",
    "That's really great.",
    "OK, so I'm going to do a little bit of editing of my work here.",
    "I'm going to make a selection of this area on the right.",
    "This these this window let me go to layer new layer via copy or control J so I have this on its own layer now.",
    "Go to edit transform perspective.",
    "I think I'd like to make this bigger.",
    "An apply more perspective to it, I just don't feel like.",
    "I'm really selling the perspective on that.",
    "Wall, so I'm using a bunch of transform tools to try to.",
    "That doesn't look right either.",
    "It's definitely a bit wonky.",
    "It's definitely bit wonky at the moment.",
    "I'm going to move it over.",
    "Make it bigger and I think that little.",
    "I think this is the main problem here.",
    "So before we get too far along.",
    "I can ask him to confirm like five times he like.",
    "It's too good to be true.",
    "For me it's like a nature to use my thumb to undo even when I'm using a normal keyboard.",
    "My thumb still thinks it.",
    "Anything that can reach it undo.",
    "Yeah, I definitely get that feeling my.",
    "Keyboard shortcuts are just so ingrained that I have a really hard time to try any of those challenges where you're not supposed to use a certain thing, like undo or something like that.",
    "I have a really hard time sticking to the challenge because my fingers are just pressing those keys without even thinking.",
    "I would have to disable the shortcut if I really wanted to not use it.",
    "Hi Monir, welcome.",
    "Reads as I try to screenshot from the game I hope you don't mind 'cause I can't remove it.",
    "Posted on the discord.",
    "Oh, let me see.",
    "Boo.",
    "The lighting is so pretty in this game.",
    "This is a screenshot red took in the ori and the blind forest which just came out.",
    "It might be fun to do.",
    "Some painting from this game.",
    "Beautiful glowy lights and things.",
    "All that's very kind of you to be looking out for taking spoiler free.",
    "Screenshots, that's very sweet of you.",
    "Yeah, I think a lot of people are going to play that one, so it's nice to consider.",
    "So I'm going to flip my canvas and I'm going to flip my reference.",
    "So let's start blocking us in.",
    "So one thing that I've noticed in painting a lot of foliage is that in the.",
    "Shadows these greens will often appear more like blue, like a deep green with like more blue, or at least at least less saturated cooler Blues color, blue greens and anytime that you get a green that's being hit by the light, like if there's a plant that has light either shining through or shining on leaves, you'll often get a lot more like yellow green, so that's something to think about.",
    "So I'm going to try not to get too detailed yet, but.",
    "We're going to start getting into a place soon where I'm going to need to choose a different brush if I.",
    "If I want to get.",
    "The texture and the feeling of views in technically you can always just use one brush for the whole painting and just you're going to have to scale it down to smaller size and maybe it'll be a little bit more labor intensive to hand paint all the details rather than using like some kind of foliage brushes or things like that.",
    "There's lots of different ways.",
    "Pens on your.",
    "Your style and your taste, but I found that experimenting with different workflows and different tools.",
    "Is really fun and will help you find your style.",
    "I'm still like doing that too.",
    "I'm experimenting all the time like even this one.",
    "This one is a little bit more.",
    "Is a little bit different I think.",
    "I'm always experimenting and trying to see.",
    "You know what we're going to figure out trying to find and you better workflow.",
    "I guess my biggest goal right now is trying to combine my.",
    "Egg wash.",
    "What I've been learning from doing traditional painting and gouache.",
    "I'm trying to combine what I've learned from that with my digital paintings.",
    "I really love the look of that kind of traditional medium, but I love working in Photoshop and I love all the advantages of digital art so I'm trying to like as much as possible bring.",
    "Bring some of those things into into the digital painting, so I'm working on a brush set right now.",
    "I'm actually using it right now, but it's not ready yet to be like released for everyone to use its.",
    "I'm still like testing and changing some of the brush settings and things, but eventually this brush that will be shared.",
    "There is a brush set below the stream.",
    "In the description there's a free brush set that I used mostly and for a long time up until I've been making this custom one so.",
    "If you are looking for some brushes that are nice to use, I really love a lot of brushes in that set.",
    "Thank you Martin.",
    "I'll save just in case.",
    "I do have just the control S, you know.",
    "I press that a lot.",
    "I don't even think I.",
    "I am thinking about half the time anymore 'cause I kind of got in the habit of doing it, but.",
    "When you change the angle of your stylist, does it change the angle of the brush or is it random?",
    "So there are some settings you can use to.",
    "For that to work, foster.",
    "So if you go to the shape dynamics, I believe the angle jitter.",
    "If you set that to pen tilt then it is going to take into account your angle of your brush.",
    "I find some of those pen tilt settings difficulty use like I kind of like it to just be in the regular regular setting, but you can set this in many different ways, but if you set it to pen tilt then it will do what you're saying, but if you don't set it too.",
    "To pen tilt then.",
    "Then it will.",
    "It will not that it won't affect anything.",
    "So to take a moment and sort of.",
    "Critique my own work here.",
    "I think over here I've lost some of the interesting shapes going on in this in the reference.",
    "I think it's too much of like the same shape, the same height over and over.",
    "So let's try to do something about that.",
    "Make it more interesting.",
    "Maybe this can be a little higher up here and then kind of race out a little bit and make this.",
    "A little lower.",
    "And then have.",
    "In this little tree coming up here with some space in between.",
    "Sometimes when I'm painting I have to fight that little autopilot that happens where you just kind of painting and repeating the same shapes.",
    "This is hopefully going to help me take a fresh look at what I'm doing here and maybe make some adjustments.",
    "If you guys ever start to feel really lost in your painting and you can't.",
    "Figure out what's wrong, but maybe something is bugging you.",
    "It really helps to flip your canvas horizontally.",
    "Then you will kind of trick your brain into.",
    "Reprocessing the image.",
    "So you're going to see it fresh in a new way.",
    "Sometimes after we've been looking at something for awhile, it's hard to.",
    "It's hard to really tell what's going on there.",
    "Some things that.",
    "You think?",
    "We're working.",
    "There might be something off with it and you just can't see it anymore.",
    "So yeah, flipping the image can be really, really handy.",
    "So I'm going to put in tiny bit of these little dashboard lights just so we can figure we can start to think about.",
    "The lighting scenario there, but I definitely want to do more later.",
    "Yeah, season it exactly right.",
    "Not knowing the keyboard shortcuts, would it actually be a benefit in this case?",
    "Because if you were trying to paint traditionally so that way you wouldn't be going on autopilot and clicking away.",
    "It's so hard to turn that of.-.",
    "OK, so I think this is time for me to make a new layer because I want to be able to look back at this process and I think if we don't make a new layer now then we're going to end up having one of those tutorials where you have like one step and then it's like finished in the next step and you're like, wait is like it was.",
    "I supposed to see anything in between there.",
    "So OK will save now will keep going.",
    "From here.",
    "And for me, I also find that it's nice to kind of work around the painting and not spend two too much time in one spot.",
    "So I'm going to try to rap things up with this pink wall over here is getting a lot more attention than the rest of the scene right now, and it is closest to us, so I think it's it's alright to focus in a little bit, but I don't want to get too stuck when we have other areas of the painting that still need.",
    "Our attention quite a lot might be time to flip again to go back to our original.",
    "Oh, the start to finish hashtag yes, although I am really enjoying that hashtag, I have to admit I've there have been a bunch of artists that I found through that that I didn't know before.",
    "Like I'm seeing some amazing art because of it.",
    "Like a lot of those trends kind of introduce you to new artists, the.",
    "What was the other recent ones?",
    "The tune me and all those little things that go around, but this one more than any other one has found like really amazing artists because of it.",
    "Just kind of showing up on my timeline on Twitter, so I'm happy.",
    "But yeah, it's definitely like the most extreme case of of that.",
    "With that classic.",
    "Rest of the owl tutorial.",
    "Super interesting to follow, but it's truly not educational.",
    "Yeah, it's just.",
    "It's only for me.",
    "It's just pure eye candy.",
    "Seem like these beautiful artworks, but it's definitely not.",
    "We need a little bit.",
    "We need a few more steps in there to really learn something.",
    "Something.",
    "One thing that it does show is just that a lot of beautiful, beautiful artworks of humble beginnings, which can be an encouraging thing.",
    "To see.",
    "OK.",
    "I will move along back to.",
    "This wall over here and I don't necessarily like what I did with this shadow in the center, so I'm going to take that away.",
    "Will try again.",
    "So new layer.",
    "There's a few.",
    "I don't know why it happens, but.",
    "It does sometimes.",
    "OK.",
    "Same thing over here.",
    "I think we can go a little bit more.",
    "Brave with some of these shapes, this one can come up higher.",
    "Alright, so now that we're painting in some of the green, another thing I'm noticing is we need to go a little bit darker on the rocks below there, so you could either paint right on this layer if you're feeling really brave, or you can make a new layer in between the two paint there.",
    "I'm just going to pay right on the layer and hope for the best.",
    "I, Richard said working in regular water cooler this morning, but after what you just said, I switched from a #6 Sable round to number 10.",
    "Really let me check it out.",
    "Oh, this is awesome.",
    "Yeah, I hope you don't mind if I show the image on the screen here.",
    "Beautiful.",
    "Yeah, I hope that idea helps.",
    "The idea of working with a larger brush for longer.",
    "I've personally found that really helpful.",
    "Kenny says, here's a Commission I recently completed.",
    "Um Oh I.",
    "I think Kenny.",
    "I think you need to upload that somewhere and then put the URL in chat.",
    "'cause it looks like it just taking the file from your PC but there's not currently away to upload images into the directly into the chat, but if you post that to your be hands or like social media or post it to imgur or something like that then you can take that link and post it in the chat.",
    "But I'm sorry were not able to see your link.",
    "But hey, I'm glad you're I'm glad you're enjoying your.",
    "Your painting makes me happy.",
    "I want to get into digital painting, but I'm not sure where to start.",
    "Any tips?",
    "Sure, I actually have a link below the stream in the description.",
    "I'll post the link in chat too for anyone in case it's not showing up or anything like that, but.",
    "This is our resource page I've just been collecting over the past six 6 1/2 years that I've been doing digital art since I first got involved in it and.",
    "Things that helped me along the way an I add to it all the time when I find a new resources that I think are useful.",
    "There's some guides on tablets, so there's some software and hardware information on there, and there's a lot of tutorials for like YouTube and so there's some free and some paid resources on there, so you gotta browse through it and see what you're looking for.",
    "Oh I'm sorry, faster, I can tell you the abbreviated version of the answer.",
    "Though.",
    "Long story short, you can turn your angle jitter under shape dynamics.",
    "You can turn your angle jitter onto pen.",
    "I know, I'm sorry under pen tilt, if you do that then it will do what you're saying with the tilt.",
    "If you don't then it will.",
    "It will not.",
    "So it's a specific.",
    "It's a specific setting to make that happen, but it is possible.",
    "You're welcome, Julian.",
    "If you along the way, if you run into any specific questions, you're welcome to come by my streams and ask anytime, but that has a lot of like general info that I hope will help.",
    "Right, so we're adding some darker shadows here and there's random rocks and things.",
    "Some are bigger than the others, so it's nice to use the.",
    "The rectangle brush.",
    "Always find difficulties in grass and stone ground surface.",
    "Yeah, I find Stonean Rock really difficult to paint, so I understand on that one.",
    "But hey, that's part of the reason I'm doing these photo studies as I think they do help.",
    "So we just gotta keep practicing.",
    "There we go.",
    "OK, I'm able to see this link now.",
    "Kenny, thank you.",
    "This is Kenny's work and chat.",
    "Interesting shadows here of.",
    "Little balconies that extend out from the wall.",
    "So I I do kind of want to at least start getting some of these shadows in.",
    "But I'm not sure exactly.",
    "Uh.",
    "What's the best way to simplify these shapes?",
    "I want to give for the viewer the impression.",
    "Of what's here, but without so specifically, drawing every little detail of it.",
    "So I'm trying to figure out how to do that with shapes, blocks of color.",
    "Just kind of putting the right shapes roughly in the right place.",
    "About a ton of precision of the detail, I think we can still give the idea.",
    "OK, up here the.",
    "The blue.",
    "Wall has a light shining on it too, so we've got really bright white and then coming up right next to it on the left.",
    "We've got the.",
    "The yellow, so it's.",
    "Nice contrast.",
    "I'm looking forward to painting in the.",
    "Plants.",
    "I think that would be my next thing.",
    "I might pop in a little bit more of this, warm, almost hot orange color.",
    "I really, really like it.",
    "Anubhav, hi welcome.",
    "For you.",
    "So it might be good to turn my painting into black-and-white, turn the reference into black and white, and have a look.",
    "This definitely helps.",
    "Look at that.",
    "I mean my painting is in the early stages, but we really get a feeling of what's missing.",
    "So as the scene gets further away from us, this whole area is quite a bit darker.",
    "The trees are darker, but this whole area is more in Shadow and then over here, generally lighter.",
    "So we need to boost up the lighting in the area closer to us.",
    "An overall dark in the area down further.",
    "Hey, I'm above I.",
    "Sadly I don't know how to do that, um.",
    "I do have an artist that I know who does that type of Art.",
    "I wonder if I can find.",
    "Them really quick.",
    "To give you a recommendation, 'cause I think he has some videos on YouTube.",
    "I don't do movie posters but give me 1 second.",
    "Let me see if I can find the artist name to recommend to you who might be able to give you some good.",
    "Good info on that.",
    "Trying to remember their account off the top of my head.",
    "Alright, hold on I think I got it.",
    "Yeah, he's really good.",
    "Let me give you a link.",
    "He only has a couple YouTube videos.",
    "I thought he had more.",
    "I know this artist from Instagram.",
    "I'm still going to post the link in the chat.",
    "Um?",
    "I'll post the link to his.",
    "Instagram too, I'm really amazed by his work.",
    "He does photo bashing.",
    "Um?",
    "Photo bashing multiple images together to create things that would definitely appear to be movie poster type of artwork.",
    "And he's a lot of his Instagram posts show behind the scenes and process things and stuff like that.",
    "So process and a lot of these are movie poster style artworks.",
    "And for a lot of them you can see the behind the scenes like the pieces that came together.",
    "To create the image.",
    "So I hope it helps a little bit.",
    "Sorry, I don't know more about it myself.",
    "How many hours a day to practice to keep your skills sharp?",
    "Really nice work.",
    "I like the textures a lot of very traditional feeling textures going on in here too.",
    "Hey Jesper, welcome it is relatively knew so.",
    "Open.",
    "A lot of fun.",
    "Find digital painting more enjoyable.",
    "When I'm not trying too hard and let the brush flow, I really relate to that.",
    "I really relate to that.",
    "It's hard sometimes to let go.",
    "You know 'cause you want to make good work.",
    "Everyone wants to make good work, but I do think that my most enjoyable painting sessions have come from when I'm just kind of relaxed and not worried about how things turn out.",
    "I think for me the biggest thing was.",
    "Starting to do studies that I had no plans on posting on social media, like doing some studies just for yourself just for your own enjoyment and not thinking.",
    "Oh this has to be really good because I'm going to share it or this has to be really good.",
    "'cause I'm going to make a print of it.",
    "You know, just having fun with the art.",
    "Just having fun with the study and being open to the fact that this might just be an hour or two study that I never look at again.",
    "I have done a lot of those over the past couple of years that I never did before.",
    "So so for some of you this might be old news.",
    "But for me I used to put a lot of effort into every single painting, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I wouldn't do any studies.",
    "I was only making paintings and spending a lot of time on the paintings.",
    "I wasn't making mixing in any quick studies, and when I started doing that, it changed everything.",
    "It really got me to relax more with my art, knowing that not everything that I've painted was going to be.",
    "Perfect and letting myself make mistakes in those studies.",
    "Took a lot of the pressure off so.",
    "I definitely.",
    "It definitely encourage everyone to do some studies.",
    "Do some photo studies or some experiments where you really just relax and don't worry about the results so much.",
    "OK, so here let's go over what layers I have real quick.",
    "We've got the background.",
    "Which is just this gradient that we painted with the.",
    "Um?",
    "Airbrush then we have this layer which is the water and the rocks and mountains and then this layer which is the beginning of the foliage.",
    "But it's still pretty abstract.",
    "On top of that is is the sketch which eventually we won't need anymore, but we still need.",
    "Still need it right now.",
    "This is.",
    "Men DG brush.",
    "That's Cute.",
    "That's really cool.",
    "This is one thing that I like about.",
    "Uhm, this is from Sathish in the in the chat.",
    "This is one thing I like about using digital format instead of or as an alternate to printed books.",
    "You can have these little animations that really bring things alive.",
    "I think that's cool.",
    "I think that's really something.",
    "Even just a little bit, just the snow coming down.",
    "I like that.",
    "OK, let's.",
    "Get this tree blocked in.",
    "I'm going to use the same brush just a little bit smaller.",
    "And you know, maybe I should change my brush up.",
    "I want to be able to get a point at the end of these branches, so let's do that.",
    "Let's change to a brush that.",
    "Let me get a more.",
    "More point the end.",
    "So in the reference you can see the branches kind of curve in out and around.",
    "From Scotland welcome, thanks for being here.",
    "I've been to Scotland one time and it was so beautiful.",
    "I've been wanting to go back.",
    "I was Super Lucky I went there and family vacation.",
    "And we had a great weather the whole time.",
    "It was Super Sunny and beautiful.",
    "And.",
    "Yeah, I, uh people, the locals kept telling me like, Oh, you're so lucky to have this weather.",
    "Now I live in the Netherlands, so I'm also used to a lot of rain.",
    "Originally from the US.",
    "Alright, so I'm just painting in the branches I I've always liked to do the branches 1st and then add the.",
    "Well for me it I stream four days a week.",
    "I stream here and be hands on Wednesdays, but I also stream on Twitch on some other days so.",
    "I street, so I'm doing are at least four days a week minimum.",
    "And I like to do it more, but it depends from week to week if I'm busy with other things because I also have other aspects of my business that I have to do that aren't.",
    "I'm not actually creating art, but rather like packing and shipping things and doing little things like that so I'm not able to make art every day even though I would love to paint every day.",
    "Some days I don't.",
    "Um?",
    "But yeah, it's a minimum of four and as much as Seven that happens on occasion where I draw everyday.",
    "But how many hours a day when I stream, it's generally between.",
    "Four and Seven hours.",
    "A stream on non stream days.",
    "I might paint a couple hours.",
    "Hi, some earth welcome.",
    "Alright, let me check this out.",
    "New BOF.",
    "Do poster work here and be hands also.",
    "Cool stuff.",
    "I like this one.",
    "This one looks definitely looks like a movie poster.",
    "I wanted to know how to monetize our passion and create income as a designer.",
    "Well, there's a lot of different ways to go about that.",
    "You can take commissions, Commission work from clients.",
    "That's one way to make money as an artist and creator.",
    "You can create.",
    "Tutorials sharing your process and sell the tutorials.",
    "You can make prints of your work depending on what kind of Art you make.",
    "I know this might be a little bit different in design, I'm not sure.",
    "It kind of depends, but some art styles work very well for prints and artwork that people like to hang on their walls so.",
    "You know making your prints prints available is something you can do.",
    "People come up with a lot of unique, niche ways of making a living as an artist.",
    "I've noticed different kinds of merchandise and different things.",
    "I guess one thing to do is keep an open mind.",
    "There might be something that you think of doing that doesn't even exist yet.",
    "There's a little bit of a good drain pipe that comes down over here.",
    "So if anybody is just arriving at the stream, I want to let you know what we're up to.",
    "I'm doing a study of the photo that you see above here at a small size.",
    "An I'm trying to take a traditional painting approach to it, even though I'm using photo shop.",
    "Using some textured brushes and trying to think about this as if it was traditional paint and I'm hoping that that's going to give a certain type of feeling through the work.",
    "But it's a little bit of an experiment.",
    "But if you guys would like to join me, all the studies that I do here on be hands every Wednesday when I stream here I always share my reference image.",
    "So if you are interested in joining me with a little painting or sketch or whatever, you have time time for you can grab the reference image.",
    "It's below the stream in the description panel and it's also in the info and info panel above the chat, so that's where you can find the reference and.",
    "You're welcome to paint or sketch along, and you can always share what you do with the image in the chat.",
    "Would be interested to see.",
    "There's usually a few people painting along, and it's fun to see what different artstyle interpretations are.",
    "Oh, thank you.",
    "Sure, I'll post my Instagram in the chat.",
    "Thanks for asking.",
    "So I actually have two Instagram accounts.",
    "Sorry for being complicated, it's up to you which one you'd like to follow.",
    "I have one for my traditional art and one for my digital art.",
    "I assume you guys are probably.",
    "Maybe more interested in digital arts.",
    "Because you're watching digital art stream, but a lot of artists are into both.",
    "The leaves, 'cause I find that it helps too.",
    "Give me an idea where to concentrate the leaves, you know.",
    "If I don't have, it's like drawing a person and kind of sorting out the skeleton first or the anatomy first before adding clothes on top.",
    "You know it really helps you to know what you're doing.",
    "I like painting dark on dark backgrounds.",
    "Oh cool, so first of all, your work is awesome, but you're saying You started this.",
    "On a black background, like maybe something of this color was like the background.",
    "Nicely done.",
    "Oh yeah, I'm curious.",
    "Curious, oh, I see at the bottom I see at the bottom so you started with the blue yeah, rather than a than a white white background.",
    "I hope I'm understanding that correctly, but nice work.",
    "Really nice work.",
    "A related link projects here, not just inspiration, not my personal projects.",
    "I prefer if people are sharing art that it's their own work.",
    "You guys are.",
    "Yeah, I would prefer that.",
    "I have a discord community for anybody that doesn't know, there's a share inspiration channel in the discord.",
    "If you want to share stuff there, that's awesome, but if you're sharing here, I would prefer to be your own work that you have.",
    "Yeah, just to make sure everyone has permissions for what they're sharing.",
    "OK, so we've got our tree.",
    "I'm going to make a new layer and start painting some of the.",
    "Leaves and stuff on top of the tree.",
    "First, had the Sky is the background, but the last two are on darks cool.",
    "Yeah I used.",
    "I did kind of the same thing.",
    "This one is all Sky background and then.",
    "Going on top.",
    "Thanks Jesper.",
    "I'm going to color pic from the.",
    "The tree 3 branch that's a nice dark.",
    "Green Brown color and use that to bring a couple textures now.",
    "So here's the brush I'm using right now.",
    "This is another brush I made that I'm working on tweaking, but I like it.",
    "It it gives a little bit of a look of dry brushing like I I like to use a flat.",
    "Hum.",
    "Flat brush when I paint in Gouache and for foliage and stuff I like to.",
    "Have the brush a little bit more dry and this is supposed to imitate that kind of texture.",
    "So we'll try to try to do that up here too, so I'm looking at the reference to to give me some idea of how dense the leaves should be, and we want to keep it pretty area up here.",
    "I think down here the foliage is a little bit more dense, but up here in the tree we've got a lot of space in between the leaves, and it's pretty pretty late in area, so I think I will probably either erase out or paint the Sky back in between, but they'll probably be a little bit of back and forth until I get the texture that I like.",
    "But Yeah, I'm a big fan of this look.",
    "Painting a little bit more more loose and the idea that hopefully this is going to look.",
    "Hopefully will look like leaves or give the impression of leaves and branches, but I'm not painting any individual.",
    "Any individual leaves.",
    "Just something that from a distance will look like that I hope.",
    "And you can take a different brush with a different texture an erase out that can create a cool look.",
    "And again, with the happy accidents, this can be a way that you might use a brush that you don't know how the texture will react with the other brush.",
    "So using a different texture to erase out that can make some cool effects.",
    "Also, I like to flip my canvas.",
    "I haven't been doing it a lot this.",
    "Stream yet, but I really should be doing it more.",
    "Flipping the canvas aurizon to Lee is a nice way to get like a fresh look at your image and sometimes it will point out to you if things are a little wonky, but it looks OK so far.",
    "Brush that's a little bit harder shapes.",
    "So if you want to check out my.",
    "If you want to check out my traditional paintings, I'm going to also post that one next and you can.",
    "Check it out if you're interested.",
    "OK, I'm going to flip my reference up here too.",
    "I finished my Witcher scene from yesterday.",
    "Nice, I didn't get a chance to finish mine yet, but I'm definitely going to.",
    "I actually wanted to work on it this morning, but I had a huge glare.",
    "Look at these windows.",
    "I had a huge glare on my monitor this morning.",
    "Early in the day.",
    "It's really hard for me to do digital art.",
    "I would need to move my.",
    "I would need to move my angle of my desk, but basically I wanted to work on my painting and I couldn't even do it because of this huge glare.",
    "So anyway, if you want to share it, you're welcome to.",
    "I would love to.",
    "I would love to see it.",
    "Thank you bro.",
    "Sisanda high.",
    "Yeah, 100 mils couldn't make it today.",
    "He's OK but.",
    "Something came up.",
    "He might not be at streams for a few days.",
    "For some IRL things.",
    "But he's OK.",
    "Alright, so I'm just going to do a little bit more, will little bit more work on the windows.",
    "And then I will be.",
    "Putting in some plants finally, which I'm super excited about.",
    "OK, so up to this point, I've been taking a very traditional approach to this painting.",
    "I haven't been using a lot of layer blending modes or anything.",
    "I've been sticking mostly to just a normal layer and painting on there with my paintbrush, but.",
    "Earlier when we did a little bit of a value check, I noticed that my painting it wasn't nearly dark enough in a distance and it still has that problem.",
    "'cause I haven't really addressed it yet, so I'm going to show you some ways of fixing this problem and I hope it might be interesting.",
    "So OK, if I turn my painting into black and white and the reference into black-and-white, you'll see my issue.",
    "I think.",
    "Do you see how the foreground in my painting the area closer to us, closer to the table in the windows?",
    "Needs to be brighter and then the further area with the trees and everything will.",
    "The trees aren't there yet, but that area needs to be darker so we've already painted quite a bit of stuff.",
    "So I want to try to edit what I have there a little bit rather than like painting over everything completely.",
    "So we can do some layer blending modes for that before we go into that, I just want to show you really quick how I turned my painting into black and white.",
    "In case you don't know how to do that, there's a couple of ways you can do it, and it's really helpful for being able to see if your painting is going well with the shading, the darks and lights to see if the values are going well, because sometimes when you have all these bright colors it's hard to get a grip on the shading.",
    "It can create some weird optical illusions and it's hard to tell, so if you go to view proof setup custom.",
    "You want to set the device to simulate to working Gray dot gain 20%, so this is not something that's automatically set up in your photo shop, but if you follow the directions that I'm showing here, if you set it up one time, it's always going to be fine.",
    "You're always going to be able to use a shortcut and do this switch quickly to black and white, so you go to view.",
    "Proof set up custom and then set the device to simulate to working grade.",
    "Gained 20% and then press OK and then every time you go you use uh control Y you will get a black and white version of your painting and the awesome thing about this is you can color pic while it's in this state you can color pic and paint and it's going to be using the real colors of your actual painting but showing you the black and white version.",
    "So that's Super Super Handy and I hope you guys might find it useful.",
    "And.",
    "Add some little kind of individual leaf type shapes here.",
    "So here's something to note I've been painting with A green color that's a little bit lighter than the.",
    "The tree trunk and the branches.",
    "If I want the branches to still remain the darkest thing I can put this layer instead of on normal mode.",
    "I can put it on dark in, So what that does is.",
    "The what I've painted on this layer is only going to affect.",
    "Um areas that are lighter than the color that I'm painting, so.",
    "Basically this green is lighter than the branches, so it won't lighten them anymore.",
    "Only things will be allowed to darken, not lighten things below them.",
    "I hope it makes sense.",
    "So yeah, I.",
    "Can turn on dark in if I turn it back to normal you'll see the difference, so this is normal.",
    "And this is dark, and so it depends on what you're looking for.",
    "I think I will leave it on normal mode, but I just wanted to play with that and see if I see how it looked to see what we liked.",
    "Alright, so I'll flip this back.",
    "Just wanted to take a little look from the other angle.",
    "If anybody is painting along, I hope it's going well and you're enjoying a painting that's the most important thing.",
    "Hope you're having fun.",
    "Hi Steve, I am using a tablet.",
    "I have a Wakame Centriq 22.",
    "That's the model of tablet that I have and.",
    "Yeah, this kind of painting would be very, very difficult to do with the mouse.",
    "It doesn't mean that you have to run out and buy a super expensive tablet, but I think a tablet would be needed and the reason for that is I'm using brushes that have pressure sensitivity alot.",
    "So that means so if you look at your my brush palette here I have transfer checked.",
    "So what this does is it allows me to press really light.",
    "And then press really dark and you see the difference and you really need to have a tablet to be able to detect this difference in how you're pressing.",
    "If you're using a mouse, you're basically going to have everything at like the full darkness.",
    "You can go up and adjust opacity here, but it's a much more time consuming process, so while you can do a lot of digital art with a mouse, especially like vector art and maybe some matte painting photo bashing type stuff, I really advise if you're going to get into digital painting and you want a more natural look.",
    "To at least just look into tablets, there's they've really come down in price, and there's a lot of different brands available so you don't need to rush out and get an expensive one, but a tablet really is needed for the type of our time doing here.",
    "At least to make it.",
    "More pleasant experience.",
    "Hi, are a welcome.",
    "So I'm going over some of the edges of these of the foliage and just giving them hopefully the look of some texture and leaves.",
    "I like over here on the right there's some branches that come up a little higher.",
    "Are you currently following any art cores?",
    "Are you self employed?",
    "I am self employed.",
    "I am a full time streamer and content creator and painter but.",
    "As far as taking any courses, I am always doing something.",
    "I'm always watching some kind of video on YouTube or gum road or what not.",
    "I'm not in any official schools or anything like that at the moment, but I'm always watching some kind of on line course, it's.",
    "There's just so much out there and I'm always trying to improve, and I'm also just interested in it.",
    "I'm it's kind of like a hobby, aside from what I do professionally.",
    "I really like watching videos and seeing other artists workflows and learning.",
    "What they're up to?",
    "Is it OK to suggest the cheap tablet for beginners I I'm going to share a link with you guys that I shared earlier and you may not have been here, so let me make sure it's in the chat.",
    "This is a link to a tablet review website that's really good and goes over a wide range of beginner tablets and more experienced once it goes all the way down the line and he's got different brands of tablets and different.",
    "Facing some problem in growing my Instagram as an artist.",
    "Can you please brief us?",
    "Hum.",
    "I'm yeah, I'm happy to give advice if I can.",
    "The only thing I want to say is I think that sometimes with Instagram and certain social medias.",
    "Depending on the type of Art you're making, you might find easier growth on one platform versus another platform, sometimes certain platforms.",
    "Have a certain type of content that tends to be like really popular there.",
    "So for example, whether you decide to post on different platforms, you might find success in different places.",
    "So, but what I've done on Instagram is just, you know.",
    "Post pretty frequently if you can, so at some point in time I've been better or worse with this in the past, but post consistently you don't have to post constantly but get on a consistent schedule of some kind.",
    "So even if that's once a week, just try to be somewhat consistent so there's like an even amount of space in between your posts.",
    "Use hashtags.",
    "Post when you post put some information about your content.",
    "Don't just post an image with no information because it's less interesting to people.",
    "So if it's an artwork, maybe talk about something that was difficult when you made it or something you learned.",
    "Or what is your favorite part, or maybe what's your least favorite part or something about the art that might be interesting for people to learn about?",
    "I use the hashtags and post multiple images if you can.",
    "So maybe post the artwork and then some images of your process that's more interesting to people, and I've heard that the algorithms favor images with multiple.",
    "Yeah, multiple images in the image carousel, so not just one would be good and those are some suggestions.",
    "What about targeted audience?",
    "Wait, what do you mean by that pro?",
    "Can you give me some more information?",
    "I'm sorry I'm not I do my own marketing as an artist, but I don't maybe know all the terminology and everything like I haven't studied marketing specifically in school or anything.",
    "So when you say targeted, targeted audience, I think you're referring to.",
    "Are you are you asking me?",
    "How do you decide what your target audience is or what exactly are you asking me?",
    "In the mean time I will start doing some shading here on the background, so I'm going to make a new layer and I will put my layer on multiply mode, multiply as a layer blending mode.",
    "I like to use for shading, it darkens things, but it doesn't completely.",
    "It doesn't cover like what it would do if I was using a normal layer, it's still going to show what is below my area that I'm painting, but it's just going to darken it.",
    "So I'm going to choose a blue and I might.",
    "I might change this color.",
    "Yeah, it's not exactly the effect I want.",
    "I think I'm going to go.",
    "I think I'm going to take a different approach.",
    "Multiply, multiply didn't work.",
    "OK, so I'm going to make an you.",
    "Adjustment layer I think adjustment layer is going to be better, so I'm going to come down here to the half circle icon and let's try levels.",
    "So levels is going to affect the darks and lights in my painting.",
    "An I can choose to darken.",
    "The highlights, midtones and shadows.",
    "This is also affecting the contrast, so you just kind of want to take a look and see if it's going well.",
    "Definitely a lot more contrasts, but The thing is, I'm only interested in this affecting the further area of my painting really.",
    "Uhm, the other thing we could use is curves.",
    "Maybe curves is better.",
    "Yeah, I think that's better.",
    "OK so so here we go.",
    "Finally I tried a few different things and I finally have the result that I want.",
    "That's pretty common for me sometimes you gotta try different things to see what's going to do what you want.",
    "Angie says use relevant hashtags but don't use any with millions of tags.",
    "Use hashtags of things you think people might search.",
    "Be active and support other artists by liking, commenting, sharing in their stories, etc.",
    "Thank you so much, Angie.",
    "You're that's really good advice.",
    "Yeah, you guys listen.",
    "Take countries advice on that.",
    "Just totally right.",
    "OK, so I'm going to so now what I want to do is block out.",
    "Areas that I don't want to be affected by this mask.",
    "This adjustment layer that I created, so there's automatically a mask here you can see the rectangle that's.",
    "Um, white.",
    "If I take a black paint brush using airbrush right now anywhere that I paint with black, it's going to basically bring back the layer below.",
    "Styles of tablet.",
    "And I would look into that because I have a really hard time suggesting tablets because.",
    "There's so many like for one person, their budget can be really, really different.",
    "I would say I've heard a lot of good things about XP pen.",
    "If you're looking for a cheap tablet that has a has a screen they actually have, I think the least expensive screen tablet right now.",
    "So it depends on if you're looking for a tablet, the screen, the Wakame Intuos is a really good option for a non sweetened tablet.",
    "I wouldn't call it cheap, but for the for the.",
    "Price you get a very good quality tablet that will potentially last for years and be able to scale up with you as your skill level grows.",
    "There's a lot of professional artists using the welcome intuos, and it's also good one to start on.",
    "But if you're looking for a screen tablet and you don't want to spend too much money, I think XP pen is really good.",
    "But I haven't tried them myself so far I've been.",
    "I've been using walk home all the way through so I can only recommend based on reviews that I've watched and what I've heard other people talk about.",
    "Yeah, that's right.",
    "I CS pressure.",
    "The pressure levels is super super important.",
    "Thank you bro.",
    "Yeah if you guys have used any particular tablets and you want to chime in with your experience, that's always welcome.",
    "I always appreciate the first hand experience commentary when we have questions like that, so red can recommend Huey on tablets.",
    "I've also heard really good things about Huey on.",
    "I'm not sure.",
    "Again, it depends on your price range.",
    "I think that they might possibly be a little bit more expensive than XP pen, but I've heard only good things so far.",
    "OK, so I want to go back to this layer and add in between the foliage and the rock layer in the background.",
    "I'd like to add some more bright colors.",
    "Love the intuos pro medium.",
    "Been using it for a long time now.",
    "That's why I always hear about people using the into US.",
    "They seem to last a long time.",
    "Nice, Julian.",
    "Seems like a good deal.",
    "Yeah, it's really amazing.",
    "The prices of tablets Luckily has have come down a lot in the past, like over the last five years it's been crazy.",
    "So it's.",
    "Going in the right direction as far as making it more accessible.",
    "I want to keep this.",
    "I want to keep the color really really bright, especially right behind the.",
    "Right behind the foliage, so I'm going to go to color dynamics and again turn that on so we get these cool color variations back here.",
    "Read says it's the same price range than XP pen.",
    "I had two one note screen and one of the screen completely in love.",
    "Offered the no screen one through a friend.",
    "When I received the screen one for my birthday.",
    "Oh, that's really nice red.",
    "I'm glad to hear you had such a good experience.",
    "So if you look up here at the top left, you'll see that there's some.",
    "Sort of striping kind of effect on the.",
    "Mountain back here from the light hitting and getting these kind of detailed columns.",
    "Started with a bamboo.",
    "Had into us at work.",
    "Great surface drawing.",
    "Now I'm using a mobile studio which is fantastic but he's like hell sometimes that's what I see.",
    "It says in the chat.",
    "Yeah.",
    "The bamboo that was a classic one.",
    "I never had a bamboo.",
    "I feel a little left out.",
    "But I heard that those tablets lasted a long time.",
    "OK, so just to explain what I'm doing right now, I'm just kind of going back to my block in of the mountain in the background and adding more detail.",
    "That was lighter.",
    "So anywhere that I want it to be later, all I have to do is paint with black onto this mask and then anywhere that I want to stay dark, I just.",
    "Leave it alone.",
    "So I think that's an improvement, so I'm going to merge it down because I don't, you know, the great thing about adjustment layers as you can leave them there, but for my purposes I'm trying to.",
    "Yeah, I don't want.",
    "I don't need it to stay there.",
    "I just wanted to use it to do that darkening effect so.",
    "Let's continue.",
    "James is, if you haven't already, you can make your account and artist account and you can see insights.",
    "The number of impressions on posts and see which hashtags work best.",
    "That's a good idea.",
    "I did that on one of my accounts and not the other one, and I've been thinking about doing it there too.",
    "Yeah, you can see a lot more about.",
    "Which posts are successful and kind of what's going on behind the scenes?",
    "It'll analytics and things.",
    "OK, so I want to start adding in foliage and plants.",
    "Thanks Hun Ji.",
    "It's good advice.",
    "So I think for the first time in this painting, I'm going to switch to a different brush.",
    "I'm trying to find something.",
    "That would be good for what I want to do next.",
    "You may end up just sticking with the same brush.",
    "I just want to be good.",
    "There's virtually no downside of converting an Instagram account to business.",
    "Or is there?",
    "I don't think there is a downside.",
    "There were rumors that there was a downside that.",
    "It was rumored that Instagram doesn't give as good engagement to like.",
    "Business accounts as it does to regular account, so I don't know if the artist account would count as that, but.",
    "I haven't personally experienced any negatives from switching my one account, so.",
    "I might switch to the other one too.",
    "Process related to an above question about growing Instagram artists account, so I say that what is target audience in related field?",
    "I don't understand.",
    "I'm sorry bro.",
    "You might just be going over my head like I don't understand the question.",
    "I apologize.",
    "Just that I'm not sure what you're asking me to answer.",
    "What is the targeted audience?",
    "Is that what you're asking?",
    "I mean, it's good to think about.",
    "I'm not sure if this is what you're referring to, but it is good to think about like who the type of person is that you're trying to reach with your posts, and what they would be interested in, and what hashtags they would use.",
    "So if that's what you mean, I agree with that.",
    "All right, so we're getting in our first tree shapes finally.",
    "I'm probably going to do these on separate layers just so I have the freedom to move them around and really be sure where I'm placing the trees.",
    "Once I'm going to one style, you know.",
    "Firm that I'm happy with my choice, then I will.",
    "Murdered down.",
    "He's asking about whom should be target an who will like to see our post.",
    "OK, OK?",
    "Well.",
    "I don't know that I have the answers to that.",
    "So I'm doing this on another layer.",
    "Can turn the layer on and off and see.",
    "Hopefully we're going in a good direction.",
    "Sometimes I end up saying, oh, I'm going to erase out something that I did.",
    "Sometimes you paint for awhile and then you look at the before and after and you're like it didn't really go in the direction I wanted, but.",
    "Yes, I like to.",
    "Keep the layers, keep the new update that I'm doing on a layer above what already exists there.",
    "If I'm happy with that and then you can kind of paint for awhile.",
    "Check out your work, see if it's going well, and then finally merge it down.",
    "If you do like it, that's kind of what I like to do in these scenarios, so I do like to keep merging fairly quickly and keep things on minimal layers.",
    "But I also want to make sure that I like what I've done before I merge it down.",
    "Nice I frame.",
    "Yeah I have recently tried the iPad for painting for the first time.",
    "Well, I say recently but.",
    "Time is going by.",
    "It was for Christmas that I got one and I was also really impressed.",
    "Been happy with it so far.",
    "Although most of the painting that I do is still on PC but it's really nice to play around with.",
    "Hopefully I can get more familiar.",
    "Alright, so I will merge these down now.",
    "And also I think I'm going to turn off the sketch layer because I think everything that I had planned to do in the sketches now in.",
    "So I don't think we need to sketch layer anymore to guide us.",
    "I'll leave it there.",
    "Just turn the visibility off just in case.",
    "I don't throw it away.",
    "Um?",
    "Yeah, let's keep going.",
    "So make a new layer.",
    "And come to the.",
    "The mountain here maybe a race out.",
    "And I want to bring in some of these details.",
    "I'm going to turn off color dynamics now 'cause I need to be more precise.",
    "So I don't want my colors to be all over the place.",
    "I want to bring in some of these little.",
    "Shadows and things.",
    "Is there any focus on the work this morning?",
    "Just an icepick Waterstones true Sky yeah this so this painting isn't really in any kind of theme.",
    "It's not part of our the art club studies or anything like that.",
    "I just wanted to paint something nice and relaxing today and this scene is got a lot of my favorite things in it because I love painting Canyon scenes and I also love foliage and there's a little bit of both.",
    "In this one so.",
    "Just the types I did take a day to relax and paint something pretty.",
    "But my focus as far as like what I'm trying to work on in this scene, is mostly.",
    "I want to work on brushwork using some interesting brushwork and hopefully capturing the mood of the scene.",
    "So I've been trying to work on, you know, painting in a more painterly style.",
    "So having my paintings appear more like traditional painting.",
    "And the idea that you get across the mood of the scene even if we don't paint it hyper.",
    "Realistically, you can still get across the mood in the feeling of being there.",
    "Am I too late for this loan or how long we work on it?",
    "I want to paint along but it is early here.",
    "I'm bleary.",
    "I know it's really early for you.",
    "I'm sorry, clever.",
    "Let me take a peek at what time it is.",
    "So we've been.",
    "We've been.",
    "Live for.",
    "Yeah, it's been almost an hour.",
    "Not quite yet.",
    "Actually, it has been an hour.",
    "I forgot I've started early earlier.",
    "Yeah, I will probably work it be working on this for I imagine another hour at least to get all the try to get nice details in and get it to a more finished place.",
    "I would imagine another hour and then we might work on another study after, but you're always welcome to continue on this one if you need more than an hour, for example.",
    "We might work on another study directly after this one.",
    "So there's some little Tufts of grass is, and things coming up in between rocks here in there, so I want to kind of pop in these little green bits.",
    "Of course, that's something that I'm trying to do a good job with as well when I'm posting, but that's a little bit of something that you kind of learn as you go, I think.",
    "And it depends on the individual what they're trying to do with their art.",
    "Are you trying to create a portfolio that?",
    "Yeah, exactly hungry or it will depend on the person and what their goals are with their art, who they're trying to reach?",
    "Are they trying to have art directors see their work because they want to get hired for a company?",
    "Are they trying to sell their prints to individuals?",
    "Then they might be looking at a different demographic of people that are interested in buying decorations for their home.",
    "That could be a very wide range of people, so it depends on what you're trying to achieve with your art and whether you're trying to sell something or just.",
    "Show off your portfolio for a job.",
    "That will really change.",
    "Maybe your your audience that your ideal.",
    "Audience and I don't know that I can give any specific answer other than you know it's something good to think about an.",
    "It might change overtime.",
    "But so much of this is trial and error, and it's good to watch videos.",
    "There's a lot of YouTube videos about these topics with people that are much more knowledgeable specifically about that than me because I have a relatively small following compared to some of the larger creators with like hundreds of thousands of followers, and you can find videos from those types of creators.",
    "On YouTube, maybe they'd have better advice 'cause I'm kind of still on my way trying to also figure out these things.",
    "I'm happy to share what I've learned up to this point.",
    "Um?",
    "Monir says target audience is what type of people do you want to your posts to reach?",
    "OK, I understand I understand, thank you.",
    "Yeah I get what targeted audience means, but I wasn't understanding his question, but I think I think we got it now.",
    "I hope I hope we were able to answer it.",
    "Answer it a little bit.",
    "I really like these tree shapes.",
    "They're fun to make little bends and turns in them.",
    "So I have the trees on one layer right now, so I'm going to go back to each tree and give a little bit of more detail to each individual tree while they're on their own layer.",
    "I find it easiest to do this.",
    "So.",
    "While they're on their own layer, I can go in and.",
    "Push the lock transparency.",
    "Right here.",
    "You just press this button.",
    "The little checkerboard icon.",
    "Now you're able to paint easily within the lines.",
    "Be scenes as I think you most mostly need to figure out what you want to do, because if you change in the name of an audience, chances are you will no longer take pleasure in doing it.",
    "I think that is good advice in the most important thing is that you're doing what you want to do with your art, an marketing and all that is important too, of course.",
    "But I agree that you kind of want to decide what you want to do and then figure out how to market that rather than changing what you're doing to fit in with marketing.",
    "OK, let me check it out.",
    "Yeah I know what you mean about Instagram is not super landscape painting friendly.",
    "Oh, that came out really nice.",
    "What a pretty scene.",
    "I wish I could make it bigger.",
    "Beautiful, the lighting looks great.",
    "Strong shapes, I like that you added the butterfly was that there.",
    "I don't remember there being a butterfly.",
    "Maybe I just missed it but.",
    "Very good vibes.",
    "Hey Graphics.",
    "So I'm going to brighten up the.",
    "Going to try this or similar in Frisco.",
    "I would love to see that.",
    "That's a great idea.",
    "And back here in the.",
    "As the River curves around the foliage is coming all the way down here to the where the water meets up with the land and it's just all green.",
    "Al Green down there.",
    "Bring in some of these little.",
    "Details so those of you who have been watching this from the beginning or from earlier on, you'll see that the process kind of does slow down.",
    "At some point the early stages of this painting go really, really fast, but depending on what you want your.",
    "Level of Polish to be.",
    "It does take some time, it thinks do kind of slow down.",
    "Once you start getting into, you know starting to flesh out details and starting to clean things up, so that's kind of where I am now.",
    "Things have slowed down a little bit, but.",
    "Yeah, it will pay off.",
    "I think we get things looking a little nicer.",
    "There's a rock that comes out over here, that's a.",
    "Bit of a.",
    "Square rectangular shape.",
    "I think I will add that in.",
    "A little darker overall in the shadows over here.",
    "And there's a bit of rim lighting, which I'm a big fan of.",
    "I mean, who isn't but a little bit of light hitting the top of this.",
    "This rock over here.",
    "Little bit of warm light tops that out.",
    "I'm here too.",
    "Blood or not, that's rim lighting, but give it a little lighting.",
    "So.",
    "I think.",
    "I'm getting close to wanting to merge the foliage layer onto the layer of the mountains and just paint that all is one.",
    "Have the freedom to just paint the wherever?",
    "So let's just.",
    "Erase out a couple more things that I think.",
    "That I don't love and then we'll just merge them.",
    "OK, so here's our layers.",
    "Basically, the background gradients and then everything else.",
    "I think it might be nice to paint a little bit in the Sky.",
    "I can basically just take any.",
    "Any brush and I don't want to ruin the nice gradient we have there, but if I am trying to give this nice traditional kind of feeling, it might be nice to just put some brush strokes in the Sky just as like a stylistic thing, but we don't need to.",
    "It doesn't really need to make sense, it just needs to look cool.",
    "Sometimes we can have our brush strokes kind of aiming in towards the focal point.",
    "Now if you were to use this, indicate cloud something like that you could add some clouds this scene.",
    "But you know, sometimes there's these light wispy clouds up in the Sky, so even just some of these light brush strokes can indicate just a little bit of clouds without us needing to really over explain them or get too specific with the clouds and it just keeps things a little interesting, so I'm going to keep the brushstrokes aiming inward towards the focal point.",
    "You can lower the Opacity on that if it's too much, but it's fun to experiment with.",
    "Alright, I will merge that down so some barely there brush strokes in this guy think is kind of cool.",
    "We can always come back to it later since that layer is on its own.",
    "It's pretty safe.",
    "Take a moment for some tea.",
    "Tree a little bit.",
    "Adding bounces lay on the left and right.",
    "Who?",
    "So these trees in the back should be a little bit extra dark and then.",
    "We can add this medium Brown as a highlight because they're so dark will actually be able to.",
    "See that color?",
    "Is definitely a challenge organizing the shading this way.",
    "If I'm painting with more of a digital type of Workflow.",
    "Rather than imitating my traditional painting, I find it's a little easier to paint with gradients and things.",
    "Rather than what I'm doing here, but hopefully the extra challenge will be worth it.",
    "Hi Christopher, welcome.",
    "Welcome, I hope you're having a good day.",
    "If you or anyone wants to take a look at the reference image that I'm painting from.",
    "You can find it below the stream as usual in the stream description.",
    "Season says maybe silly question, but how do you decide on what size to make your artboard when you're starting out?",
    "OK, so it's not silly.",
    "I'm a little bit all over the place with this, so it kind of depends on the situation.",
    "So if I'm making a quick study and it's just going to be something that I show online an I might not ever make a print of it.",
    "If I'm pretty sure I'm not going to print it and it's just something that I might post later on Instagram and I'm just doing it for a quick study practice, I'll make the image pretty small.",
    "It'll be easier for me to work with.",
    "Less lag on your computer.",
    "You know it's just easier less.",
    "Less problems all around smaller file so I will in that case paint around 2015 hundred pixels.",
    "Something like that, but if I feel like it's an image that I really like, even if it's just a study.",
    "If I feel like there's any chance that I might want to make a print of it, I will consider making it a little bit bigger from the start, like this one is 2000 by 3000 pixels.",
    "It's big enough to make a small print if I end up really liking this one just because I was a big fan of the setting.",
    "If I'm painting something that I want to definitely want to print that I'm going to make it much larger from the start.",
    "Maybe a minimum of like 5000 by 7000 pixels, and you know I'll be working in 300 DPI from the start.",
    "Usually the ones that I'm only ever planning to share on the web, I'll just paint those at 72.",
    "Hi Kelly, welcome.",
    "Yeah, not a math crunchy 1 honey.",
    "I was I was searching and I just didn't find anything that really.",
    "It wasn't feeling it, you know?",
    "I wanted one with like the just the perfect kind of lighting and I wasn't finding it, so I decided to find one from Unsplash.",
    "Alright, we're finally going to add some some trees leaves.",
    "Perhaps OK, good.",
    "So I'm going to put the color dynamics on my brush so that it's going to give a little bit of huge jitter.",
    "It might not be much.",
    "But the idea is as I'm painting.",
    "It's giving us light striping effect to the brush.",
    "It's kind of hard to see, but it is there.",
    "Yes, it graphics, so I've so far I painted this whole scene in photo shop from the start.",
    "So I didn't begin with a traditional sketch or anything like that.",
    "For example, this was all done in photo shop.",
    "If you're interested in seeing it from the start later after the stream is over, it's you can always find the replay if you go to my profile here on be hands and go to the videos tab, all of my past livestreams are there, so if there's if you wanted to see it from the start you can find it there.",
    "OK.",
    "So painting on a layer above the.",
    "The rocks and everything.",
    "And this is a little bit of trial and error here, but I'm grabbing some brushes that I think can give a little bit of a wispy kind of texture for some of these random grasses and things going on here.",
    "And I'm trying to stick to natural looking green, so I'm keeping them pretty desaturated.",
    "I'm trying not to go with any like bright bright greens.",
    "You know, those like Saint Patrick's Day kind of greens.",
    "It took me along time painting foliage to be able to choose more natural looking greens.",
    "I always would oversaturate them, and again, that could be a style could be a style that if you're if you paint very cold, very colorful, and that's your thing, something wrong with it, but I was going for a realistic looking.",
    "I was struggling to get that, and one of the biggest things that I learned.",
    "Was that a lot of times green has more yellow than you think.",
    "It's more towards like an olive yellow color than you might think to get some of these.",
    "These realistic looking green colors, so that might be happening to you too.",
    "If you feel any struggle with your green paintings, try adding a little more yellow.",
    "Some nice little.",
    "Tufts down here.",
    "I think it is important for them to be darker at the bottom.",
    "Later at the top.",
    "So you can turn the layer on and off.",
    "I do find that once I've merged a bunch of layers, I find a lot more.",
    "I make a lot more quick progress after that step.",
    "Then I find it a lot more freedom to just paint wherever I want to paint over mistakes rather than trying to go back to whatever layer that was on and maybe erase it or whatever you know, just paint over it there.",
    "Kings on one layer, nice.",
    "Of course, depending on the art style you're going for, that might not work.",
    "If you want things to be very clean and you've got like line art and then separate layers, then you don't want to merge it down and they have a pain later when you're trying to separate things.",
    "So it depends.",
    "One of my favorite things in painting foliage is when you get an effect of a lighter background shining through the trees or plants and you get this a lot with, you know, the nice bright Sky shining through and back.",
    "Here we have a situation where the.",
    "Light is shining on these mountains, and that's creating the same kind of effect, and so let me choose a brush for this.",
    "But basically you can do fun things like leaving color pic from this bright orange and then find a couple places and just paint that back in.",
    "In this big blob BLOB BLOB of Green.",
    "And it looks like little spaces in between the.",
    "Bush is in the trees, you know, at least to me.",
    "I think it's working.",
    "And that's pretty cool.",
    "Hi welcome everybody.",
    "Yeah, you can paint this little dots.",
    "Merge it down and then I make a new layer so I do a lot of like merging and then immediately making a new layer.",
    "And that's because I like the overall of.",
    "Process of having the merged, but I do like to have the ability to paint on that separate layer kind of check my work before merging it down so it's a little bit of for me.",
    "It's kinda best of both worlds.",
    "That's my workflow.",
    "So I'm going to take a darker color and start trying to paint in some.",
    "Indication of stones and.",
    "Rocks and things over here.",
    "There's also pretty.",
    "But yes, I'm using photo shop and the whole thing has been done in here so far.",
    "I really enjoy painting in Photoshop.",
    "OK, so this tree as we're getting closer to us, this tree is going to be.",
    "It's actually a little is it a different type of tree?",
    "I'll know they're the same, the same type of tree, but the they just this one that's closer to us is getting.",
    "Hit by light very brightly so its leaves look more green, more bright green, yellow green color.",
    "Even so, it's nice to have a little variation, some medium and dark green deeper in the tree, and then the lights on the outside.",
    "Hi Pearl, how long will it take you to finish when painting?",
    "By the way, it's very nice.",
    "Thank you.",
    "It depends on the painting for what the type of thing I'm doing right now.",
    "My goal is to spend around 3 hours on this.",
    "I started about an hour and.",
    "10 minutes ago.",
    "Yeah, so an hour in 10 hour and 15 minutes ago so.",
    "I'm hoping in like 2 more hours I can finish the painting now that's not going to be a super super polished detailed painting.",
    "It's more of a study an hopefully it's going to look nice at the end still, but it's not going to be like super super polished if I want to Polish a work up then I can take a lot more time on it anywhere from like.",
    "Aids 1220 or 30 hours for detailed illustration with characters and things like that in the background, but for something like this, I'm going to try to do it in about 3 hours.",
    "We'll see.",
    "We'll see how it goes.",
    "I'm drinking tea.",
    "I'm drinking tea right now.",
    "Green tea with honey.",
    "So I first painted the.",
    "The tree trunks then behind the layer of the tree trunks I painted.",
    "The first layer of foliage, but now I'm going to go on top because I want the tree trunks to feel like very covered by the leaves.",
    "Thank you thanks Christopher.",
    "Well.",
    "Thank you, I really like this scene.",
    "It's really, really pretty reference, so.",
    "There's a lot of things that I like about the lighting, and I hope that I can really make those things pop out in a more dramatic way in my painting by the end.",
    "I like both tea and coffee, but I'm drinking.",
    "I'm drinking tea.",
    "So I really like this blue bounce light that's on the tree back here.",
    "I don't know if you guys can see, but what I'm working on right now, it's like.",
    "Blue teal color on some of the leaves in the references.",
    "Bit small, but.",
    "It's really really beautiful effect and.",
    "When the leaves aren't getting direct light hitting them, but there's a little bit of light.",
    "Light blue bounce light from the Sky or the surroundings bouncing off the leaves so pretty.",
    "And then it's nice to kind of contrast that with a more yellow green where the sun is directly hitting.",
    "Hi Merlin, I have a Wakeham Centriq 22.",
    "So I do have a screen tablet an I'm using the stylus right on the screen so I can see my artwork there.",
    "But there's a lot of different types of tablets out there.",
    "You certainly don't have to have this exact one.",
    "So there's lots of different options, lots more affordable options coming out these days.",
    "Which is nice.",
    "If you guys are looking for any.",
    "Information about purchasing tablets or finding good ones?",
    "Stuff like that.",
    "There's a link below my stream in the description that's for my resources page.",
    "You should be able to find it down their resources and tutorials page that has a bunch of helpful links that I've compiled over the past years that I've been doing digital art.",
    "Dark shadow over here under this rock so.",
    "As we get as things get closer and closer to us, then we're going to get more of those real colors.",
    "Those local colors and.",
    "Also, darker shadows.",
    "Overall like everything back here, these mountains.",
    "Nothing is going to be really really dark there, so I'm going to be pretty light, but here we're getting into the darker things.",
    "I have customized these brushes and they are not available yet because I'm still working on making them, but when they're finished I will.",
    "They will be for sale.",
    "But there is a free brush pack under the description.",
    "You may maybe saw it already, but there is a free brush back that I used for quite a long time and I still love is a good brush pack.",
    "That's what I was using up before I started trying to make these so there's a lot of good brushes there.",
    "If you need some.",
    "Of traditional textures and things, but at the moment the one I'm using right now I'm in the process of testing it, so I'm sorry I can't share it yet.",
    "But what I'm doing today and with a lot of these recent streams is I've just been using this brush set so that I can test it and tweak the textures and as soon as it's ready then it will be available.",
    "Bye.",
    "But I want it to be really good.",
    "I don't want any weird glitches or anything, so we're taking our time.",
    "Going to switch to a flat brush.",
    "Try to get some of these shines in the water.",
    "So back here the water does have some.",
    "Dark.",
    "Areas, and that's part of what makes it look shiny, so.",
    "For anybody who needs any tips on painting shiny things, one thing that I noticed is it really helps if you put high contrasts.",
    "A lot of what makes things look shiny is high contrast, very bright and very dark areas next to each other.",
    "That will make something look shiny and hard edges, so it's kind of tough.",
    "But gotta be bold.",
    "Gotta go.",
    "High contrast.",
    "Be brave.",
    "Then it will be shiny promise.",
    "So there's a lot of pink in the water.",
    "I in the reference, that's what I'm seeing and I think it's a lot of reflection of this back here.",
    "It's like a.",
    "This all this light from the mountain reflecting kind of pink and.",
    "Non colors in the water.",
    "I think it's pretty.",
    "There's some kind of ripple effects, so I'm going to try to paint those in.",
    "I'm basically painting.",
    "It's hard to see right now, but I'm painting like little angle strokes like this down here.",
    "I'm trying to get.",
    "These like ripple.",
    "Triple shapes.",
    "And some will be highlights and some will be rolled darker, darker ripples.",
    "I still feel like this area on the left is not quite dark enough, let's.",
    "Let's go a little bit darker.",
    "In the water.",
    "There's a lot of shadow.",
    "From all this foliage.",
    "And it should be a little bit more dark.",
    "Trying to find the right color.",
    "But I'm trying to keep my brush strokes going in the direction of the water is flowing.",
    "I hope that's going to give it some kind of motion.",
    "Anne will flip the canvas.",
    "'cause I haven't flipped in awhile maybe?",
    "Maybe this helps.",
    "Sometimes I flip my canvas o'clock when I'm painting, but I hope it doesn't annoy anyone.",
    "To watch.",
    "But I find it really helpful if anybody is wondering.",
    "The first section of that page has a link links to different tablet buying guides and reviews and things like that.",
    "So if you're looking to get a tablet for the first time, you might want to check that out.",
    "If you are kind of just getting into that.",
    "Alright, I'm gonna dark in the.",
    "Tree branches a little bit, I'm just noticing in the reference these are really dark and almost just the silhouette back here.",
    "For your left hand to use the tablet buttons or keyboard or one of the specialized keyboard things, I have always been a fan of just using the regular old keyboard shortcuts, so that's what I'm using.",
    "The tablet that I'm using now, they actually they welcome centriq 22 HD used to have buttons on it.",
    "Well it still does, but the gnu 22 does not have buttons so my tablet doesn't have any buttons on it.",
    "Even if I wanted them.",
    "But Luckily I don't.",
    "I'm fine with the keyboard, I prefer the keyboard because.",
    "It always stays the same and I'm used to it.",
    "I don't have to.",
    "Worry about it changing.",
    "I'm that was one thing I was worried about and getting used to the tablet keys.",
    "Sometimes the different changes to the models of the tablets and I was kind of worried about having to relearn my keyboard shortcuts.",
    "So I decided to.",
    "Stick with the keyboard, but hey, you got to do what's right for you.",
    "What feels comfortable, that's super important.",
    "You have to be comfortable while you're working, so there's no real right or wrong way to do the keyboard shortcuts.",
    "As long as you.",
    "Personalize them to yourself.",
    "Oh, thank you uninvolved.",
    "This very nice of you, thanks.",
    "I'm just rearranging my tree is a little bit from the original position.",
    "I want.",
    "I want this one in the back to be a little bit lower.",
    "I think too.",
    "I think I could have just lowered all of them.",
    "OK, I'm going to merge my trees so now my trees are all on one layer and then I'll just keep painting from here.",
    "Hail avenged how's your day going?",
    "OK, so a little bit of shadows and deeper part of this tree again to give dimension.",
    "So we definitely want some dark green here and then we want to move up into more of a yellow green where the light is hitting.",
    "And I'm using a brush that's creating a leaf texture, but I might go on top of this after I let the brush kind of block things in for me and get some of the some of the look of this detail.",
    "I'm probably going to go in and do some of my own leaves too.",
    "Are using new brush presets.",
    "Yeah, I'm using some custom.",
    "I'm working on creating a custom brush set so I've made these brushes myself.",
    "The ones I'm using right now and I'm kind of testing them out so I can't show these ones yet.",
    "There still kind of being tweaked, but I do have a brush that you can download for free below in the description if you're interested.",
    "Up to this point of me creating the brush that I'm working on now that was like my main brush set I've been using for the past.",
    "I don't know over a year.",
    "So there's a lot of good brushes there too, if you are interested in trying them out, but the ones I'm using today will be available in the future.",
    "I pay you $1,000,000.",
    "Don't worry all they'll be much less expensive than that, but I just need to finish finish them up.",
    "Make sure they're all working good and I want to release a brush pack with them so there's a few more that I want to create an include, but it's going well so far.",
    "Thank you Ricardo.",
    "Welcome back gene.",
    "Well, I hope you guys are doing well.",
    "Thanks for joining again.",
    "But the goal of these brushes that I'm making here are to kind of imitate a little bit more of traditional painting textures.",
    "It just kind of gives you a fresh look at what you're doing.",
    "Sort of forces your brain to reprocess the image somehow, and like you'll notice little wonky things sometimes.",
    "What brushes do you use for your initial blocking?",
    "So I am using brushes from a brush pack that I'm creating so they're not available yet, but there's a brush very similar to the one that I used to block this in.",
    "If you download the brush pack in the description below.",
    "There's brush called rectangle texture, and that's a great brush for blocking things in.",
    "It's got a little bit of it's a rectangle brush, which is similar to what I was using an it's got a lot of.",
    "Well, it has a nice texture.",
    "It's not too strong.",
    "But I have hard edges and it's really good for blocking things in, so I would try that one and eventually hopefully soon I'll be able to share the one that I was actually using.",
    "But I'm still working on it.",
    "Up Great tip getting shiny nice, thanks for him and I really hope it helps.",
    "I remember paintings honestly.",
    "The first part when I when I started to realize that about shiny textures, I was doing some fan art of.",
    "Catwoman and I was painting her outfit, which was very shiny, and I was being there is being very careful.",
    "I was being timid with the texture and it was looking very mad.",
    "And then eventually after studying a lot of pictures of like latex, I realized that.",
    "You really need to go super bold with the darks and lights.",
    "And anyway I learned that lesson.",
    "It's helped alot in other subjects to other than painting costume Catwoman but yeah I hope it helps.",
    "I see us as I find it a bit faster to change the blending mode of the brush rather than than the color really.",
    "So you like to turn the brush onto like color, Dodge or something like that instead of.",
    "Instead of.",
    "Changing the color.",
    "I do like using blending modes, but I generally use them to kind of alter and edit what I've done usually later in the painting process.",
    "Rather than a lot of times during the painting, but that has changed, I used to use blending modes a lot more often.",
    "I think that as I've gotten a little bit more comfortable with choosing my own colors, yeah, I feel like I'm choosing the colors I want more quickly in the painting process.",
    "Then before so I'm using normal layer more often, but I really like color Dodge overlay.",
    "Multiply all those for helping to alter things that I've done.",
    "Yeah, Catwoman has a lot of shine, so true high manual welcome.",
    "Thanks for being here.",
    "OK, so I want to work on this sort of outcropping or she wants to call it, but this area of land that comes protrudes out into the water.",
    "I feel like how I've painted mine right now is just not.",
    "It's just not enough.",
    "There's too much water and I really like the shapes of these rocks coming out and I'm going to block in a bigger area here.",
    "Maybe we'll go back to the initial.",
    "Brush that I was using to block things in but we need.",
    "Need more land?",
    "Come out.",
    "There's like a little beach type.",
    "All thanks could you?",
    "I thought that was you.",
    "I thought that was you.",
    "Thanks for coming over.",
    "Hope you're having a good day.",
    "Do you ever bake all the layers and use the camera raw filter to tweak the colors and value?",
    "Uhm, I have not, but that's an interesting idea.",
    "But I have not done that.",
    "what I usually do for tweaking that stuff personally is I'll use adjustment layers.",
    "So yeah, I'll just use adjustment layers that they at the end or sometimes during the process if I'm stuck on something, I'll use adjustment layers to help figure it out, so that's usually my way of doing it, but there's so many ways to do things there's so many different ways to do things in photo shop, so a lot of it will come down to what you find comfortable in your workflow.",
    "There's a lot of ways to answer certain questions.",
    "Different ways to do it.",
    "Are red shared a study from a reference from pixels, let's see.",
    "Ooh, I love this kind of environment.",
    "I was actually thinking of painting something like this today.",
    "That's beautiful red oops.",
    "OK, there goes my whole.",
    "All my stuff, sorry about that you guys.",
    "Anyway.",
    "And hopefully just to be fun to use.",
    "That's something I really want.",
    "I like to make brushes that are like really fun to paint with and not difficult or tricky.",
    "'cause I.",
    "I just want to relax, have a more relaxing painting process.",
    "Would you like to paint any photo street?",
    "I usually like to pick the photos for myself.",
    "I have a little bit of certain tastes of what I like to paint, so I usually choose them.",
    "If you are a photographer and you like to share your work, if you're interested in joining my discord community, I'll put a link in the chat.",
    "For that, there's areas in there that you can share your art, whether your photographer or painter.",
    "Whatever you do.",
    "If you'd like to share, you can post it in there if you're interested.",
    "No pressure, of course.",
    "Do you have a YouTube channel?",
    "No I don't.",
    "I'm sorry about that.",
    "I mean I do have a YouTube account.",
    "But I don't.",
    "I haven't uploaded any videos to the channel.",
    "I had a couple on there like years and years ago, but I just don't have time to make videos for YouTube.",
    "I do a lot of live streaming if you're interested in seeing any past videos of my streams, like when I'm not live, you can check the.",
    "You can check my page and my profile.",
    "There's a videos tab and there you can see any past livestreams and you can kind of Fast forward through him to get through parts you're interested in, so that's the best thing I have where you the great thing about watching past streams here on Behance as they have a tool timeline.",
    "This is running while I'm streaming so it's capturing information about the tools that I'm using as I'm using them, so if I'm going a little faster if there's something I'm doing you're curious about we can always ask me in the chat, but.",
    "You can also watch the stream later.",
    "In the replay you'll be able to see information along with the stream next to it about what tools I'm using and that might be easier.",
    "Depending on how you like to visualize things.",
    "OK, I want to move down to the random plants and.",
    "Things down here under the trees so I didn't merge the trees down yet, which is good 'cause I need to paint underneath of that layer.",
    "It's going to be a lot easier.",
    "Like this, so a bunch of these trees back here have kind of a similar texture to them.",
    "We can go a little bit a little bit later Green on top of these.",
    "Darker Green Shadows.",
    "A little bit of a cool teal reflecting off.",
    "And there's a little plant over here.",
    "Will just leave it for now with these dots.",
    "Appeared there's some plants in a pot hanging down.",
    "Well, if any of you are painting along, I hope it's going well and you're enjoying your painting.",
    "I feel like right now we're getting to the stage in mind, that's like.",
    "A little bit that awkward stage when you're working on a painting where a lot of things are blocked in, but then other things aren't, so it's kind of.",
    "Yeah, it's just I feel like it's a little hard sometimes to visualize when you get into this certain phase.",
    "How to get to the end?",
    "From here, there's still like a lot that needs to be done.",
    "But we're just going to keep going.",
    "We will get there.",
    "Thank you honey, you're so sweet.",
    "I'm doing good I'm I've still got mighty here.",
    "I should be able to make it through the painting.",
    "I don't know if we'll do a second one today, but.",
    "Should be alright.",
    "OK, so we're going to put in some little plant pots down here in the background.",
    "Just going to choose.",
    "Hopefully a good brush for that.",
    "This little Terra cotta pots.",
    "Take that back here and we want to put a little bit of warmer, lighter color.",
    "Top.",
    "So again, I'm trying to visualize this more as a traditional painting.",
    "So it's OK if everything isn't very, very precise, and if you can see individual paint strokes and things like that.",
    "There's a like a shortcut that closed on my windows.",
    "Bring everything back now.",
    "Anyway, beautiful work read.",
    "I hope you guys can see this.",
    "I love the lighting and I love all these leaves especially in this area.",
    "Let's see if I can bring back the chat there.",
    "We go trying hard to do environment stuff while you're doing very well.",
    "I love this group of leaves.",
    "He ran in this area with the high contrast and the light shining through.",
    "Gives a really really pretty 5.",
    "Well done.",
    "Very well done.",
    "Thanks for sharing.",
    "Yeah, I'm wait the depending on what we have time for today we might do.",
    "Do a waterfall scene that's like some of my favourites.",
    "Subject matters of paint.",
    "I find waterfalls actually pretty difficult to paint, but for some reason I still like painting them.",
    "So like such a such a beautiful, lush environment, usually surrounding waterfalls.",
    "Alright, so back to our little.",
    "Area here.",
    "So the before and after.",
    "I think it's getting better, but we still gotta keep going.",
    "Bring this out further.",
    "It's just a little bit more interesting.",
    "This coming out into the water and then we get these nice texture texture variety between the.",
    "The shiny water reflective and then the very matte surface of this sand.",
    "I think that's really nice contrast.",
    "And there's some little rocks in the water.",
    "I don't know if I will include all of them.",
    "I think it's a bit busy.",
    "It's easier to read the scene maybe without so many, but a couple of them I think will do the job.",
    "So let's try it on another layer, 'cause I'm like happy with what we have so far.",
    "Let's try another layer in case I don't like what I do.",
    "And I will just paint in some rocks.",
    "And also erase out.",
    "The bottom if we don't get a flat enough, we need the bottom to be really flexed, basically disappearing below the water so.",
    "On their own layer, we're going to add a bunch of rocks here.",
    "What I'm doing is making a creating a like a Dome shape and then holding shift and using my eraser to erase out, whoops, wrong.",
    "Actually go to the eraser using my eraser to erase out the bottom.",
    "So let me do it up here so that it makes sense so you can see it more clearly will do big one.",
    "So making like a Dome shaped like this then hold shift.",
    "And erase out the bottom.",
    "So then we have a nice flat edge down there.",
    "That's the fastest way I think to do this.",
    "Or you can use the lasso tool to make a selection, but sometimes it racing back into shape is really handy, especially because it's kind of nice if use a textured eraser and in this case.",
    "Don't erase out everything but kind of do something like this.",
    "That's kind of cool.",
    "'cause then when you fit that into the water, it just looks like there's a little bit of water coming up over the Rock You know?",
    "So I think that's nice rather than a perfectly to make it look like there's a little splash or something by erasing out.",
    "So it's really fun to think about how you can use your eraser like this.",
    "Sometimes it's hard to paint these creative shapes with the just with the brush, but if you paint the shape and erase out you can come up with something more interesting.",
    "We got a bunch of little rocks here and I'm also just considering the shape right now.",
    "I'm not even thinking about color because it's on its own layer.",
    "It's going to be really easy to change the colors of these with the clipping mask or just lock the transparency in paint on top of it.",
    "So for example, you can press this button up here.",
    "The checkerboard button.",
    "This will lock the layer transparency so that what that means is the only area that I'm going to be able to paint on is the area of already painted on, which is the shape of these rocks so I can choose a lighter color.",
    "And then go right on top like this and the color I'm painting it is only going to affect.",
    "Within that rock shape, so it's really easy to paint in the lines you know I can just take any color and add a little bit of a highlight, and I don't even have to be precise about it, 'cause it's not going to go out of the lines and you just pop in a little highlight.",
    "So that's that.",
    "Now these rocks are a little bit bigger than in the reference.",
    "Then I'm actually I would be happy about that.",
    "So I still want it to look.",
    "Somewhat realistic in that you see this scene, you can tell what it is and what's going on, and you know these are flower pots and windows and doors and trees.",
    "You know we want to have that level of.",
    "Realism that you can understand the scene, but other than that I'm happy if it looks more like a painting and it's OK for us to see individual brush strokes and.",
    "For stuff not to be super, super precisely painted.",
    "And maybe we can add some little things like it's trial and error, but maybe you had like a little pot down here.",
    "You know we could add or take away things.",
    "We don't have to follow the reference exactly.",
    "We might be able to make some changes that improve it based on our tastes.",
    "Hi Isabella, welcome.",
    "How are you doing?",
    "Little pot here.",
    "And it's starting to look cute.",
    "Flower pots always make a scene nice and cheerful.",
    "Hi Everson.",
    "How are you?",
    "OK, so we've got our furthest flower pots now there's another flower over on the side which I think we don't really see.",
    "The pot we just kind of see a plant coming in from from the side.",
    "I think that's fine.",
    "Nice, I'm glad you could join us.",
    "Let's see the difference between this and this.",
    "I think is enough, will make a new layer.",
    "I'm trying to keep some things on different layers so I can kind of create a little step by step from this.",
    "So I think it's going OK.",
    "So let's get some more yellow green leaves over here.",
    "See if I can give this plan to more specific shape.",
    "I really like in the reference how you can tell the individual little branches reaching out an.",
    "Kind of dispersing.",
    "There's also a window back there.",
    "I probably should paint that window in before we cover it with plants.",
    "It's a pretty one.",
    "More of a red color.",
    "OK, so you guys might know this already, but in case you don't this is a fun, very useful trick if you hold if you make a dot and then you hold shift and make another dot it will make a straight line between those two dots.",
    "So that's one way to make up for me to make a nice precise shape for this window back here.",
    "If I feel like I can't draw a perfectly straight line.",
    "And then.",
    "Can go back in and.",
    "Paint normally.",
    "Might lower the opacity a little bit so it fits in better.",
    "Seems a little bit dark and was attracting my attention very much.",
    "Kinda just wanted to be a nice little background detail.",
    "I think maybe I made it too big.",
    "This is the advantage of doing things on separate layers.",
    "Even though I want the painterly approach, it's nice to be able to just quickly fix that and not have it have been painted right on.",
    "2.",
    "The wall let's put this.",
    "And I like that detail outside of the window too.",
    "Gotta be careful getting into these details, but let's do it.",
    "Going to Trader.",
    "Draw straight line so it comes something like this.",
    "OK, it's not.",
    "Exactly.",
    "But I like it.",
    "We can decide if we like that.",
    "You know we have freedoms in our work.",
    "You can have artistic license.",
    "We don't have to do everything exactly like the reference.",
    "I'm just trying to learn about the.",
    "The colors in the mood basically is what I'm trying to take from this reference, but we can make changes to little things.",
    "I'd like to get more brave with taking making changes, but I want to find the balance because if I let myself go, if I let me get myself go off too much, then I don't think I'll be learning as much from the reference.",
    "I still have a lot to learn and I want to keep learning about colors and shapes of things, and so I think if I go too far off the reference then I'm more referencing my own ideas in my head and less of a study where I'm learning from what you see here in front of us.",
    "So trying to find balance.",
    "Thank you, thanks machiavelli, I'm glad you think so.",
    "I'm happy with it so far.",
    "I think I'm going to merge down these rocks.",
    "Let's do it.",
    "So we're back.",
    "I want to get us back to our background layer and then everything else here on top of it.",
    "And then we start again with a new layer, keep going.",
    "I think it'll be fun to put little splashes in the water, so I haven't zoomed in yet on my reference.",
    "I do have it full screen.",
    "Oh yeah, that's what I'm missing.",
    "Pure ref.",
    "OK, be rough is back.",
    "So I have my reference full screen next to, well, not quite full screen but larger version next to chat so I can see that, but at some point I might actually zoom in on that so we can see some little more little details and.",
    "We need to.",
    "Thank you Sathish, thank you.",
    "Appreciate it.",
    "I'm surprised actually.",
    "I thought earlier on I was going to want to come back and do a lot more to the mountain.",
    "But I think it's kind of cool the way it looks.",
    "Maybe I'll leave it loose like that.",
    "We're going to keep painting the stuff closer to us first, 'cause That's a little bit more important to look cleaner stuff a little bit closer to us.",
    "And then we'll decide if we want to do more on that mountain back there or not.",
    "There's one thing I'm noticing in the reference, and that is a pretty dark line.",
    "Like a Ridge of foliage that's a little bit darker.",
    "Back here and then later coming towards us.",
    "and I have that going on in mind, but I think it could be a little stronger so want to bring this.",
    "Dark shadow down here.",
    "Especially at the bottom of each of these, Bush is and things it tends to start out in Shadow and then come up and the tops of the Bushes are reaching out into the light a little bit.",
    "I'm going to make a selection over here because I want to use it as a stencil for myself.",
    "And make a selection of the area that I want to be able to paint with in and then I can just go like this.",
    "And have these grass is come up from in between these rocks here and I don't want to have to worry about.",
    "The bottom edge being clean.",
    "Ryan Oh my God.",
    "Hey Ryan, how are you guys?",
    "Don't be alarmed, Ryan is kidding.",
    "Oh That's.",
    "I hope you're doing good.",
    "I want to say that before anyone starts yelling at you in the chat.",
    "I think the amount looks great, maybe more detailed their River compared to the mountain.",
    "I think you're right, the River needs the River needs to really feel crisp, at least in one area at least.",
    "Maybe here where it's like the focal area we need more crisp details in the water and then the rest can be slightly looser and we can get away with it I think.",
    "But I like that idea.",
    "OK, so let's do it.",
    "Whoops, wrong brush.",
    "That'll work.",
    "That'll work.",
    "So because that's on its own layer, we can do our lock transparency and grab another color and give a little bit of.",
    "Highlight or shading to make this more 3 dimensional.",
    "If you see fit, I think in the reference it's a little bit.",
    "Lighter in some areas so.",
    "Works for me.",
    "The last thing is, there's a little bit of like an iron bar going across the window, and it has a nice little pattern to it.",
    "So let's see if we can get that in.",
    "And it's got some larger bars it split into thirds.",
    "And then within that.",
    "Thinner ones.",
    "To try to find the right amounts, I don't want to cover it completely with bars.",
    "Yeah, that's OK.",
    "So we can go to image, adjust Hue, saturation.",
    "I think I want to lighten this or give it a little bit of a different color.",
    "Unlock the transparency and go back in with some shadows.",
    "To make it look a little bit more 3D.",
    "OK, so I think I'm going to merge those together and just commit to it and will go on so.",
    "Let's do it.",
    "It's part of the wall.",
    "Now you guys.",
    "It's not perfectly even, but it's OK.",
    "It's an old building.",
    "Things can be, some things can be in an even.",
    "From now on, I'll be able to just pay on top of that.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Hi Satish, thank you very much.",
    "So I know this particular scene has a lot of detail, is a bit of a complicated one, but not all the scenes that I paint on the stream are have so much going on.",
    "You guys are always welcome to paint with me.",
    "If you feel like this one is a bit much, maybe maybe next Wednesday would be a can pick something a little less.",
    "Detailed.",
    "But I was enjoy happy guys painting and sketching with me, so you're welcome to join if you want.",
    "Anytime.",
    "I think season thank you.",
    "Realistically, this plant is kind of coming from the side.",
    "Really bro near that is such an honor.",
    "Thank you, thank you for being here.",
    "Thank you for like making an effort to be here.",
    "That's really nice to hear.",
    "I appreciate the company.",
    "It's nice to hang out with you guys, find it very relaxing to do these and a fun puzzle to figure out how to.",
    "How to illustrate them.",
    "I've been working on experimenting with some different stylization for my cell phone.",
    "It's kind of a little bit new to me over the past months trying to explore the kind of traditional painting style with my digital work, so it's taking a lot of trial and error testing out different things and.",
    "Yeah, it's nice to talk about it and think about it and hang out with you guys and I'm happy to like teach my approach.",
    "But it's also a little trial and error as I go through here, so it's not always a linear teaching.",
    "But you can always ask me if you have any questions about what I'm doing.",
    "I don't know if I like what I did.",
    "There might erase out a little bit.",
    "We'll come back to it.",
    "So I want to work on the floor a little bit.",
    "The ground.",
    "Right now it feels like the trees are just.",
    "Coming out of nowhere it that we need to give a little home for the trees we need to give them a nice little place to come out of the ground so it feels more planted.",
    "It feels more.",
    "Believable So it looks like they're coming out of these tiny little openings.",
    "Little squares in the floor.",
    "It's not a big space for them to come out of, but I guess it's enough.",
    "So.",
    "Can see little opening.",
    "Look at that.",
    "It makes such a difference, but beyond that the whole floor also needs a little bit more love, so there's sort of crisscross pattern.",
    "I like using flat brushes for.",
    "These are grass is and things and this is the same thing with the traditional.",
    "I also like to do this if you've got grass is growing like out of the ground using these types of brushes is a really easy way to block them in like that so.",
    "Yeah it is.",
    "It is already one almost two o'clock here in the Netherlands.",
    "Yeah, we just had our time change so.",
    "We are now.",
    "Ahead of one more hour from.",
    "EST time zone.",
    "Which is sad for me since my family mostly lives in EST, but.",
    "That's OK.",
    "We're getting used to it.",
    "You can have some little more little Tufts of green here.",
    "In between these rocks.",
    "Trying to be brave at this flatbread 'cause it's pretty bold shapes that's making, although it doesn't help us to make strong shapes, it's kind of hard to.",
    "Avoid it when you're using a brush like this.",
    "OK, so let's work on this little area of land coming out into the water and the.",
    "The water itself too.",
    "I think you actually where is this?",
    "It might say it on the end splash page.",
    "Let's take a look at the original post.",
    "Odds ion its Zion National Park.",
    "This shouldn't surprise me.",
    "This is I have to visit this place someday.",
    "Is the original photographers post on unsplash Kevin and go?",
    "Yeah, I absolutely love any pictures that I've seen from Zion National Park.",
    "I hope I can visit there someday.",
    "I've painted a few different.",
    "Landscapes from this park.",
    "Only from photos though.",
    "But one day I'll visit.",
    "Yeah, yeah, it's a famous one.",
    "Maybe a lot.",
    "It maybe guys recognized that I should have guessed that.",
    "That's absolutely beautiful.",

    "I've made them free to use so you don't have to worry about.",
    "Infringing And use them for studies.",
    "Yeah, we're getting there cleaning up cleaning up over here.",
    "All right, what can we do with the water?",
    "I think I'm actually going to zoom in finally.",
    "Utah and USB seen beautiful sort of stuff nearby at Arches National Park.",
    "That's a good recommendation.",
    "Clever, maybe I can look up some images from there too.",
    "Did you prank owl this morning?",
    "No, I didn't.",
    "I'm not much of a prankster to be honest like I.",
    "I don't know if I've ever done any April fools pranks.",
    "Maybe when I was a kid.",
    "Yeah, I'm a little boring when it comes to that stuff.",
    "And I like to scare people.",
    "Think I've actually been in or near this stream to be honest, just start doing the study.",
    "This photo will see how it turns out.",
    "Nice ramen, good luck.",
    "OK.",
    "Have fun with it and if you need more time, don't worry about taking.",
    "You know.",
    "Don't worry about trying to keep up with me, 'cause I've obviously got quite a Head Start here, so take your time.",
    "And I don't know if that's gonna be too busy to busy and to kind of technical to get into.",
    "Maybe we can just give like a texture.",
    "To the floor without going so precise with the exact Criss cross pattern that exists there.",
    "Stephanie says, do you ever have moments where you'd stare at a painting for minutes on end and try to figure out what to do next?",
    "Your painting so fluently.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Thank you.",
    "I definitely feel that sometimes every once in awhile I'll do it on stream too, but.",
    "I do know exactly what you're talking about, so for me more often like as I practice more and more, I feel like I get less of those moments, at least when I'm painting from.",
    "From reference when I'm painting from reference, I get less of those moments because I feel like if I get when I look at the image, it gives me a lot more like OK.",
    "I need to work on that part.",
    "I kind of.",
    "It's like it's like I can see it helps me see what to do next.",
    "But when I'm painting an original scene and usually even wanna making original, senile have like an accumulation of references, I'll have a like a mood board or a reference board with multiple different ones.",
    "And then you know, so I'm still using reference, but.",
    "I'm not, I'm kind of creating a new thing from those instead of.",
    "Recreating something that exists and those way more often get me into that situation where I'm like I can't visualize what am I doing next and I get like stuck a little bit and sometimes have to take a break, come back to it later and stuff like that.",
    "So yeah, it depends on the type of illustration I'm doing when I'm doing studies and things I don't find it quite as problematic.",
    "Usually when I'm working from one specific reference it's easier for me to follow.",
    "Definitely make streaming quite stressful for me.",
    "Yeah, I get that you can always.",
    "You can always ask chat you know like sometimes I'll be stuck and I'll say like, what do you guys think that can be?",
    "That can be also that can backfire because sometimes then you'll get like 20 suggestions at once, and that can also be confusing, but chat is definitely giving me some good.",
    "Suggestions before when I've been stuck, so as long as you get a few good suggestions and not like 50 then it's good.",
    "Then it can help.",
    "Reassuring awesome.",
    "Yes, definitely definitely.",
    "Um, let's see.",
    "I think viewers wouldn't mind, especially if you narrate your thoughts.",
    "That's a really good point hunji, like even when I do get confused, I tend to.",
    "I tend to talk about why I'm confused.",
    "You are really confused right now.",
    "I can't decide what to do here there and that's still an interesting part of the process for people, I think.",
    "I can find it interesting when I'm watching an artist to see like what they're struggling with and then how they kind of think through it.",
    "So that's a good point.",
    "Just talking about it.",
    "PC and says well for me it's like Instagram.",
    "If the viewers of board there free to go instead of thinking.",
    "Jeez, I'm doing nothing.",
    "People will get bored.",
    "You can see it as people who have POV help you figure out your next move.",
    "Yeah, yeah, that's a good point.",
    "Not stress too much about it.",
    "It's hard sometimes not to stress or overthink things, but.",
    "You're probably right.",
    "Hey Andy, how are you?",
    "Yeah, so I like this effect.",
    "I'm getting from the.",
    "Ground with putting just a little bit of Kris Kross kind, it's extra.",
    "I hope it's helping to look like these.",
    "This pattern, but without getting too obsessed with it.",
    "Hi, a sling more.",
    "Happy Wednesday.",
    "OK.",
    "So there is one thing that might be good to pay attention to, and that is as we as this pattern from the on the sidewalk or on the ground gets closer and closer to us.",
    "It does get bigger and the panels in it get thicker and that helps show like distance and perspective because you know farther away all the way.",
    "Over here we don't see that kind of detail, so I think that's helpful for someone looking at this.",
    "Our viewers looking at our painting, it's going to make more sense if we allow that detailed to be.",
    "So I want to put some little darker shadows in the water ripples.",
    "Near the rocks to make it look a little more convincing.",
    "Like there.",
    "Infecting the environments around them like there's some shadows because of them.",
    "April 1st has been canceled this year, right?",
    "My heart can't take it.",
    "I can't take it.",
    "Oh my gosh, yeah, I'm glad your wife stepped in on that one.",
    "Brian.",
    "Two cruel.",
    "Too cruel.",
    "Oh Oh my gosh.",
    "After that, they're never going to listen to you going back to school every time they're going to be like.",
    "Do we believe it?",
    "Can you believe it?",
    "Alright, darkening up the shadow on the left.",
    "So I think the shadow is really important.",
    "This is a shadow, but it's also reflection in the water of all these trees which are in shadow is part of what we get all these dark.",
    "Dark colors in the water over here.",
    "I like to use a lot of horizontal and vertical strokes to in water to give this shiny and.",
    "Reflective look.",
    "So even when I'm not really seeing it there in the water, in this scene a ton, I've painted a lot of water scenes where I've seen this happen, so I know that.",
    "It kind of works.",
    "There's one thing that's one benefit of painting a lot of.",
    "Studies is that sometimes you start to learn certain patterns, and even if you're painting a scene where that particular thing isn't happening there you've painted enough similar scenes to say, OK, well, I can still use this technique.",
    "I've learned it from other scenes, and I know that it will work here, and it might look cool, you know, so I can paint these kind of vertical.",
    "Vertical paint strokes in here and I think it will work.",
    "Painting is witchcraft.",
    "Hey Pavlos, there does seem like there's some magic involved.",
    "Alright, turn that on and off.",
    "Make sure we're going in the right direction, and I think overall, yes.",
    "Let me flip this too 'cause it might be a little annoying to see that going the opposite direction.",
    "I'm going to still bring some of these.",
    "Darker Blue Green.",
    "Shadows.",
    "Kind of indicate these ripples.",
    "There's a lot of detail in the water.",
    "I'm not going for photo realism.",
    "Then I would lose my mind in this one.",
    "So we're just trying to get the the overall effect in a hopefully simpler way illustrating it.",
    "But there's all these little.",
    "Ripples and splashes and things are going to start getting some of these in there.",
    "Hey.",
    "Hey your friends.",
    "How are you?",
    "We're doing good here.",
    "Painting one of my favorite types of environments, so I'm happy.",
    "When I.",
    "Trader",
    "Put a little bit of texture in the water here to make it look like these little bubbles and ripples and things.",
    "Less and less as it gets further away.",
    "OK, I almost forgot that my trees were on a second layer.",
    "I'm like carefully avoiding them, but I can just paint underneath.",
    "Hi, I'm above thank you.",
    "Thank you for saying that you're very guys are very sweet.",
    "I appreciate you hanging out with me and all the nice comments and.",
    "Yeah, thank you for being here.",
    "I haven't even begun with the table and chairs, so that's a little example of me procrastinating.",
    "I think at some point I need to paint them in.",
    "There's also a bicycle.",
    "Those are going to be a little complicated for me.",
    "I think I do want to paint the area around behind and underneath first, but I think we're getting to the point where it's time to start painting that in.",
    "So.",
    "I'm trying to keep a little record of the process so this is what we've done so far.",
    "Is there so many layers for you?",
    "Well, I'm only keeping these layers so that I can make a little process thing later.",
    "I'm not actively using all of these so these are just layers of the progress of the painting I've been saving the past ones for reference to show later.",
    "But at the moment I'm actually using two to three layers for my painting.",
    "Yeah here let me show you the let me show you the bicycle.",
    "There it is.",
    "I wonder I might not include the bicycle my painting.",
    "I think the focal point of the.",
    "Table and chairs.",
    "Hundreds like I don't see what I don't see one either.",
    "I think the table and chairs are nice focal point.",
    "The bicycle is partially covered by the chair and the.",
    "I I don't think it's perfect.",
    "I don't think it's perfect.",
    "If anything, if I were going to redesign this, it might be nice if the bicycle was like on one of these trees back here.",
    "It's a little cluttered over here.",
    "So I think I'm just going to go with the.",
    "Like either the table and chair evil, either just the bicycle or just the table and chairs, and I think the table and chairs are going to look nicer.",
    "I don't know if you're the one to ask this, but is there a vacancy on this street?",
    "Made out of cake with your painting, I want to move there.",
    "I know I'm ready to go on vacation to this place.",
    "I it's in Spain.",
    "And Yeah, it looks beautiful.",
    "Yeah, yeah, we're going to do we're on the same page.",
    "Angie, we're on the same page.",
    "Well, that's good to hear.",
    "So you agree.",
    "Alright, well let's.",
    "Let's begin with the blocking in the table and chairs.",
    "Actually, you know what I'm going to procrastinate even more.",
    "But this is actually needed.",
    "There's I want to get the lighting working below here before we put the table and chairs, because if you guys can see the table and chairs, most of it is a silhouette.",
    "So the IT needs to have this pretty bright light on the wall behind it and then even some bounce light on the floor underneath the chairs.",
    "This is also blowing a lot an I think it helps to show the table and chairs because then they look very dark compared to the.",
    "The background and without that being dark.",
    "Yeah, it's not going to make their shape pop out as much.",
    "Wow, that is impressive.",
    "We'll see how that goes.",
    "There's a lot of this, like disruption in the water.",
    "And that's also pretty because you get that contrast between the areas where there's a lot of like ripples in bubbles and then the area where it's a little bit more glassy and smooth and shiny.",
    "So I think that's pretty contrast.",
    "Maybe it takes a little more time.",
    "It's too much.",
    "Do we like it?",
    "I don't know yet.",
    "I don't know yet.",
    "I can't murder down yet I'm not convinced.",
    "Add some more highlights, so going back and forth with highlights and shadows.",
    "Bring back some of the pink Oh yeah, I can move this back now.",
    "Sometimes it's nice to zoom out.",
    "Yeah, you can see the difference in what's going on with mine and the reference.",
    "So I need to bring some.",
    "From the highlights out here.",
    "I've sort of.",
    "Organize all my highlights in the center.",
    "Really, this whole area needs more brightness based on what I'm seeing when I zoom out because a lot more clear to compare mine to the reference.",
    "With tablet, are you using of Centriq 13 HD and it's cool, but it feels so slippery like have a lot more control when I'm sketching on paper then of honest antique.",
    "So I am using the Wakeham Centriq 22 and I I do know what you're talking about.",
    "I'm personally I'm happy with the 22, but I feel like overtime this antique.",
    "They have been improving the feeling of the tablet, my.",
    "Previous tablet I had the 2424 HD an I felt like that surface was a very very smooth and it took me along time to get used to it.",
    "I mean I love the tablet.",
    "It was a nice big screen and I'm not complaining but yeah it was a difficult at the beginning because of how slippery it was and I was coming from traditional painting so I was.",
    "Definitely not used to that type of difference from paper to the slippery screen, but I think that there are improving overtime because now I have the new 22 and it feels a lot better.",
    "It's a lot less slippery and more a little bit more.",
    "Matt, a little bit more like saten for lack of better explanation, but it's still not quite like paper, but I like the surface on this one.",
    "So that might be something that's slowly improving.",
    "You might be able to buy some kind of.",
    "She, like a protective sheet to put on top.",
    "I'm not sure I've heard of those for like the iPad.",
    "I don't know if there's one person teak or not, but you might be able to buy something that goes on top that adds more texture.",
    "But I'm sorry that it's feeling slippery and then not super happy with it and he's a good tablet.",
    "The 13 HD is a good tablet, but I.",
    "Think.",
    "Yeah, a lot of the tablets suffer from that a bit.",
    "I don't think the technology with any of the tablets is quite to the point where it's like exactly like paper, but it might eventually be there, but it's getting closer.",
    "It's getting getting overall getting better as time goes on.",
    "So I'm adding little highlights to the foliage back here.",
    "Right now we've got a big mass of darker green, but I'm trying to add little.",
    "Little circular Tufts and things to show.",
    "Light hitting and different branches.",
    "Jasper says added a piece of paper on top of into Uspro gives it more grip.",
    "That's cool.",
    "I mean, especially if you don't.",
    "If you're using a tablet that doesn't have a screen, you don't.",
    "You can just put a piece of paper and it's not like it's blocking you from seeing anything so.",
    "That is impressive.",
    "Stephanie.",
    "I don't know if I would have picked that out.",
    "I think I might have guessed like Italy or something if I was.",
    "If I was going to guess, I would've probably been wrong.",
    "Well, I would have definitely been more so there you have it, but I also haven't been to Spain so I maybe if I had been there before I would have.",
    "Been more likely to.",
    "To recognize it, have you been in Istanbul?",
    "I never have more near.",
    "Maybe someday.",
    "Well, the the.",
    "The ground in my painting seems almost as if it's on a curve.",
    "But maybe that's fine.",
    "'cause this is a very old place.",
    "Old buildings.",
    "They can be.",
    "Things can be a little crooked, right?",
    "All right, so we're cleaning up a nice backdrop for our table and chairs to come in.",
    "I think we're almost ready for it.",
    "OK.",
    "Ah, I can't.",
    "We're saying about the bicycle.",
    "But hey, you can always use it in your painting if you if you do one of the scene.",
    "One of the things that I find interesting when we do these group studies and multiple people paint along is that.",
    "Different people leave different things out.",
    "Different people focus on different things in the image, something that's like a really key thing to another person is less important.",
    "And that's an interesting thing.",
    "The entire artist interpretation.",
    "If we have extra time, we can consider adding the bicycle, but.",
    "To me it's less important than the other things.",
    "To me, and there's a lot going on in this scene.",
    "Very busy, so I'm going to prioritize the other things first, and then maybe we can add the bike.",
    "Alright, so we have one chair.",
    "Table.",
    "So pro designer, if you open the link below this stream the.",
    "The photographer did tagged this as Santa Cruz.",
    "But I don't know if there's a more specific location.",
    "I don't know if you're looking for more specific about like the exact like cafe or something like that.",
    "I don't know if we're going to know.",
    "We're going to know that specifically, but the photographer I gave a good amount of location information there.",
    "I have not been to India.",
    "I've been too well.",
    "I'm from the United States.",
    "I've been to I live in the Netherlands and I've been to Belgium, Germany and.",
    "Italy, but other than that I haven't been through.",
    "Many haven't been to other countries.",
    "I've been to Canada.",
    "But yeah, I would love to do more world traveling.",
    "In the future.",
    "Hi Marissa, how are you?",
    "So there's two tables next to each other, so we're going to get.",
    "Drinking in both in there.",
    "I'm going to put them closer together.",
    "I think I might actually turn on smoothing on my brush.",
    "I feel like I'm making very.",
    "Wobbly brushstrokes right now.",
    "With these little details.",
    "I'm going to try to stay pretty relaxed about these details on painting in right now.",
    "I imagine that you might use up your nibs a little bit more quickly, but.",
    "It might be worth it if the painting is that much more.",
    "Comfortable.",
    "Yeah.",
    "That makes sense.",
    "All right, so we're getting closer to finishing this one.",
    "Not quite there yet, but we're getting there.",
    "I'm going to make a new layer in between the background and everything else, but the layer an overlay and grab an airbrush.",
    "I want to experiment with like warming up the Sky just a little bit, actually maybe overlays in the right color.",
    "Be ready, just need to go right in and paint it on normal because it's already really great, but I want a little bit of a warmer Sky.",
    "You see the before and after 4 after.",
    "That works on the interest on it as well.",
    "Thanks.",
    "Like a good trick.",
    "So here's what I was talking about earlier regarding adjustment layers and things.",
    "I'm going to bring my layers pile out here so you can see 'cause I think it was going behind my.",
    "Webcam, so when I get to a certain point in the process, especially like basically near the end, I like to use adjustment layers to modify things a little bit and.",
    "Uh.",
    "Maybe tweak colors a little little bit before I paint the final details on.",
    "Thank you Jasper, thanks, appreciate that.",
    "I'm going to make a new layer and go to image, apply image and just this creates emerged version of everything below.",
    "So it's basically the Sky and everything else is together.",
    "So I'm going to use the adjustment layer.",
    "So I'm going to go to the half circle here and we can go through some of these and take a look at what we can do with them.",
    "So let's try levels first levels helps with your values, the darks and lights so you can go through shadows.",
    "Midtones and highlights and adjust the different brightnesses.",
    "Maybe you find that this can help push the mood more.",
    "Thank you, Papa Lowe's.",
    "Gaussian hi there.",
    "Sometimes I end up adding a little bit more contrast in this step.",
    "But it's just to play around with and I like to just play around with it and see if there's anything I can do to improve things.",
    "I also like to go through color balance.",
    "And go through The Shadows, Midtones and highlights, and just kind of play around.",
    "This is something that I do almost every time, whether I think the painting needs it or not.",
    "Sometimes you can find different ways to make it better.",
    "So do we want more of a green cast?",
    "What about more weapon genta?",
    "I think the magenta is more Moody, but you don't always have to change.",
    "You don't have to change anything.",
    "Blue and green.",
    "I prefer not to change anything there.",
    "Let's try midtones.",
    "The nice thing is that this is not destructive, it's on a separate.",
    "It's an adjustment layer so you can go back and either lower the opacity you can mask out these adjustments, or you can just get rid of them completely.",
    "You can tell them down, you don't have to.",
    "Be stuck with what you do here.",
    "Let's try highlights finally.",
    "Like look how different you can make this mood.",
    "I don't really like any of that anyway, but sometimes sometimes these can really save you if you're struggling to.",
    "You're struggling to.",
    "Get a certain mood.",
    "Sometimes you can find the answer here with adjustment layers.",
    "So after doing a bunch of stuff, I'll turn the layer on and off, so this is before, after, before, after, and see if I like the adjustment, 'cause sometimes I won't.",
    "In this case I'm going to lower the opacity of it and just have a little bit of a little bit of a showing through.",
    "This is before and after of those two little bit more.",
    "And I do want everything to look believable enough, so I don't want anything to be super super wonky, but I'm going to try to stay loose and be OK with the fact that this is going to be again.",
    "I'm were considered more concerned with the mood in the lighting in the scene rather than things being like super, super realistic.",
    "I wanted to look like a painting.",
    "So not not going for photo realism.",
    "I want to try again at the second table.",
    "I notice that I made them look too too matchy.",
    "Matchy couldn't give a slightly different angle to this one I think so they don't look so identical.",
    "That's a little better.",
    "At least there's a little more space between them.",
    "Alright, the tables are really pretty, they have.",
    "And this shine.",
    "You can see the.",
    "Reflection of light on the top of the tables.",
    "So I want to get that affect in mind too, so I'm going to finish them off.",
    "And then we'll add a little highlight.",
    "Hopefully it will be.",
    "Satisfying, I find highlights like some of the most fun of the whole painting process.",
    "OK, so we've got our tables.",
    "We can lock the transparency with the checkerboard icon and pick a darker Brown and add a little bit of shadow like underneath the top of the table that first.",
    "Maybe a little bit of shadow right there, so it's a little darker right underneath the very top.",
    "And also.",
    "We can give some shading to the individual legs if we want.",
    "It would be so nice, Susan, I would really go for that right now sitting at one of these tables having a cup of coffee, reading a book or chatting or sketching or just sitting and enjoying the beautiful location.",
    "That would definitely love that.",
    "It's one of the reasons I like painting places like this is.",
    "It's a big.",
    "Painting relaxing scenes if they just make me feel good to look at and.",
    "Yeah, they make me happy to paint and give a lot of good vibes.",
    "I hope you know as an artist and I also make traditional art and soul.",
    "My traditional paintings and I hope when people buy my artwork and have it in there.",
    "In their home that it makes them feel happy and gives those kind of feelings of like remembering being an application somewhere or just some nice feeling like that's what I like in, uh, there's different purposes to artwork.",
    "Sometimes you make art because it's you know.",
    "Artwork can be advertising.",
    "Artwork can be.",
    "You can be giving a message with your art.",
    "There's so many different things, but for me a lot of what I like to do with my art is just create pieces that give good feeling and make people feel happy when they see them.",
    "And so I like landscapes with a nice feeling and sometimes with like a nastalgic feeling, nice lighting and things like that.",
    "This is what I'm attracted to when I make art.",
    "Four months of winter here.",
    "Until we have a nice sitting out weather.",
    "Ryan, you guys are really got a ways to go.",
    "Still four months I think here in here in the Netherlands it's getting warmer.",
    "I think it'll be another month or two before it's like.",
    "Warm But it's already.",
    "It's already improving slightly.",
    "High paying welcome.",
    "Pretty sure it's in front of the Legato Alcazar Hotel.",
    "How did you find that?",
    "Oh my gosh, it would be so cool to go stay there after having painted this already that would be wild.",
    "I could actually do a painting there in person.",
    "Maybe someday.",
    "Maybe someday it's a future.",
    "Future travel destination.",
    "Cool well I don't know how you found it or if you've been there but.",
    "Thanks for sharing.",
    "Wow, really Marissa?",
    "Is that unusual for this time of year?",
    "That sounds really intense.",
    "It's getting colder here in Edinburg, oh.",
    "I I felt a little bit of that here in the Netherlands, like we had a very strange January which was really warmer than usual and felt like we were already going right into spring and then it did get colder again and I was like, no, you're going the wrong way.",
    "Contrast.",
    "And finally, selective color is something that I use a fair amount.",
    "It's super super powerful.",
    "When I first discovered slipped selective color, it kind of blew my mind so you can select your color here that you want to play with and basically go through these sliders and it's going to only alter the colors in this range like the Reds.",
    "So now I can decide, do I want more or less cyan in my reads in the Reds?",
    "Tone, so you can really, really change things.",
    "And then the magenta is.",
    "I mean, look at this difference.",
    "And this is without going back and re painting stuff and you can totally change the mood.",
    "So I like them or orange.",
    "So we're going to add some yellow.",
    "And then that you can change the values, darks and lights of this.",
    "So that feels good.",
    "So if I show the before and after there before after it's been more saturated and you can go through another selective color.",
    "Or you can do it all on the one layer.",
    "And you don't have to go through all these, but you know sometimes it's fun to do.",
    "It had more of a glow.",
    "What about the greens?",
    "I think playing with things like this can really really spark some creativity, because you maybe there's a color scheme that you wouldn't naturally think of.",
    "But through playing with these adjustment layers and things you can come up with something interesting and maybe yeah, maybe it opens you up to a new style even.",
    "Look at that.",
    "OK, so let's.",
    "Look at the before and after.",
    "I was kind of going through those really quickly so.",
    "Will keep a little bit of the adjustments, but we can.",
    "Move this layer up to see the before and after all of the adjustments so this.",
    "Yeah, this is before.",
    "Hold on, let me do this properly.",
    "Play image.",
    "Yeah, so this would be like before and after 4 after.",
    "It's actually not like a huge.",
    "Huge change.",
    "I've gone through more extreme changes with these, but it's definitely.",
    "Definitely bit warmer.",
    "So I'm going to get rid of the adjustment layers.",
    "Technically, you might want to keep those if you want the ability to paint in a non destructive manner.",
    "I just wanted to show how they worked.",
    "I don't really need to have all those layers around.",
    "Hi Rick, welcome welcome welcome.",
    "I'll put this back over here.",
    "So there's some other things that I like to do in the finishing steps.",
    "I make a new layer and put it on multiply and this isn't in every scene, but I think it'll work in this one.",
    "I'm going to choose a warm color, maybe this warm Brown or warm purple would actually be nice.",
    "And I'm going to use the airbrush to make sort of a vig net around the outside.",
    "Of the scene.",
    "Now this is a little bit too heavy, but I just wanted to be able to see what I was doing and show you guys, but I usually go pretty heavy on it and then erase out and lower the Opacity until it's like at a level that I like.",
    "So just a little bit like this, you really don't want it to look like you've done anything but it just kind of helps focus the viewers.",
    "I more towards the centre or more towards the focal areas rather than the outside so just darkening outside a little bit.",
    "And.",
    "The opposite would be bringing more light towards the.",
    "The focal area so we can put a layer on color Dodge.",
    "I'm going to double click.",
    "We're going to uncheck transparency shapes layer.",
    "If you uncheck this, it changes how color dog behaves just a little bit an I'd like the effect more.",
    "It's a little bit more saturated.",
    "I think it just effects the colors a little bit.",
    "All thank you Rick, thanks.",
    "So I want to choose a warm orangey yellow color and.",
    "We're going to put a nice Big Airbrush and put this glow behind the.",
    "Foliage on everything back there.",
    "And Yeah, it's over exposing a little bit.",
    "But Now it seems like.",
    "Going getting a little warmer again.",
    "Yeah, I can understand that right?",
    "Everyone's like getting in their bathing suits.",
    "Wow, that is intense.",
    "So I'm adding a little bit more shading underneath the.",
    "Table and chairs.",
    "There's going to be shadows right below each individual little foot and stuff like that.",
    "So we can put these little marks.",
    "Also, there's another chair, so I shouldn't be getting too carried away.",
    "I might have to move things.",
    "Don't know what the norm is.",
    "I've only been in Austin for six months.",
    "Oh, I see move from Indiana.",
    "Well, I hope you're liking it.",
    "I lived in Florida for most of my life, so I was used to it being pretty hot alot of the year and not having two too much in the way of seasons.",
    "It sounds like it's pretty pretty warm where you are too.",
    "There can be advantages and disadvantages to that.",
    "I definitely miss.",
    "A higher average of sunny days.",
    "There's a lot of cloudy and rainy days where I live now in comparison.",
    "Sometimes I.",
    "Sometimes I get a little tired of it, sometimes it can be cozy, but.",
    "After a while you want to see the sun.",
    "I haven't used fresco, Steven.",
    "I've I've heard some good things about it, and I've seen some really nice art created in the program.",
    "I like that I really like the idea of the traditional texture, since that's something that I'm really trying to get in my work.",
    "But yeah, just haven't tried it yet.",
    "I have a bunch of.",
    "I feel like.",
    "I have enough on my hands at the moment.",
    "Maybe it maybe at some point if I start to feel at all like stale with what I'm doing then I like to mix it up trying a new medium or new.",
    "New technique or something like that, but at the moment the flick I've got a lot on my hands as part of the reason I haven't tried fresco yet.",
    "Sadly, we do jump from a very warm spring, so hot summer.",
    "Trying to remember which what's on what layer we're going to have to merge soon, so too many layers for my liking, but I feel like it's a lot easier to paint this what I'm doing it right now.",
    "If I keep things separate temporarily until the chairs blocked in everything is blocked in then will merge it all.",
    "Mr.",
    "Since during the winter I have the Heat in Texas, I just got a dog being able to take her on walks every day.",
    "It's been really nice not looking forward to the summer though.",
    "Yeah, that's going to be really warm.",
    "Yeah, that was the same for me.",
    "Was that most of the time the Florida weather in the winter is pretty nice.",
    "Like cool like warm but with some cool breeze, not too hot.",
    "Fall and winter are the best year.",
    "Was waiting in winter to snow here in Istanbul, but unfortunately it's not same for me.",
    "It didn't snow where I live in the Netherlands and I think I think that some part of the country got snow, but it wasn't where I am.",
    "And it was just a little bit.",
    "Anyway, it was like a one day thing and it melted pretty quick.",
    "So yeah, it was like not a real winter.",
    "Alright, so I'm giving a little little tiny.",
    "Dots to the.",
    "The top and the bottom of the chair to make it feel a little bit more.",
    "Grounded.",
    "Now in the reference, there's two more chairs.",
    "One is behind here.",
    "Behind the other one and one is a little further down.",
    "This is the type of stuff that I honestly find a little tedious to do, like I.",
    "That's kind of what we get in the actual photo reference to.",
    "So before, after, before, after can lower the Opacity.",
    "If it's doing a little too much, it's kind of intense.",
    "We can also go for like a green.",
    "You want.",
    "Newer photo shop has a color wheel too.",
    "Yeah, that's right, that's right pablos.",
    "So I have um Coulouris extension, but if you have Photoshop CC 2019 or later or you know any more recent ones, you can go to window color and there is a color wheel here.",
    "So if you prefer it might be showing up as the Hue Cube, but if you go to this menu you can change it to color wheel.",
    "This was very nice for people like me that prefer the triangle.",
    "I still use color is because I've already paid for it and.",
    "It does have some extra features, gamut masks and things like that that are nice, but yeah, if you're looking just for the triangle color wheel, Photoshop has that now and it's I prefer it.",
    "I don't know.",
    "It's a personal preference thing.",
    "You know, some people still prefer the cube, but I like the color wheel.",
    "All right, so if we show the before and after this is before after of the vig net and the.",
    "The extra brightness behind the tree so it really changes where your eye focuses for me, I'm a less looking at the water and more looking towards the tree were not finished yet, but it's just interesting how those little changes can affect where your viewer is going to look in the scene, so it's nice to think about.",
    "But I want to go back in now and do some more painting.",
    "So.",
    "Let's look at.",
    "I actually have some brushes that I intended to be for the purpose of painting foliage and stuff like that, which I haven't even really used in this painting, and I'm not sure if it's like too late to bring him out, but I've got some that have.",
    "Some leave kind of leaf effects and things, and maybe at least in the foreground it could be nice to put in some of that.",
    "Some of these individual little.",
    "Shapes looking like leaves.",
    "Not sure if I like it, but let's do a little bit more.",
    "I like to use brushes like this to help with like these silhouettes.",
    "If I want the shape of these little individual leaves the pop out here, it's nice to have.",
    "Not have to paint every individual one.",
    "Fresh looks like this.",
    "We also have some leaves coming down from the top right here and I think I will probably.",
    "Maybe I'll paint these myself, or maybe we'll just block him in and then paint on top.",
    "It kind of works out.",
    "Bring a branch down.",
    "I like this because it makes it feel like you're really in the scene, doesn't it?",
    "Having this little branch come down?",
    "What's the story behind this work?",
    "Is it for a client or project?",
    "It's just a study, there's no.",
    "Nothing too interesting storywise behind it.",
    "Just a photo study.",
    "To show a just showing my process in digital painting.",
    "I do a lot of photos.",
    "Studies actually do this every Wednesday here, and I go through showing.",
    "Showing my process and talking through work workflow.",
    "And anybody is welcome to join in.",
    "I always share my references.",
    "Below that, the stream in the description, you can find the reference image and.",
    "We like to paint together to do some studies.",
    "So I want to add in with the.",
    "With that what I did with the brush here.",
    "I'm going to make selections.",
    "For individual leaves.",
    "Did you do any streams that Adobe live?",
    "No, no, I haven't just on my just here on on be hands.",
    "On my own channel.",
    "OK, so I'm making a selection for some more more leaves.",
    "Of the whole painting.",
    "This is the part that I'm kind of like.",
    "I feel like I have to sort of use my.",
    "Discipline a little bit more to get through this part and get into the areas that I'm more interested in painting, but.",
    "Gotta do it if we want to paint the rest of the scene.",
    "We gotta paint these chairs.",
    "It's a little bit tedious.",
    "But it'll be worth it.",
    "All right, we've got one back here.",
    "I'm trying to keep them roughly in the right.",
    "Um proportions to each other so that it feels like they are the same size and belong at the same table.",
    "Resize this one.",
    "We gotta put little cushions and then we should be good to go.",
    "That's a nice red cushions on the chairs, although we could change different colors and have to be read, but I think the colour works is pretty classic.",
    "Sorry, my neighbors outside making some noise, so I hope it's not too annoying for you guys.",
    "Alright, I'm going to put all the chairs on one layer.",
    "Actually this one I can't 'cause it's in front of the others.",
    "But let's begin with the little cushions.",
    "So the cushions show a lot of they have a big.",
    "3D kind of quality to them because they have a dark shadow on the bottom and then the area that's being hit by light is quite a bit brighter and more pink, so it's really pretty and makes the cushions really have a 3D kind of pop to them.",
    "So I'm starting with the darker color.",
    "And then we will pick something later still, like a red color.",
    "And that's not it.",
    "So it.",
    "Start for 2 hours and just melted ha.",
    "That's kind of what happened here, although it didn't snow in my area, but in the South part of the Netherlands, it seems like it snowed in.",
    "In Belgium.",
    "It snowed for a little bit and then didn't last very long so.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Maybe next year.",
    "I know some of you are living in places where it's noted time that you probably like.",
    "Quit complaining, but I was just hoping to take some reference pictures in the snow for painting, so that's why I was.",
    "I was really hoping for it.",
    "All right, and the chairs also have these little.",
    "Weaved.",
    "Pieces supports in the back that are really pretty and there like this tan color.",
    "I guess I should just probably paint a solid color for that.",
    "Trying to decide how to approach this.",
    "I'm going to undo that.",
    "It snowed in Austin for bits and melted.",
    "Everyone was freaking out so I guess it doesn't.",
    "Usually snow there then.",
    "I bet.",
    "It's always fun for kids.",
    "In that case they may have not seen it.",
    "Very much before.",
    "OK, so I'm going to paint this in a solid color.",
    "The backs of the chairs.",
    "Get the weave pattern in there.",
    "All right?",
    "There's some places where the light is hitting these iron chairs, and we get a different colour reflecting off of them like a.",
    "Bright Green Gray, Green, Blue.",
    "I'd like to have some of them overlapping and I like the idea that summer little darker than others.",
    "The light shining through.",
    "Going to lock the transparency and dark in some of the other leaves so they kind of blend in more.",
    "I think we're getting there.",
    "Thanks Makaveli, nice the branch brings it back to the focal point.",
    "Yeah, the branch.",
    "Kind of Swoopes and inward a little bit.",
    "Although one thing I need to be careful of is I think the.",
    "The branch is a little bit more interesting in the reference because it has this nice little opening.",
    "Space in there, so we'll make sure we leave that in.",
    "Give some breathing room.",
    "Give some negative space.",
    "All thank you.",
    "Thanks Ryan.",
    "I I have to admit that a lot of that came from the color dynamics.",
    "Brushes were experimenting with that and going pretty intense with like letting the color dynamics effect work.",
    "And then I went back in and like did a little bit of my own thing on top.",
    "But I was really amazed how well it worked out with the colour dynamics.",
    "I turned off apply per tip and let it just change each brush stroke slightly was really fun.",
    "I will probably do it again.",
    "So right now we're kind of doing finishing touches and things, adding some last little.",
    "Textures.",
    "Yes, I am achin.",
    "I am from the US English.",
    "My first language.",
    "I'm living in the Netherlands now and I am learning Dutch but not well enough to stream this dream in it.",
    "But yeah, I think I will always dream in English anyway just because it's.",
    "Ability to.",
    "For I think I think for more viewers to understand.",
    "I know for a lot of you guys, English as a second language, so I really appreciate.",
    "Your effort to speak.",
    "Speak in English to me so we can hang out together and I'm as I'm learning a second language now.",
    "I really can appreciate it more.",
    "English is my first language.",
    "I'm going to put some little.",
    "Some more little breaks in the foliage here.",
    "Looking through to the Sky, although I think that brush might be a little bit too much.",
    "Will find something less intense.",
    "The only problem with making I'm making a.",
    "A new brush there right now.",
    "What other things that I find sometimes is I'm doing trial and error.",
    "I have a bunch of brushes that I'm not super familiar with yet, so I'm kind of like sorting through my brushes, trying to find the right one so.",
    "Sorry for that.",
    "Alright, so if anybody was if anybody was painting along, if you'd like to share your painting, you're welcome to post it in the chat.",
    "If you need more time to work on it, then no worries, you're welcome to take your time.",
    "Stream isn't over yet, and you can share it whenever you're ready.",
    "But I might be soon working, moving on to another painting.",
    "And leaving this one as finished.",
    "We could go on and on and on detailing this, but for me it was just meant to be a.",
    "Couple hour photo study and I think, thinking that time that I'm.",
    "Pretty ready to call it done.",
    "I don't know see if we can find the right color.",
    "Something like that.",
    "So the lights heading here.",
    "I want to make sure that it.",
    "Shows up that way.",
    "And we can also choose, you know 'cause.",
    "With artists in the situation, you can choose to add a little extra light somewhere that it doesn't actually exist.",
    "If you really want to draw attention to some area, you can choose to make that your focal point.",
    "All you need to do is.",
    "You know, maybe add a little bit more of a pop of light there.",
    "You like the chairs, thank you.",
    "Well then they were worth the effort.",
    "Thank you, Suzanne, thank you.",
    "Add a little more highlight up at the top.",
    "The chairs have been extra little detail in them, but I think I'm going to keep it simple for now because at this rate the painting is going to go very slow, so I'm going to merge them together.",
    "So now I have this all together as one.",
    "And I think I like overall the position of the chairs and everything.",
    "It's not identical to the reference, it's a little bit.",
    "Bigger.",
    "Can make it a little smaller and closer to the tree.",
    "Look like 3D chairs.",
    "Oh, thank you.",
    "Well, I'm glad that they look.",
    "Believable 3D Wise.",
    "The shadow side of the of the chairs is.",
    "On the right, in this case, away from the wall, where we get a lot of bounce light so I can add a little extra shadow on the.",
    "Chairs facing that side, we want to make them.",
    "A little bit more 3D.",
    "So I want to work on the area behind the chair is a little bit and I think it might be finally time to get into some specific shapes of these leaves on the walls and things like that.",
    "So I'm going to take the same brush that I used to actually paint the leaves on the trees or one of the one of the brushes and use that to paint the leaf pattern on the wall and we'll see how it goes.",
    "It might be a little bit too.",
    "Specific because with this situation, the dappled lighting off, then you'll see a like a blur effect.",
    "It's not going to be like so so so perfectly precise, so we could use a blur filter.",
    "That would be one way to do this, so I'm going to paint them in with this brush, just allowing them to be pretty crisp, and then let's try a blur filter and see if that looks good.",
    "So basically going from the light towards dark and vice versa giving this look of specific little leaves.",
    "On the wall.",
    "Some color picking from the pink going into the.",
    "The white and then back and forth.",
    "I'm trying to make some interesting shapes here.",
    "Takes a little trial and error.",
    "All the way up here.",
    "Glad I didn't merge the trees down yet.",
    "'cause I can now paint behind the tree pretty easily still.",
    "Appear there's tiny, tiny little flecks of light.",
    "I really like it.",
    "It's very pretty.",
    "Maybe I should have made the shadows even darker on the.",
    "The wall, that way these light.",
    "Patches would be even more dramatic.",
    "But there might be something that we can edit.",
    "Um, do I am a full time streamer.",
    "I stream here and also on Twitch.",
    "And.",
    "I also sell my I'm a digital and traditional painter.",
    "I also saw my traditional paintings so basically just.",
    "Working working for myself at the moment.",
    "So if you guys painted along and you want to share, you can just post in the chat.",
    "You don't need any special permissions or anything.",
    "I'm just going to add a few more leaves here.",
    "I keep thinking I'm done and then seeing like one more thing I want to do.",
    "Typical.",
    "Oh that's OK.",
    "Clever, no worries.",
    "I think you also gotta.",
    "I had quite a Head Start before some of you have joined in, so no worries you take take your time.",
    "Thanks Rick.",
    "OK, well I will post this after stream.",
    "Well, maybe not immediately after stream but I will post this study.",
    "And I'll share my.",
    "Actually my Instagram is in the below the stream in the description, but I'll post in chat as well if that's more convenient.",
    "I post a lot of these studies on my Instagram and I also like to post them here on behalf, of course, but I kind of like to save my very best ones for big hands 'cause it's more of a portfolio for me, so we'll see if this one is going to make the cut or not, but I'll definitely post it on my Instagram and maybe I'll post it here too.",
    "But this, I think is finished for now.",
    "Thank you, Brad.",
    "Thank you.",
    "I wanna do one more painting Study together today.",
    "Also those of you who are going to share your work.",
    "Yeah, take your time.",
    "No rush.",
    "I'm going to take a very quick break to get some more water in between these paintings.",
    "So I've been talking a lot, but I'm going to.",
    "Paint next, I think something maybe something nice and green.",
    "Maybe next green waterfall if you guys want to stick around.",
    "If anybody came in during the stream and you're interested in to see a painting from the beginning, will be starting a new one from a blank canvas.",
    "Project I Madeon chat.",
    "This looks amazing.",
    "Hey project, thank you, thank you.",
    "Yeah this is a.",
    "This was really fun.",
    "What do you do?",
    "More paint with dynamic size or dynamic opacity?",
    "Dynamic size?",
    "Well actually both, but I've been leaning more and more towards opaque brushes rather than using a lot of transparency.",
    "But I do use both.",
    "Thank you I see us.",
    "Thanks Leandro, thanks for the nice comments.",
    "I'm going to take a very quick break.",
    "I will put on a slide show of some of my previous artworks so you can see those while I'm gone for like a couple minutes.",
    "Hi Jane, for anyone is coming in I'm sorry to leave you but I'll be back in a 2 minutes and we will begin anew painting so I hope you stick around and I'll see you soon.",
    "Hey guys, thank you very much for waiting for me.",
    "OK, so I've done a bunch of leaves.",
    "She let's raise this up a little bit.",
    "Higher in the reference we see this end.",
    "This Patch of lay end above the chair.",
    "And then there's another.",
    "Come down here.",
    "Something like that.",
    "It looks very messy, but let's see what we can do filter.",
    "I'm going to go to blur and there's a lot of different blurs we can use, lens blur, gausian blur, motion blur can sometimes be good for this kind of thing.",
    "If you put it at a very very low amount of motion.",
    "I'm going to go for a Gaussian blur.",
    "Thing.",
    "Should the arm on the left be there?",
    "Oh no, I need to cover that up.",
    "Good catch.",
    "OK, so this is with a little bit of a blur filter.",
    "I don't know if I really like it.",
    "I think part of the reason is because we're taking.",
    "We're kind of combining.",
    "Uh.",
    "I'm trying to take a traditional approach to painting this, so I guess putting like a photographic lens blur filter it could work, but it's not really taking it in the direction I'm trying to go in.",
    "Where is our chairs?",
    "OK yeah we need to.",
    "Get rid of this OK.",
    "Better.",
    "OK, I'm going to get rid of that.",
    "I'm going to do a lot of trial and error sometimes in a painting, so I'm going to try again with the.",
    "Might be OK once you add more brightness.",
    "Yeah, let's let's take a look at that, so I'm going to make a selection of this area.",
    "And I will add an adjustment layer.",
    "Let's look at the levels.",
    "So now it's only adjusting that wall.",
    "I think I want to just really bump up the contrast there.",
    "I don't know.",
    "Maybe I should do that to the whole the whole image.",
    "It definitely makes it feel brighter.",
    "Definitely feel the light a little bit more intensely.",
    "There's a couple places we might like that brighter light so.",
    "Our result there.",
    "The ground will get a little bit more of that balance late too.",
    "This little bit of a glow.",
    "Yeah, I definitely want to put a glow around it.",
    "I think that'll be really satisfying to do.",
    "So for me I have the tendency to.",
    "To like painting the.",
    "The shape and getting well in this case I think it would be nice to get like a clean shape for what I want with the patches of light.",
    "And then.",
    "Will add some.",
    "Will add a little extra glow.",
    "On top of that I think is going to be my plan.",
    "Want to sit in this painting has some coffee.",
    "It is like giving everyone that feeling me too me too.",
    "I'm ready for cappuccino.",
    "OK, I'm going to paint with the image in black and white for a little bit.",
    "I showed this earlier, but there's a shortcut that you can set up in Photoshop.",
    "You just have to set it up once and it will always be there for you.",
    "It turns it allows you to turn your painting quickly into black and white, and you can actually color pic and paint while you're painting is in.",
    "This black and white.",
    "Version and it's Super Super Handy.",
    "So I think one of the things that I want to do is just real quick, like paint in this.",
    "Black and white to fix some of my.",
    "We're back to do some more painting, but let's see if I missed anything.",
    "Jackson Joker says beautiful worth Mattie.",
    "Here's my take alright, let's see.",
    "See what Jackson painted with us?",
    "Oh wow, this came out awesome.",
    "Check this out, you guys.",
    "Let me get this reference out of the way so we can see.",
    "That is beautiful.",
    "I absolutely love it.",
    "The tree and the mountain back here.",
    "Probably my favorite areas which works well.",
    "River coming back around.",
    "Yeah, it's a very nice composition and beautiful rendering.",
    "Hi Cody, welcome.",
    "This is a beautiful work by Jackson Joker in the chat.",
    "I like the dimension you gave to the foliage is really nice with the lighter green on top.",
    "Feels very 3D.",
    "Oh, I'm glad you painted with us.",
    "This is awesome.",
    "I really like and I like the style on the top left, top left mountain 2.",
    "Glove back on.",
    "And yeah, we're going to start and you painting.",
    "So let me grab a reference image.",
    "This is going to be something a little different.",
    "With intense lighting, so this is going to be.",
    "This is another reference from pixels, actually the other one from today was Unsplash.",
    "This is pixels and I will share the link.",
    "In chat and I will also post it.",
    "Um?",
    "I also post it below in the stream description, so give me one moment.",
    "Sorry for the way guys, I just need to update everything for people that want to paint along so you can find the reference.",
    "So the second image has been added below and.",
    "I'll also.",
    "Add it to the links above, the chat and the info panel.",
    "I'm going to add it there too.",
    "So.",
    "Do that.",
    "You saw this one.",
    "Yeah, when you showed me the waterfall you painted earlier that it reminded me of this kind of similar lighting.",
    "All right, so this is the next one.",
    "We're going to paint.",
    "Uploading my to be hands rushing.",
    "Don't brush clever.",
    "Take your time.",
    "It's totally fine unless you need to go or something, but stream isn't ending so you have time.",
    "There's no need to rush.",
    "OK, so let's do reference to.",
    "We're going to post.",
    "This in the.",
    "Info tab and then we should have everything updated.",
    "OK so if you guys wanted to grab that reference image you should be able to find it and description an info tab were good and I'm going to use pure ref to put a.",
    "Little thumbnail view appear.",
    "Move that over actually.",
    "I will move this one to the other monitor next to chat.",
    "Let's get a new canvas here.",
    "So the reference image size was 1500 by 2250 pixels.",
    "I'm going to make my painting a little bit bigger, just in case.",
    "Just in case.",
    "Values the shading dark to light shading wasn't working.",
    "Perfectly here.",
    "So we're going to paint them black and white for a couple moments and then take a look at it.",
    "Ha ha oh you guys are sweet.",
    "Well enjoy your coffee.",
    "Awesome, good mood.",
    "Definitely get moved.",
    "Hi John Paul.",
    "Welcome.",
    "So I'm going to brighten up a larger area and then we're going to come back with leaf shapes.",
    "And cut into that area little bit.",
    "I'm going to make this center bar a little bit smaller.",
    "My proportions were a little bit off.",
    "OK, let's go back alright, so here's the before and after before after.",
    "Sometimes it really helps to turn it in black and white.",
    "To get a fresh look.",
    "But I do want to do some more work on this wall in general.",
    "Getting there.",
    "Yeah.",
    "It's it's getting a little better.",
    "OK, I'm going to try making a new layer.",
    "We're going to put it on overlay.",
    "And I will choose an airbrush.",
    "And I want to brighten up the.",
    "Even the shadows on the wall there just a little too dark, I think.",
    "So I'm using overlay.",
    "I'm going to choose a brighter maybe.",
    "A warm orange.",
    "And.",
    "Try to lighten up some area around the highlights.",
    "Hey sorry please.",
    "Thanks, I'm glad you liked the reference.",
    "I'm going to put a layer on lightning mode also and try that.",
    "I just feel like.",
    "Overall, I want the sunlight feeling to come through a lot more than it was.",
    "So it may differ from the reference a little bit, but you know what?",
    "This is our painting.",
    "We gotta sometimes make choices like that.",
    "Going to be able to fill a Freedom to make some artistic.",
    "We can be art directors.",
    "In our paintings.",
    "So giving him a little bit more fantasy colors.",
    "And I will merge those down.",
    "So so if anybody is just getting here sour puss, I can go back in time and show you the start of this painting.",
    "I've been saving the layers as we go so we can do a little.",
    "Progress.",
    "Yeah, so that's where we are right now.",
    "So we can do layer and I want to work on the leaf shapes.",
    "Let's get back to that.",
    "But I haven't figured out how.",
    "I might just have to kind of paint them by hand.",
    "Just go in here and do this.",
    "I was looking for a.",
    "Magic.",
    "Brush effect.",
    "And maybe even a softer brush would be nice.",
    "Alright, so just like we're bringing little white leaf shapes into the pink or bringing pinkley shapes into the white, just like you see in the reference, some of them are going to be separate from the group.",
    "So go out about 4000 by 2500 pixels.",
    "Going to save this.",
    "Waterfall study.",
    "I JS.",
    "Alright, so I think we're set.",
    "If anybody has any questions or if you have any trouble finding the reference images, let me know and we'll make sure we fix it.",
    "But I will be talking through my process as we go here, and if you have any questions let me know.",
    "Will try to go step by step.",
    "So I think I will start with a sketch on this one.",
    "I usually I bake.",
    "I use a sketch like 8 out of 10 times.",
    "I use the sketch most of the time, but sometimes I don't.",
    "But I think I will for this one.",
    "It really helps me to plan out what I'm doing, so I'm just going to look at what's going on right here on this reference and try to match that as much as possible.",
    "And if anything.",
    "I'd like to try to simplify some of what's there, so that means you know looking for opportunities to stylize or simplify.",
    "If there's a lot of busy stuff going on, trying to pick out the most important thing and just focus on that.",
    "So, for example this branch.",
    "It's got a lot of little branches and Twigs coming out.",
    "But maybe just getting the main branch and picking a couple of the most important ones, that sort of a way to start I think.",
    "And then we can add more if needed and get into that kind of details.",
    "Yeah, yeah you can.",
    "There's a link in the description to my discord server, so you're welcome to join that if you like, and you can post.",
    "There are channels in there for sharing your art for sharing work in progress, things like that and.",
    "Then if you want to share, if you're painting along with these studies and you want to share, that's a place you can post your image and then take the URL and post it in the chat.",
    "You can't post images directly from your PC into the chat, but you can upload them to somewhere like discord or any social media site, and then put the link in chat and that should work fine.",
    "So we've got a pretty big like Boulder up here and then these Little Rock, so a way of simplifying.",
    "I'm looking at these.",
    "These are actually two rocks, but starting with one line.",
    "To start breaking that up and then we can kind of divide them up within that.",
    "OK, let's see clever joined us for the last one.",
    "Is loading slowly for me for some reason there we go alright.",
    "Check this out guys.",
    "This is from clever.",
    "Beautiful colors.",
    "I'm a big fan of this warm.",
    "Like Would you call this almost almost like burnt Sienna?",
    "Kind of color?",
    "Nice atmospheric perspective.",
    "The lighter mountain in the background.",
    "Very pretty clever.",
    "I know you did this super fast because you started halfway when I was already halfway done so.",
    "Nice work, thank you for joining.",
    "It's it's very nice to have company with these studies.",
    "Oh cool pablos.",
    "I wish I knew how to do that also.",
    "Well good luck with your with your fonts.",
    "Yeah, you're always welcome to join in the future.",
    "So now I'm dividing up this these rocks into.",
    "But two different ones, but starting out just with that one gesture.",
    "And it's nice to be able to move the stuff around.",
    "It's part of the reason I like to keep my sketches on multiple layers at the beginning, like if I have one rock and I have a tree in front.",
    "I'm going to keep the tree on a separate layer 'cause it can easily move these things around.",
    "And then.",
    "Merge them at the end.",
    "Fresco has a time-lapse, cool, awesome so the one that we just looked at on the artwork from clever in the chat was done in Frisco.",
    "You can check out clevers page if you want to see it.",
    "Did you also upload the time lapse to your page?",
    "I love that it automatically that can automatically save a time lapse like that.",
    "It would be awesome if Photoshop has that in the future too.",
    "That would be very happy.",
    "Alright, so I'm kind of trying to pull out the interesting angles that I'm seeing here.",
    "So we're going to get some random little ones in here.",
    "Stuff like that.",
    "Thank you muneer.",
    "Did you use religious for the chair?",
    "They look very good.",
    "Oh thanks.",
    "I'm glad to hear that I didn't use anything special for the chairs.",
    "Just just looking at the reference.",
    "But they were a little bit tedious to do compared to the rest of the painting, which has been pretty fun.",
    "I feel like the chairs were like I had kind of slow down and.",
    "Get into the details there, but glad I'm glad it worked.",
    "The references from Spain.",
    "And I found it on Unsplash.",
    "If you want to see the originals photographer, put the original photographers post.",
    "There's a link below the stream description.",
    "It's such a pretty such a pretty reference.",
    "Thanks thanks Sir Plus.",
    "Yeah, if anybody.",
    "If you guys like the image, you're welcome to use it.",
    "And share your art.",
    "If you paint along, its from Unsplash so it's a free to use image.",
    "Like the color.",
    "Things to.",
    "Yes, now I'm just using a basic round brush for these little highlights.",
    "Collected for leader.",
    "Yeah, good idea.",
    "I've been keeping little little collections on Unsplash and.",
    "Pixabay and pixels to use for painting reference and things like that.",
    "It's nice, especially when.",
    "There's a day where you want to work on something, but you just don't have any ideas.",
    "You can go find something nice and just do a little study.",
    "Olivier, thank you.",
    "So I'm going to do the same thing up here and.",
    "Go back and forth with the leaf shapes.",
    "There's a few places that need to do this.",
    "I like this hot pink color.",
    "It's really intense.",
    "And the Orange.",
    "Maybe it's a little too intense, but I like it.",
    "So I'm sorry that I'm not explaining too much at the moment, I'm kind of doing the same thing over and over here, 'cause I'm just working on going back and forth with these little circles, so there's not too much to say about this.",
    "But if you do happen, have any questions about anything or what I'm doing, you're welcome to ask.",
    "Well, most through this step I think.",
    "Ah.",
    "Good vibes well cheers.",
    "Choose.",
    "Drinking some tea over here.",
    "Always have to have tea while painting or coffee.",
    "Gotta have something nice.",
    "From the relaxing painting session.",
    "Love in your second version of the wall.",
    "Happy and bright thanks.",
    "I think it was I think is an improvement.",
    "Had a lot of.",
    "Yeah, the shadows were a little too dark.",
    "I mean, even though I think this is like brighter than the reference.",
    "For some reason, I feel like it's working better.",
    "Yeah, good spot.",
    "Harry is the Starbucks Florida edition.",
    "Kind of an older mug now.",
    "Alright, we're gonna have a little plant coming in from the side looking at the chairs now compared with the light and everything next to it.",
    "Got this little area, the waterfall pouring out.",
    "Coming down like this.",
    "Not a proper font.",
    "You can't type with.",
    "It basically shapes that are letters only to be used for headlines.",
    "That's cool.",
    "I do I have a Wakeham Centriq 22.",
    "That's the model.",
    "Of my tablet.",
    "Alright, so I'm going to merge these layers so we've got our sketch and I think I gave a little bit of more space.",
    "Yeah, let's go.",
    "Let's give a little bit.",
    "Like that?",
    "Interested to see how you paint the waterfall, thanks.",
    "Well I will try to do something good.",
    "I like the house splashy, it is, there's a lot of water droplets and it's pretty like it's got a nice like little explosion so this is different than a lot of watercolors that waterfalls that I painted before that have been more at a distance.",
    "And you get that big stream.",
    "So I think this is cool.",
    "I'm going to put my layer on, multiply an lower the opacity that will make it easier to see through my sketch as we're painting below and anywhere between 20 and 30%.",
    "Usually opacity, and then I'll lock the layer so I can paint underneath and I don't accidentally paint on this layer because yeah, that happens.",
    "It happens to us also if you lock the layer, it's less likely to paint on it, so.",
    "Let's let's begin, so I'm going to take a little.",
    "Trick I guess from traditional painting and use a an underpainting this color this kind of warm color is very popular to use for under paintings in traditional.",
    "That's what I was talking about with this sort of burnt Sienna color.",
    "So I'm just going to pretend this is like a bill canvas.",
    "Paint the whole background in.",
    "This is nice 'cause it gets rid of the white.",
    "I don't know about you guys, but I hate painting when there's a white on the canvas.",
    "It's hard for me to visualize the lights and darks in the scene, so.",
    "Um?",
    "This will be a good.",
    "Start.",
    "And then we can actually add a little bit of shading if you want to kind of think through the what the values are going to be like in the scene.",
    "It's a lot of rim light at the top and then shadows, so I'm a big fan.",
    "I love this kind of lighting.",
    "Light shining through the greens so we've got something roughly like this going on.",
    "I'm sorry, foster yeah.",
    "I hope your Internet fixed to this is not a time when you want to have Internet problems, but I'm glad you were able to at least paint with us despite it.",
    "This is our background, so we're going to make a new layer an now start painting on top of this.",
    "And.",
    "Let's have some fun with brushes.",
    "I might try some some different textures and things.",
    "I'm going to go with a real bright green appear.",
    "Well, that's that's a little too much.",
    "That's a little brighter like I wanted a bright green, but let's not put that one.",
    "Let's try something like a little bit more natural feeling.",
    "So OK, I'm not going to worry about painting over the branch and all that stuff.",
    "We're going to paint the branch on top.",
    "This is just starting back to front.",
    "So I will turn on color dynamics.",
    "We really liked this last time it was fun, so I'm going to uncheck apply protip so each brush stroke that I make, it's going to slightly alter the color based on the amount of Hue, saturation and brightness jitter that I chose there, so.",
    "Do use a mouse for painting high badanai.",
    "Use a tablet, a screen tablet.",
    "So my model is the Wakeham Centriq 22, so it's I'm using this stylus to draw on the screen.",
    "But there's a lot of different types of tablets out there.",
    "If you're looking for information.",
    "If you type actually, you know what I'm giving you.",
    "Yeah, I'm going in autopilot here.",
    "Let me let me paste the link in the chat for what I wanted to share.",
    "This page.",
    "Uh.",
    "That I just posted in the chat that will have a section about tablets and some links to some different blogs with information and things like that.",
    "I'm wondering if I need to make the shares a little bit brighter.",
    "I'm wondering if I need to make them a little bit brighter.",
    "Because it seems like now they feel really dark compared to the area that they were sitting in, and I don't know if that makes little sense.",
    "They should be probably a little bit brighter.",
    "Or at least like more contrast between the braids in the darks.",
    "Hopefully that reads OK.",
    "All.",
    "On sorry gene pool, but I'm glad you're still watching and and learning something.",
    "That's a great thing about stream, because honestly, I'm better at showing things than.",
    "Then I explaining in a lot of words so.",
    "Let's get at least we can.",
    "We can see what's going on.",
    "Yeah, I find it a lot easier to.",
    "Show what I what I mean with the visuals.",
    "So there's a little sprinkling of light appear in the blue.",
    "Hi Alma's, loving it.",
    "Would you say your styles mix of realistic in watercolor feel?",
    "Thanks I would love to describe it as that in traditional.",
    "I'm a gouache painter that's just my favorite medium at the moment.",
    "And I like watercolor too and gouaches water medium.",
    "You know, it's a little bit different, but I think that's where a lot of the influences coming from.",
    "I'm trying to apply things that I am learning from traditional gouache medium, which I really love and bring some of those textures and effects into digital to give it a more traditional feeling so.",
    "Yeah, I would say so and it's nice to hear if you are getting that impression.",
    "Because I did digital painting before getting into traditional painting, I.",
    "I feel like I it was easier for me to gravitate towards Gouache because you can paint the light colors over top of dark colors and things.",
    "I tried to do some watercolor.",
    "And I found it super super difficult because you have to really plan out everything and you can't.",
    "Once you go to dark in an area, there's not too much you can do about it unless you're going to bring in another type of medium.",
    "So.",
    "I notice that.",
    "I think it has a little bit to do with my digital background that I prefer gouache.",
    "For that ability.",
    "Hi Ahmed Gaitian Welcome everybody.",
    "You guys can find my reference image below in the description.",
    "If you're interested to check it out, there's also a bunch of links there I have.",
    "Things that I get commonly asked.",
    "I tried to just link below so there might be something you're looking for.",
    "Oh my gosh, I'm a huge fan Harry.",
    "I'm a huge fan of James Gurney's work and his YouTube channel is super, super informative.",
    "He has some.",
    "Really good books as well.",
    "That's awesome if you see any similarity at all between us.",
    "It's a big compliment, so thank you.",
    "Halo Sama Welcome everybody, hope you're having a good day.",
    "So right now I'm working on the.",
    "Not shadows, but the bounce light underneath the chairs.",
    "There's some light reflecting off of the wall pretty brightly, so we're going to get the lights in and then we need some darks too because there is not only bright highlights but there's little shadows in little under the chair an with I guess there's little like garbage cans or something I don't know.",
    "I'm not going to paint those in.",
    "Are the chairs and tables going to have worse?",
    "A slight drop shadows yes yes they will.",
    "They need drop shadows right now.",
    "They're not quite.",
    "It's not quite selling me that, they're like, really.",
    "Sitting there in the scene.",
    "I mean, they're there, but they're not.",
    "We need more evidence.",
    "We need more shadows, I think yeah.",
    "On the same page.",
    "Alright, let's try it and see what we can do a little bit more.",
    "I'm going to flip for some reason.",
    "I feel like it's going to be easier for me to do it from this angle, so flip the reference to.",
    "If you're looking to get into it and you need some guidance on what kind of tablet to get, there's a lot of information there.",
    "You don't have to jump in and get the same type of tablet I have.",
    "It's a little bit more of a high end one, but there's a lot of good tablets out there that are in all different price ranges so.",
    "You can check that out if you're interested.",
    "All right, so we've got a background starting very abstract at the moment, but it's really fun to paint this way.",
    "It's very like for me, it's very relaxing.",
    "Van live logs highbar welcome.",
    "Book login.",
    "Let's go to a darker color.",
    "I'm looking at this color here.",
    "It looks almost black, but we're going to go a little bit more like Purples and Browns and Blues.",
    "I try to stay away from using pure black in my painting and find other colors that might be suitable and give a stronger mood sense of mood.",
    "So we can start with.",
    "That and then this rock has a lot of Grays and.",
    "Purples and greens.",
    "Oh, thank you.",
    "You are a all that makes me really happy I am.",
    "I'm very excited to finally share it.",
    "Trying to speed that process along, but my guess is it's probably going to be another.",
    "It might be another few weeks just being totally realistic, but I I hope that.",
    "Like around a month from now, it will be.",
    "It will be out.",
    "That's that's my goal.",
    "So I'm going to try to make that happen.",
    "But there's there's certain there's a couple of effects yet that I haven't created a good brush for, and I want it to be like well rounded, so I'm still working on that.",
    "But thank you for saying that.",
    "Right, so blocking in this over on the left.",
    "If you are struggling at all, picking your colors is OK to color pic from the reference and see what the real color is.",
    "Sometimes that can help provide some clarity.",
    "Um?",
    "So if I color pick, this is the actual color of what's going on over there.",
    "Thanks, Sarah, thank you.",
    "But we don't have to paint everything exactly like the reference.",
    "Of course we can put a little bit of our own taste into it.",
    "So I tend to like to start with the mid tones and then move on to shadows and highlights.",
    "So this scene there's not a ton of Midtones.",
    "Comparatively speaking, there's everything is like pretty dark, and then there's pretty bright areas.",
    "It's like very high contrast, so it didn't take long to move on to the step of adding these darker areas.",
    "There's a really cool glow kind of affect coming up from the water down here.",
    "So right now I'm sticking with one brush in the last painting I kind of did the same thing like it went through the early stages of blocking and everything, just with one brush.",
    "It's kind of nice to move fast and go through the painting and not worry about changing brushes a million times.",
    "And anyway, we're painting pretty large right now.",
    "When we get into little specific textures, we might look at nuances of.",
    "Brushes more, but right now we're just kind of walking in.",
    "So I'm going to put a little bit of.",
    "Color on some of these areas that are going to have a.",
    "A bright Papa flight come in soon.",
    "I'm still going to give them some color now and try to cover up that underpainting and we're going to lighten him up from here.",
    "But dark to light is what we're doing.",
    "I'm gonna try to let myself just kind of sketch these in.",
    "Maybe I'll switch back to a more textured brush and although we got through the leaf painting that I was kind of struggling with.",
    "I have a brush that has like a canvas texture to it and it's kind of fun.",
    "I'm not sure if it's like 2 too much for this, but.",
    "The scene is so colorful, even the shadows here in the reference, the shadows have a really bright blue to them.",
    "Of course I might be.",
    "Exaggerating it a little bit, but.",
    "Also over here on the ground there's a little bit more like teal.",
    "Blue bounce light.",
    "For those of you painting along as I think there's maybe at least one of you.",
    "I hope you're having a good time and enjoying your painting.",
    "I'm curious where you're thinking of this one.",
    "Yeah, there's a lot of sort of crisscross overlapping going on the ground here.",
    "I'm fighting against my urge to kind of make this more clean 'cause I don't want it to be overly clean.",
    "I wanted to feel more like a painting and yet I still sometimes struggle to.",
    "Allow things to be messy.",
    "OK, I think.",
    "I think we can move away from the table and chairs for a little bit.",
    "And work on.",
    "Some other areas of the painting.",
    "I also think I'm going to merge the trees and everything.",
    "Hopefully that's not going to be a big mistake.",
    "So now we have these steps so far.",
    "So first.",
    "Here.",
    "2.",
    "Some what's how it went down, so we'll go from here.",
    "On a new layer one thing, but I haven't included yet or all the gates on the doors and everything.",
    "So I can try to add those will see how it looks on a new layer.",
    "So just a little.",
    "A little detail, but I think.",
    "It gives.",
    "Some personality and you know it tells little about this place and.",
    "Can I identifiable marker for different locations?",
    "These kind of artistic?",
    "Little accents.",
    "Thanks.",
    "The architectural things.",
    "There's going to be plants in front of these.",
    "I think these might actually be windows rather than doors.",
    "The ones I'm painting right now.",
    "So they're going to be more plants on the ground in front covering, covering there a little bit.",
    "Muneer says is it difficult to learn digital painting techniques like it appears in this Christmas winter elf posts?",
    "So Meunier brought up one of my paintings.",
    "This style is, I think popularly known as semi realistic style.",
    "So if you're looking to find tutorials and things related to it, just look up semi realism.",
    "There's there's one artist in particular that I learned a lot from her name is she goes by online sticky Meechan, so you may have heard of her.",
    "She does a lot of pinups, character pinup, art and things, so I'm going to put the name in the chat.",
    "So you can see how it's spelled.",
    "If it helps, while you guys are doing studies, photo studies and things, I really recommend checking your values as you go, like turning your painting into black-and-white.",
    "This is something that I try to do as I go.",
    "I didn't do it that much on the last painting.",
    "I probably should have done it more, but you can do the same with your reference and with the painting and that really help you see where things are going well and where they can improve.",
    "So if you feel like you can't figure something out with your study.",
    "Change it into black and white and I can show you a shortcut for that.",
    "You do have to set it up so this isn't a default shortcut in Photoshop, but it's super handy, so it's like worth setting it up if you go to view.",
    "Proof set up custom.",
    "Click that and then under the proof conditions under the device to simulate, you just want to select working Gray gained 20% from the drop from the huge drop down.",
    "Yeah, so you select working Gray dot gain 20% and press OK and then anytime that you press CTRL Y it's going to turn into your painting into black-and-white.",
    "Once you've done that one time, so then you should be good to go.",
    "And the great thing about this is you can actually color pic and paint while you're in this mode.",
    "So while you're looking at values only, you can still you can still paint.",
    "And you can still color pic from the real.",
    "The real colors in your painting and paint this way, and it's super handy.",
    "So.",
    "If you get stuck, there have been times where this is saved.",
    "A painting for me like things really weren't working.",
    "I couldn't figure it out and I turned into black and white and I just painted like this for awhile, just not even considering color.",
    "Just trying to make the values work.",
    "And then turn it back.",
    "And suddenly I was in a lot better situation.",
    "Oh, thank you, Johnny, thank you for saying that and for hanging out with us.",
    "I appreciate the company.",
    "Hope you're all doing well.",
    "Alright, I think I will be brave and merge this stuff down now.",
    "You don't have to merge now, but I like to do.",
    "It makes me feel like OK, we're moving on to the next step.",
    "It's like more definitive so I'm going to merge and then just make a new layer and keep going.",
    "So let's work on down here.",
    "The water needs a little more love.",
    "So it's a little darker, of course around the outside outside here and then in towards where the waterfall is crashing down.",
    "There's just nice flash of light.",
    "It works out beautifully.",
    "It's really, really nice photo.",
    "Nor for proof of the news that stream that during my University project.",
    "Whoops, I'm sorry.",
    "I'm sorry to be about influence.",
    "But thanks for hanging out with this.",
    "OK I am like ansi to start putting highlights in here.",
    "I don't know about you guys.",
    "I'm I like to go in like an orderly fashion with my workflow, so I'm.",
    "Trying to hold off a little bit more, build our way up to those highlights, but I'm like ready.",
    "OK, let's just let's just do it.",
    "So a new layer.",
    "And I might actually finally switched to a different brush.",
    "Again, I'm testing out these brushes so bear with me if I have to trial and error a little bit which one I want to use the situation?",
    "This one will be good.",
    "But I want to pick a nice bright color for the rock up.",
    "Here we're going to get.",
    "Um, some bright bright light shining right on it.",
    "So I brush that has a little bit textures cool because that'll help give the look of texture on the rock.",
    "When you're painting.",
    "And you want to kind of minimize the amount of work, but get a big affect.",
    "You can, instead of texturing everywhere, you can focus your areas of texture in areas of high contrast in your work.",
    "So anytime that you've got this really intense.",
    "Follow my sketch.",
    "You've got these really intense areas of highlight.",
    "And shadow next to each other that's creating intense contrast.",
    "So let's just look at the reference really quick as I'll show you what I mean over here.",
    "This rock all has texture, of course.",
    "It's all textured down here, but it's really dark and there's not a lot of contrast.",
    "She has a Patris on where she does tutorial videos and things an I subscribe to her Patreon for.",
    "Like over a year earlier in my digital art journey and it was a really really big help to me.",
    "In understanding how to do those particular, she has a lot of really good.",
    "Ways to do that kind of illustration?",
    "She works really quick.",
    "She got a lot of efficient workflow that she does with those so.",
    "You do have to.",
    "It is like a subscription with Patris on so I think she might have a couple free videos on YouTube but it was really really worth the money for me even if you only subscribe for like one or two months you get a lot of videos each term.",
    "So it's I thought it was like very good.",
    "Content for the price.",
    "So I would look for Sikimi Chan.",
    "That's who I learned from on how to paint like that or just semi realist semi realism.",
    "There's a lot of tutorials out there from different artists so I'm sure you'll be able to find something.",
    "And he said, is it difficult?",
    "To learn.",
    "It did.",
    "It did take me awhile.",
    "I did I did do a lot of paintings to get better with that, but.",
    "I hadn't done really done something like it before, so it was.",
    "I had to put in the time, it wasn't.",
    "It wasn't super easy, but it you definitely.",
    "Once you get through the early stages it does get easier.",
    "It's like a little bit of gotta push through the tough beginning and then it's like OK, I'm starting to get it.",
    "You know what I mean?",
    "It's it's worth the effort, but it wasn't super easy for me.",
    "I definitely had to put in time to learn.",
    "But her techniques make it a lot easier rather than trying to figure it all out yourself.",
    "When you said Christmas elf, I was thinking of something completely different really.",
    "Yeah yeah it's not.",
    "Not not a silly Christmas love, but like a winter winter forest.",
    "Oh yeah, she was.",
    "She's more of like A.",
    "Fantasy.",
    "Fantasy character than like a holiday one, but I painted it around Christmas time.",
    "Yeah, you're welcome.",
    "I hope I hope it helps.",
    "If you end up checking him out.",
    "I really like these little swirly details supports on the building here.",
    "Take a look at what time it is.",
    "Who time is going fast?",
    "OK.",
    "Well, we're doing doing pretty well.",
    "I'm going to try to.",
    "Start pulling things together with this.",
    "So we can work towards like the polishing and.",
    "Finishing phase.",
    "I don't know what is up here.",
    "If there's like a some fines or something, but there's like some red Flowers up here.",
    "I think they're attached onto another balcony that I didn't include in my painting.",
    "So I'm going to try something else.",
    "Instead of doing the balcony, I'm going to put a little swirly swirly vines up here, 'cause I like the idea of there being red Flowers back there.",
    "Thanks season.",
    "K project Oh my God yes, project joined the coffee club.",
    "Come join us.",
    "We're going to be sipping sipping cappuccinos outside here.",
    "Talking about painting.",
    "You're like the fourth person or fifth person who said that, including I was also thinking the same thing.",
    "We're on the same page.",
    "We're ready for a trip.",
    "Alright, let's pop in some little red Flowers.",
    "For those of you painting along, if there is anyone I know it's nice to know roughly when I'm going to be ending so that you can.",
    "Share your art along at the end.",
    "So I want to be able to give you an estimate, but I'm not sure I'm.",
    "I'm thinking maybe 30 to 40 minutes if things go well for me to finish this up, but I'm not.",
    "You know, sometimes I can be really wrong and estimates depending on if things go smoothly or not.",
    "Love this kind of painting.",
    "It's kind of hard to see the texture, but the texture is really obvious right here, like you can really get the feeling for the what that rock would feel like if you touched it, and that's because of the way the light is hitting and all these little grooves are getting illuminated in the shadows, and so, yeah.",
    "Of the textures, like very, very obvious.",
    "So you can like for example in this scene we can put a lot of details in that area and it's going to be nice and interesting.",
    "And then the rest of the scene with the areas of the rock.",
    "We don't have to like go quite as detailed as this, and your brain kind of fills in the textures elsewhere, which is super nice.",
    "Thanks, Norbert, thank you.",
    "So it's nice for a quick study, but also depending on your style, 'cause some people are more into more realistic styles and then Kate.",
    "In that case they might go.",
    "Forward with more texturing anyway, but if you're trying to kind of capture something a little bit more simply, then.",
    "But there's something to note.",
    "So you get a little bit more of the this Moss on the rock over here.",
    "Coming down.",
    "Across this area.",
    "And I think over here on the left we also have some.",
    "And it's very much in shadow back here and maybe even go a little bit more towards blue.",
    "Desaturate.",
    "It's not in the light, so we're not going to get those really really bright saturated greens.",
    "Are using a pad to paint.",
    "I am using a screen tablet so it's not one of the pads that's like where your mouse pad would be and then looking up at the monitor.",
    "It's like I'm drawing actually right on the screen.",
    "That's the style tablet that I have.",
    "It's the model.",
    "I'll type it in the chat.",
    "It's the rock com centriq 22.",
    "The one that I have.",
    "OK.",
    "But for anybody looking to get into this, I just want to keep stressing this 'cause.",
    "There's a lot of different styles of tablet out there, and there's a lot of.",
    "A lot of different different price range tablets so.",
    "Don't be alarmed if you look up the Sintec 22 because it's a little bit of.",
    "It's a little bit more pricey, although realistically I Salat.",
    "It's a lot they've come down in price from what they used to be so.",
    "I'm happy with my tablet and the quality of it and everything not necessarily complaining.",
    "But I'm just saying I don't want anyone to look up that tablet and think that's that's what you need to spend to get into Digital Art.",
    "'cause That's not true.",
    "Both answers which photos did did you use for drawing when you are a beginner?",
    "I mean the images with minimal amount of shadows, textures etc.",
    "That's a good question.",
    "Well, let me post some information in the chat for you really quick I think.",
    "So I think you'll have to kind of use your own decision-making on what is going to be difficult or easy for you, 'cause for each person some subjects might be easier, another you know what I mean, something that might be difficult for me might be easier for you depending on what you like and what your experiences, but you can browse for images.",
    "Also give you some websites.",
    "Bees websites here.",
    "Thank you, Kenny.",
    "Pexels, Unsplash, Pixabay and Workfile.",
    "They all have free to use images, so you're like safe to make studies of those and post them.",
    "You can even make prints of your work from them, and it's free to use images so that I always kind of recommend those, and you can browse through and just try to find something simple without too much crazy detail, you know, and you'll know, I think when you're looking at something, if it if you feel like it's a little too overwhelming, and then maybe look for something more simple, I can show you another website that I also use a ton and I know.",
    "Not the only one.",
    "I love using map crunch to find things to paint.",
    "I mean making creatures or Dragons making something mystery.",
    "Ah yes, like mystery fantasy type stuff.",
    "I like that too.",
    "I definitely like it as something to look at, like as a viewer.",
    "I also like looking at that type of Art.",
    "As a creator.",
    "I like it also, but generally more humanoid characters like, not necessarily Dragons and stuff.",
    "It's not that I don't like it, I just don't.",
    "I tend towards human human characters.",
    "My starting up another crystal study for Friday.",
    "Nice, I thought about doing another one today and I was like.",
    "I've done a few of them already, was like I kind of feel like doing something different.",
    "So here we are.",
    "Mix ended up a little bit.",
    "Little details on the pipes.",
    "There's also some wires running through here.",
    "Well, the colour should be a little bit more like blue green color.",
    "So these tiny little wires I love things like this because it seems like when you're painting them, it's like, seems silly to paint like little wires and stuff like, hey, that's not very aesthetic, but doesn't give an overall kind of cozy feeling to the scene when you include those details.",
    "I think it's nice.",
    "Maybe we can be a little choosy like I'm not going to paint in a little trash can.",
    "But I like the wires.",
    "The wires I'll do.",
    "Better paper now learned from my last crystals.",
    "I think doing one more in watercolor would be good kind of put into practice.",
    "That's a good idea.",
    "That's a good idea.",
    "What paper did you get?",
    "Are you saying cold pressed or hot pressed?",
    "I'm curious, I can't remember if you.",
    "If we discussed this already.",
    "If you like the texture paper.",
    "Haha why yourself ugly face once you have them and they work.",
    "Yeah, it's definitely a little at first like.",
    "Going to have a bunch of 'em in there.",
    "I think that it starts to make more sense.",
    "Also, that's of course of personal preference thing too.",
    "Maybe not everybody agrees.",
    "Cold pressed save hot pressed.",
    "It freaks me out too smooth.",
    "I like hot pressed but I'm kinda with you like I don't know I like.",
    "Something in between, almost like for me.",
    "It's perfect if it has a very very light texture.",
    "I don't like deep deep grooves in the paper.",
    "But a light texture is nice.",
    "It's great when you find the perfect paper.",
    "Steven, thank you.",
    "Thanks a lot.",
    "If you guys have any questions, let me know.",
    "Was using 25% cotton, which is fine for gouache but really stops me from doing washes in Gouache now.",
    "Small sheets of 100% or did some bigger without but have to be next week.",
    "Yeah, that will be.",
    "That will definitely help.",
    "I notice the difference myself.",
    "Two with those papers.",
    "If you don't have a big enough proper paper in the cotton paper, sometimes yeah, if you're going to be painting really, really with a lot of water, it just.",
    "It's so unpleasant.",
    "Hot press is great for airbrushing that makes sense.",
    "That makes sense.",
    "I normally used Haha.",
    "I normally use hot press paper despite my.",
    "Complaints it's my usual go too, but sometimes I like the type of paper companies that make hot press that have the tiniest bit of like a smooth texture.",
    "But you can just see the paper texture tiny tiny bit.",
    "Versus like the Super super smooth one Jackson.",
    "Yes I can see your message.",
    "Almost since I started using Photoshop, it really has done wonders what type type of studies do you suggest I do since I just started using photo shop.",
    "You have to do it a little bit more of like a treasure hunt on here.",
    "So basically this website.",
    "Takes images from Google Street View Car and it will give you a random view whenever you click go and so it'll be anywhere in the world and look.",
    "I mean I think this is really pretty.",
    "Just the beautiful clouds and light Rays and tree shapes and everything.",
    "I mean, it's just the side of the road, but you find all these really pretty areas and they're nice to practice.",
    "And it's literally endless 'cause it's like.",
    "How many places in the world the Google Street View car has been and it's quite a lot.",
    "So you can just click go and you get random place.",
    "So if you want to find a specific type of environment to paint, you can click the options here and select a certain country like if you're looking for something tropical or snowy or whatever, you can find a place like this.",
    "You can also click map and then you can drag and drop.",
    "Like this and you'll end up.",
    "You know, getting different places based on where you drop a little little person so you can find places this way, and sometimes they're more complicated than others, so again, you just gotta be careful.",
    "I'll post the link to this in the chat too.",
    "And if you guys are looking for this kind of thing, it's called Virtual Plein air painting, and there's a lot of artists doing this.",
    "Like I said, I didn't invent that.",
    "I love doing it, but I'll put.",
    "I'll type in the chat.",
    "It's called Virtual Plein Air Painting.",
    "This whole idea of the Google Street View images and studying those.",
    "Thanks Sarah.",
    "Yeah, if you look on social media for like virtual pleinair tag hashtag, go find so many good artists like I love following that hashtag because it's really fun to see what people post under it.",
    "And.",
    "Yeah, so that's a recommendation in my discord server we have a channel for Virtual Plein air, so.",
    "There's a lot of people posting good images that they find in the in that.",
    "Channel, so I'm going to post a link to my discord server in the chat.",
    "There's also one below in the stream description, so if you are looking for some Anuar having bad luck because sometimes you get a bunch of good scenes when you use map crunch and other times you get like the boring side of the road and it you know there's nothing there.",
    "So it depends like there's some days that are hit or miss on if you're going to find anything good, but my communities been like posting in the discord whenever we find a good spot.",
    "So if you want to just browse through those rather than searching for hours on map crunch, you can.",
    "Find a bunch of that way too, so you can just scroll up through the channel in discord to find them.",
    "But I love to paint from those.",
    "A lot of what I've done here on behalf has been virtual plane errors painting not all the streams today we're doing or painting right from photos, but I often use the Google Street View Photos.",
    "I just didn't find anything this morning I was planning what to paint today and I'm I wasn't feeling it.",
    "So I picked some photos that I really liked.",
    "Alright, so I want some more variety in the greens up here sort of background so it looks like the yellow green is concentrated a little bit more up here at the top.",
    "So again, I'm painting pretty abstract for the moment.",
    "Things are going to get a little bit more crisp when some of these darker leaves come and hang down in front of this background, then will start making them a little bit more precise leaf shapes, but right now we're just getting a backdrop.",
    "And we can go a little bit more gradient.",
    "Down into.",
    "Like a blue green.",
    "So I want to show you something if you have the situation where you're painting mostly on one layer, like for example I don't have these rocks on a separate layer from the background it's altogether, but if you want to paint within the just the background, one thing you can do is just take a lasso tool like this and trace over the area that you want to paint within.",
    "And then it's very simple to then take your brush and kind of go like this and you don't have to worry about painting in the lines.",
    "I don't have to worry about accidentally going and painting over top of the rock cycle.",
    "Paint nice and free like this, almost as if it was on.",
    "Did you know separate layer so that's part of the reason that I feel comfortable merging so often is like there's lots of different ways with the tools that you can still work around things even with having the merged.",
    "Hello is love a picture?",
    "Reminds me of a place that was near my home when I was growing up.",
    "We would go swimming there all that sounds beautiful.",
    "I'm glad you like it.",
    "Thank you.",
    "It's good to see you usually paint with one brush or swap around.",
    "Oh, I have suggestions.",
    "Well, first of all, almost what kind of art do you want to be able to do?",
    "Ideally like what do you want to?",
    "Are you interested in portraits, landscapes, anything?",
    "Just open minded.",
    "Let me know if you have a particular thing in mind.",
    "Thank you, thank you, carry him if you.",
    "If you guys are interested below my stream in the description, there's a link there.",
    "It says resources and tutorials page and there's a link that has been a list that I've been compiling over the past years that I've been doing digital art.",
    "Just things that have helped me out overtime so it's all like the most helpful tutorials that I found and lots of good stuff there, at least to my tastes.",
    "All things that I found super helpful, so I hope you'll find something.",
    "In there you know there's YouTube channels, there's stuff on Gumroad and Patrion and all different types of things.",
    "One of the things that was really transformative in my art, like I don't know how else to explain it like something that really really changed everything for me was.",
    "Doing shorter time studies and doing virtual plein air painting.",
    "So I was interested in doing environments and just working overall on my understanding of color, an light, different, different lighting scenarios and things like that.",
    "If you're really not interested in landscapes and you want to do portraits, for example, I think you can apply this kind of idea to anything.",
    "But the idea is doing along with whatever other projects.",
    "Let's say you have, you're also doing some personal work and that you.",
    "Want to spend more time on and you know, get a nice Polish result to your painting.",
    "That's totally fine too.",
    "Obviously continue doing that, but along with those types of works, if you find sometimes sneak in some time to do studies for yourself that are shorter and anything between like for me, I would say 45 minutes to a couple hours and just focus on.",
    "The very basics for each thing like the most important things you want to work on our composition.",
    "And values like the lights and darks in the scene and colors but don't worry too much about detail.",
    "Don't worry too much about textures and things like that, just focus on the basic things at the beginning and so you're going to learn.",
    "The thing is when you're painting a landscape so much of the important part of the painting happens at the very beginning.",
    "It happens in the first hour and 2 hours and then after that you're doing a lot of little.",
    "Polishing your polishing, making things look nice.",
    "And this not, but if you really want to get the most bang for your Buck out of the time that you're spending studying, do shorter studies where you just practice that initial stage of the painting process where you're most likely going to fall into errors and problems, and then do that and then move on to the next one.",
    "So stop after the couple hours, try to get as much done as you can that time, and then start the next one and just do those as your studies is not to say you shouldn't spend more time on your work in other.",
    "Situations, but this is a specific type of study that you want to do along with your other work.",
    "All Mrs.",
    "I fell in love with a sceneries.",
    "After seeing your work and also staying in Germany.",
    "There's a lot of beautiful sceneries that I want to paint.",
    "I do want to try doing semi realistic paintings of figures similar to yours so I can add them to the environments.",
    "That's really cool to hear.",
    "I feel like we have a lot of the same goals or you kind of have a similar experience to meet with some of your inspirations.",
    "So let me give you a couple links in particular.",
    "So there's a video.",
    "By you guys, maybe no proco already.",
    "He has a YouTube channel that's super super awesome for artists.",
    "Lots of really good.",
    "Really good information, but he has a video I'm going to share in the chat right now that I would suggest watching to anyone and it's about.",
    "Doing these quick plein air or virtual Plein Air Studies that are shorter and the reason why to do them, he explains it better and in more detail than what I'm saying now.",
    "So if you're a little confused about what I'm saying, watch this video.",
    "It's like 8 minutes.",
    "It's well done and it's going to explain how to make.",
    "Yeah, maximize the efficiency of your practice sessions.",
    "That's what he's talking about.",
    "And So what I do is a lot of studies that are called Virtual Plein Air Studies.",
    "I did not invent this.",
    "OK, there's a lot of artists doing this, so the idea is you use a website, for example, map crunch.",
    "Com is a really popular one.",
    "To find images from anywhere in the world.",
    "I'm going to post that link in the chat too.",
    "So you can just press go and it's going to take you to a random place, so these images are mostly from the Google Street View car, so you're going to see a lot of the side of the road, but there's also you'll find really cute places like look.",
    "I usually swap around quite a bit but not at the very beginning.",
    "That's a good question.",
    "I usually start off with one brush for awhile when I'm blocking in like the basic shapes and then when I get into more details and different textures then I will use different brushes but usually at the beginning one brush for awhile.",
    "It always feels faster when you're just using one brush, but eventually I will start switching switching around.",
    "Probably soon.",
    "So I want to work on this transition between the purple black dark shadows on the Rock and transitioning up into the Midtones and highlights.",
    "I haven't really sorted that one out yet.",
    "I feel like there's some kind of color that I'm missing here.",
    "Thank you, Sarah.",
    "Thank you.",
    "I really appreciate it.",
    "OK, I think I will start with the tree up top now so will make a new layer for that because it is going to be right on top of everything else and I want my little feeling of security that it's.",
    "Not painted right on the layer we will merge it down once I feel like I like what I've done but will try it out like this first.",
    "Separate layer.",
    "So it reshaped going across the top.",
    "The nice thing about keeping this on a separate layer is you can use things like the luck.",
    "Transparency Hi Eric, I'm doing good thanks.",
    "How are you?",
    "I'm enjoying the painting today.",
    "I can give a quick peek for you and anyone who is just coming in now.",
    "We did one other painting before starting this one and this was the previous one.",
    "So if if later anybody wants to go back and watch the video to see this, this was the first one that we did.",
    "Now we're doing a watercolor scene.",
    "Kind of my favorite thing to paint.",
    "Especially with all these grass isn't.",
    "OK, so we have this tree on its own layer.",
    "I'm going to press the lock transparency tool up here.",
    "So that means that anything that I paint is only going to allow me to paint with a metry layer.",
    "Um?",
    "Like this watch appearance, how can I get it?",
    "Oh, are you talking about the cooler is here so if you look asthma if you look below my description the stream description there's a link to Coulouris and there's also a discount code and that's how you would get the color wheel coulouris color wheel if you do have Photoshop CC 2019 or later, you can go to window color and you will have a similar color wheel.",
    "It doesn't have all of the features of colors, but it is.",
    "So triangle color wheel format, so if that's what you're looking for, Photoshop CC 2019 and later already has this.",
    "So you can just just go from the Hue Cuban search bound to color wheel and you'll find it.",
    "Yeah, I like the color wheel to the triangle one.",
    "Hey ODI, I hope you're doing well.",
    "Thank you very much, Eric, I appreciate that.",
    "So I want to get this nice green look at look at that green light on the branch.",
    "It's like there's so much light shining through all of these leaves that it's creating this green glow.",
    "So again, because my layer is locked, I can just paint within that shape of the.",
    "The The Tree and it's like I don't even have to worry about painting in the lines.",
    "It's super easy.",
    "To paint it within the shape.",
    "So love it, love to use that with stuff like this.",
    "And maybe we could throw a little bit of a bounce light on the bottom.",
    "I don't see it strongly in the reference, but it just feels like it should be there.",
    "To me I'm going to put a little bit of light.",
    "I feel like there's a lot of light bouncing off of this area and to me it just feels like it might be nice for the tree to have a little bit of that light up here.",
    "Oh yeah, no problem asthma.",
    "Yeah, so we're going to go with that and then I will check the lock transparency.",
    "So that way I can now paint outside of the lines of that tree and let's.",
    "Let's add some branches so we have him.",
    "In this sketch there's some branches coming down here.",
    "There's very paintable places that you find on here.",
    "Just clicking go.",
    "Going to all different kinds of moods, all different kinds of times of the year, times of day, such a variety and it's super super useful to find a composition that you like from here and paint that and do it in like the shorter amount of time and just work on doing these overtime.",
    "You're going to get better at so many things are going to get better at lighting.",
    "You're going to get better picking compositions from these.",
    "You're going to get better at.",
    "You're going to get faster, so it's like the most transformative thing that I started doing for my art.",
    "Was this particular type of study.",
    "Before doing this, I was.",
    "Yeah, which is a lot slower and I had a lot less.",
    "This was a way for me to get like a lot of knowledge and experience in a relatively short amount of time 'cause I was spending many, many many hours on each painting so it was kind of like taking me longer to gain the experience.",
    "So this is a really helpful way of studying, especially if you're interested in doing environments.",
    "Just doing quick studies from these.",
    "If you look at my Instagram, which I'll post in the chat again in a moment, you can scroll through and see a lot of.",
    "My.",
    "Virtual Plein Air paintings.",
    "From the past, I don't post all of them, but I posted a lot of them and.",
    "Yeah, there's just.",
    "There's so many.",
    "I've been doing.",
    "These are probably done hundreds of them, and that might seem overwhelming.",
    "But don't think about any number.",
    "Just think about doing like.",
    "Whenever whatever works for you, maybe you want to try to do 1 every other day, or like it depends on your individual.",
    "If you're working.",
    "If you're in school, how many?",
    "What went your study regiment is going to be?",
    "If you want to try to be on a schedule at all, but I think it's a really good goal to try to have some kind of schedule and just stick with it.",
    "Overtime, it's going to turn into something that you have a bunch of knowledge that you didn't have before.",
    "If you just stick with it.",
    "I promise.",
    "Um owner says, is it difficult for someone who works in graphic design and coding websites to learn digital painting?",
    "I don't think that it's difficult for someone in graphic design or like that's not what would make it difficult.",
    "It's not like that's working against you or anything linear.",
    "It's just.",
    "For any one, it's going to be work to learn this kind of thing.",
    "For some people, some people maybe have a little bit more of a natural vision in some way or another, like some people tend to be better with Stylizing.",
    "Some people tend to have.",
    "Maybe they work well with colors, like sometimes people have little bit of a natural strength towards a certain area, but beyond that everyone has to go through the same pains.",
    "Learning something new regardless of what you've done before if.",
    "If you already use photo shop and you already have some knowledge of general.",
    "Design rules for your graphic design that could help you, rather than someone who has no artistic knowledge and no knowledge of photo shop, you're in a better place in that person, for example.",
    "Really, oh, that's so cool almost.",
    "Yeah yeah, let me take a look.",
    "That was very nice of him.",
    "Oh these are awesome.",
    "3D.",
    "Yeah, a lot of these are places I would love to paint.",
    "For example something like this.",
    "This is absolutely a scene I would like to paint.",
    "Like the beautiful lighting, warm and cool, the Blues and warm golds.",
    "That's awesome.",
    "Alright, I might be falling behind a little bit in the in the chat.",
    "You guys let me see.",
    "OK, I think I caught up.",
    "If I missed any questions you guys can you guys can repost it.",
    "If anything scrolled up if I didn't see any question you wanted answered, make sure you post it again and I'll.",
    "I'll be sure to answer it.",
    "I'm going to try to do the finishing touches on this painting here.",
    "There's still a couple of flower pots missing, so that's very important.",
    "We can't be missing flower pots.",
    "He's this photo shop in 3D Max.",
    "A lot.",
    "You have three having 3D in your toolkit is really awesome for digital painting.",
    "Yeah, maybe you guys could do some collaborations in the future that be really fun like you can paint over 3D.",
    "A lot of artists and concept artists use 3D's.",
    "There you know there.",
    "Underpainting not really underpainting, but they paint on top of it.",
    "As a base to make the.",
    "Seem more realistic and solid and everything.",
    "And this one comes all the way down and we can think about like we don't have to paint everything exactly like it is in the reference.",
    "If we find that something else might be better for the composition, we can go with that.",
    "Like maybe it would look better to have a little broken.",
    "To have a little broken piece here.",
    "Aiming down and still within this negative space.",
    "We can have some others.",
    "Coming off too.",
    "Some other branches.",
    "You can experiment with this.",
    "It's a separate layer from the background, so we have a bit of freedom.",
    "And there's also branches coming up, so I might make a layer below 'cause it's it easier way to put this branch right behind, so this branch will be coming up like this.",
    "And we're going to Add all kinds of leaves too, so the branches are just.",
    "I like to do them first because I don't know.",
    "It seems logical to me.",
    "I can't figure out where the leaves are going to go until I pick it.",
    "Put the branches I like to do like the skeleton of the tree 1st and then add onto that.",
    "Let's put another little one out here.",
    "Another thing I struggle with sometimes when painting natural things is accidentally making them too perfect.",
    "You know what I mean?",
    "Like matching the shapes of the branches to each other too much.",
    "I want to try to force myself to put like some twigs going in the opposite direction.",
    "You know sometimes it looks a lot more natural if you don't have everything matching everything perfect, because in nature it doesn't look like that, and sometimes even in you have to change something from the reference.",
    "Sometimes even the reference looks too perfect groups would I press.",
    "Press to random shortcut key.",
    "OK, so we've got these altogether.",
    "I think I can turn off my sketch layer now that was the tree was like the last thing that was missing from the sketch.",
    "I think.",
    "Well, we have to still painting the waterfall, but.",
    "Other than that, so I think will will do that, so I'm going to go make a new layer underneath of the tree and work on Darkening some of these areas.",
    "Right now the tree looks like it's awkwardly floating, but if we put some more shadows here, the trees coming close to these rocks and creating a pretty dark shadow there, and so that's going to feel more like it's going to make more sense to be dark in these areas.",
    "Just like the reference were just looking over here, let's see what to do.",
    "And same thing over here, there's a lot of leaves that are going to hang down, but I haven't painted in yet.",
    "So we can kind of paint in some abstract.",
    "Green up here, but the idea is we just want more.",
    "Shadows up here.",
    "And I think that's OK for now.",
    "I'm trying to think what I should maybe I should block in at least block in the waterfall and then work upon the foliage more.",
    "Want to keep painting the tree, but I feel like I don't want to let the waterfall go too too long before we add it.",
    "I try to remind myself to like work around the scene and not take any one area to a very finished place while the other areas need a lot of work.",
    "I think it.",
    "I've noticed that I have better results when I work this way.",
    "I used to really focus in on one little area and make it super detailed and then go to the next area in the next area and I feel like I've gotten better results with my work when it kind of forced myself out of that pattern and try to move around more evenly.",
    "Like spend some time in one area and then leave it move to another area, work on that area.",
    "And just keep working around until everything comes to a finished place, like roughly at the same time as much as possible.",
    "So we'll add the waterfall.",
    "Right now I'm just working on the rock that the the waterfalls cascading over, so I'm going to.",
    "Fix up this area 1st and then we'll add the water.",
    "Not exactly sure how I'm going to do that either.",
    "Hum.",
    "Because I've been making a lot of brushes and there might be some but that work well for this.",
    "If you look at the reference, you'll see that the water is not really white, but more like a shadowy blue color or something like.",
    "This may be a little bit more more blue.",
    "Yeah, so we get a color like this and then we'll add little white highlights, but it's very blue and sometimes you have to even color pic to really see like I've painted a lot of waterfalls so I've started to see this pattern, but.",
    "Proper perspective and everything working out.",
    "All right, so we've got to put a couple pot planters here.",
    "I want to.",
    "Make them pretty.",
    "Big compared to the ones in the back.",
    "Remove this one over.",
    "I'm keeping them on separate layers to start with because it's really nice to be able to move from around like this.",
    "And sort sort that out without having them be merged, and then as soon as we decide where they're going to go.",
    "Merged.",
    "So this one will be a little bit of A.",
    "Warmer color I think mostly because it's closer to the wall with all this bright bounce light.",
    "Yes, that's right, that's right meunier.",
    "You are correct about my color wheel.",
    "If anybody is interested, I put the link to it in the description below the stream.",
    "There's also a discount code.",
    "The color wheel is an external plugin that has some extra options and things.",
    "Not a.",
    "Requirements but.",
    "I like it.",
    "Let's go a little bit a little bit brighter on this one.",
    "Yeah, we're almost there.",
    "Then we gotta put some plants.",
    "I really like the contrast and type of leaves.",
    "These have little bit more almost like tropical leaves.",
    "So I think I might start with just the big.",
    "Green blob.",
    "And then we'll we'll add some more.",
    "Leaves with specific shapes coming out, but I'm going to try to block in a big shape first before I get into individual leaves.",
    "Oh, nice surface perfect.",
    "OK, so we've got a bunch of green here to start with, but now I'm going to take the lasso tool an make these little shapes for these sharp.",
    "Leaves coming out and I'm going to hold shift to keep adding more and more leaves because it's hard to make this whole shape at one time so.",
    "Shift and just add more and more.",
    "Yeah, I think so too.",
    "I think so too.",
    "Is not for free.",
    "Yeah, it's not free the Coulouris.",
    "If you have photo shop, if you have a CC 2019 or later like any more recent versions of photo shop, you can go to window color.",
    "And then you you may be seeing the Hue Cube.",
    "This is the default, but you can.",
    "Go to the color wheel.",
    "You can click this and go to color wheel and then you'll get this one.",
    "So.",
    "That one comes with photo shop, so you don't have to pay extra for it.",
    "It has slightly less.",
    "Some of it doesn't have all of the features of Coulouris, but honestly I don't even use most of these anyway.",
    "I like colors because I like how the interface looks and I like how large it displays the foreground color.",
    "So.",
    "Just arrived from living this painting place.",
    "Reminds me of my hometown.",
    "Hi Eric, thank you.",
    "That's awesome.",
    "I don't know where your hometown is, but this is in Spain, so maybe it's maybe it's close to where you from.",
    "But it seems like you're from a beautiful place.",
    "Almost as a way to contact you if we have questions.",
    "Yeah, so there's so I will put an invite.",
    "I don't know if you use discord, but I have a discord community.",
    "That you might enjoy it to be apart of.",
    "You can share paintings and work in progress and questions with me and a bunch of other artists that are in there and you can send me a private message as well as just joining the actual server and participating in there.",
    "There's lots of tutorials shared and things like that.",
    "Aside from that you can always send me a message here on be hands.",
    "It's really a Gray blue, and it's not too bright at all really, and then some of these really, really bright spots appear will be super bright, so we want to save these bright areas for where we want that most affect splash of light.",
    "So we gotta keep these pretty dark so that that area can stand out.",
    "So that's the plan.",
    "But what?",
    "But what brush?",
    "Hey Matthew are welcome.",
    "I'm doing this on a separate layer so I can erase out if I don't like what I do.",
    "Have that problem to find it hard not to get too focused on details too early.",
    "Ohmygosh that was such a big thing for me and I still have to like consciously work against doing that.",
    "But one of the things that helped was staying zoomed out.",
    "I don't know if this is something that you already do, but.",
    "That's like the biggest thing that helped me was like forcing myself not to zoom in too much.",
    "'cause then you like you can't?",
    "There's only so many details you can do if you stay at like a full view of your image.",
    "So that was like my.",
    "My trick through help avoid doing that 'cause I had no self control like I had to find a way to just not allow myself to do it and that was the so just don't seem in there you go well until the end and then you can zoom in.",
    "OK so I got this brush with some crazy texture.",
    "I'm trying to use to make some splashes.",
    "Also erasing back in towards that texture so that can be a nice way to get some interesting effects so painting and then erasing with a different texture brush.",
    "So I think that's nice because the splash effect here has like a lot of random little spaces in between the droplets and stuff.",
    "So.",
    "I try not to zoom in too much, but then I still want to do details so subconsciously make my brush really small.",
    "You like painting with a one pixel brush like I'm not zoomed in.",
    "It doesn't count.",
    "Hey, that's alright.",
    "I think as long as you're thinking about it and making an effort that's better than than nothing.",
    "Just letting yourself go on autopilot.",
    "I think that's like just one of the biggest things with art.",
    "And with getting better, probably even outside of Art.",
    "But like anything that you're trying to improve on is like keeping that that you're staying conscious with what you're doing.",
    "Instead of like kind of going into autopilot.",
    "Yeah, I hope it helps if anybody, if anybody tries that out.",
    "I'm going to test out a couple different brushes, 'cause I'm still not happy with how the waterfall is looking and I'm trying to create a brush set that's going to give.",
    "It's going to give a wider range of like help with different textures, so I made a brush that was supposed to work for this kind of thing.",
    "I guess we can try it out.",
    "You got the color wheel also nice.",
    "I really hope you enjoy it.",
    "I hope.",
    "I hope it helps.",
    "Makes things a little easier color picking wise.",
    "So this brush is.",
    "Emulating like a splatter texture.",
    "The traditional splatter texture I actually used my watercolors and Gouache paints to make a bunch of splatters.",
    "And then I scanned them and that's how I made this a brush so it's really from traditional textures.",
    "Trying to make it work here.",
    "So far.",
    "I think I might start again.",
    "With the waterfall.",
    "But that's why we do it on this upper layer.",
    "Nice on, I'm really glad you like them.",
    "Thanks for saying so.",
    "Enjoy.",
    "So I think this brushes and ice was the word like compliment.",
    "I don't think this is going to paint the whole waterfall, but I think if we want to add a little extra splatters onto it this would be nice for that purpose.",
    "But I still gotta find.",
    "How to paint this?",
    "The main shape of it.",
    "Yeah, this is nice for a little extra splatter, but it's not doing not going to do it all.",
    "OK, so let's get rid of the other layer.",
    "And I will turn that one off too.",
    "And.",
    "There's a messaging system through this website so you could message me here if you think of something.",
    "When I'm not streaming and you have a urgent question photo shop or at question.",
    "That's that's fine.",
    "You can message me here.",
    "I also stream on Twitch, I do digital painting on Twitch on Tuesdays and Fridays, so if you.",
    "I have something to ask me.",
    "I might also be live at that time just on another another platform so.",
    "You can ask me there too if I'm if I'm live.",
    "You're from Brazil own ice.",
    "Pink colours plugin has much more features.",
    "Yeah, I mean pay that's why they are charging for their thing, right?",
    "You know they design then have been up keeping this so it's not free.",
    "I do think they have a trial and there's a discount code, but Tulip coolers is, uh, something have to purchase.",
    "and I do think it's worth the money.",
    "Personally has been for me, I've been using.",
    "I paid for it once I've been using it for years, so I've been happy with it, but there may be other similar types of color wheel plugins that are free.",
    "I don't know if they would have like all the same.",
    "You know things that color is has, but.",
    "Can we look around?",
    "There's a lot of different ones out there now.",
    "I've heard people talk about a chameleon and stuff like that.",
    "Yeah, it's you definitely get your moneys worth, especially if you're using it for a long time like what I have ended up doing.",
    "I think I bought my cooler is back in like.",
    "2014 or something like that, like I've been using it this whole time so.",
    "Yeah, definitely was worth it.",
    "Oh yeah, I almost forgot that I was working on this plant.",
    "I got totally.",
    "Extracted OK.",
    "So let's see, I'm going to lock the transparency.",
    "So that means this shape that I created.",
    "I'm going to press this little checkerboard icon up here and then I'll be able to paint easily within this shape so I can quickly give a little bit of shading or highlight everyone.",
    "I think of it.",
    "I'm a little bit of color to these individual leaves.",
    "So this is like layer one.",
    "I want to do one more layer of leaves would be a little more natural I think, and some of the leaves have for yellow on them.",
    "So little little plants next to it.",
    "Also make a bunch of selections here.",
    "Just holding shift.",
    "OK.",
    "So let's do layer 2.",
    "So now we can get some more of these, add some foreshortening, some leaves that are kind of angled towards us.",
    "See how this looks.",
    "So I've got selection.",
    "Pick a nice green, yeah, not bad.",
    "If you want for the ones that are kind of coming out from the plants you can give it a little shadow.",
    "Towards the center where it's going deeper.",
    "Yeah, we can add that little bit of yellow stripe to some of the leaves.",
    "That's fun, isn't it?",
    "It's a bit intense, but I think I like it.",
    "So we can do the same to the little one, or we can have them be two different types, and maybe this one doesn't have the yellow.",
    "I think I like the yellow though.",
    "Let's let's do it.",
    "All right?",
    "So I think I like this overall, although the this spot I feel like I should make it a little bit darker.",
    "Let's try this one.",
    "Thank you for the next comments you guys and thanks for being patient.",
    "Will figure out how to how to do this.",
    "That's a painting.",
    "There's a lot of trial and error so.",
    "And tried different eraser.",
    "We basically we want to get that effect of the water being more together as it's about to Cascade over the waterfall and then kind of.",
    "Falling apart kind of all these little space is coming between there and just kind of tumbling over.",
    "I like these kind of like Kris Kross.",
    "Affects that I'm seeing.",
    "It's because of the water, the water, the properties of water, the water tension, like little droplets, are kind of trying to stick to each other, even as they're falling down.",
    "So.",
    "And we've got water coming over the rock here, and it's very much.",
    "And shadow, we get these purple Blues in the area.",
    "Back here is going to have a bright light hitting.",
    "I think it's going to be nice.",
    "Let's start getting some of that color in.",
    "It would be satisfying.",
    "Funny facts first ever.",
    "Photo shop had only one undo.",
    "Oh, that's definitely hard mode.",
    "Only one control Z.",
    "What are so hard to paint it is it is really hard to paint and I love painting it but.",
    "I also find it difficult.",
    "Uh-huh",
    "Yeah, I will be painting the bright spot.",
    "I tend to douche midtones then.",
    "Shadows and highlights.",
    "So sometimes the highlights come like as the last step.",
    "So.",
    "We will get there.",
    "Do use the dropper.",
    "Told the sample colors from reference photos I don't.",
    "I also don't have a problem with people doing it or think it's like sometimes people have strong opinion on this and think that you shouldn't do it.",
    "I personally don't think it's a problem to do it necessarily, but the reason I don't do it is because I'm trying to practice.",
    "Picking my own colors and I want more freedom.",
    "Like when I first started doing digital painting, I had to really color pic from the photos because I couldn't choose my own colors.",
    "I just they were totally off when I would try to do it an after doing a lot of these studies an.",
    "Practicing just looking at the color and trying to select it for myself, I slowly got better with that and I feel a lot more freedom in my painting now like I can choose my own colors.",
    "It helps me understand color theory better and it's just been more fun by project.",
    "Have a good rest of your day.",
    "Thanks for hanging out.",
    "So yeah, I tried to not call her pick from the reference just for my own.",
    "Just to get better at choosing the colours myself, and it's definitely been beneficial, is like feel like I can paint a lot faster now.",
    "Because of that.",
    "And less restricted love digital painting too.",
    "Yeah I do.",
    "I love digital painting and I also love traditional painting.",
    "I get a lot of questions about like which one do I like best and I find it really, really hard to pick because I really like I really like both and I would never want to give up either.",
    "And I like doing both 'cause I feel like it kind of.",
    "I get inspiration from one and I want to try things in the other.",
    "It's part of the reason that my I've been going for this really traditional work in my digital paintings from Thanksgiving traditional painting and then kind of falling in love with that.",
    "Wanting those textures here.",
    "I'm going to go back to my original brush that I was using to paint this whole scene to begin with.",
    "Think that'll help me give me more consistency.",
    "And here's a bright.",
    "Here's the bright spot.",
    "Well, one of the bright spots we were waiting for.",
    "That should help.",
    "We're going to add a bunch of little shines and things here, so it'll be almost pireway for those.",
    "Yeah, that was a little bit more in the Shadow and we're having kind of the same issue with the pots as with the chairs earlier they need a little bit of shading underneath of them for it to feel a bit more convincing.",
    "I think that they're really sitting on the ground, so.",
    "Will put some little shadows and maybe blend them in after, so I'm just going to pop them in here first.",
    "And then.",
    "Maybe we can do a little blending 'cause it seems kind of.",
    "Stark.",
    "Little shadow behind them on the wall.",
    "Yeah, that's true for a lot of things.",
    "We're including Workflow.",
    "Sometimes you make decisions about how you work based on what's comfortable to you sometimes.",
    "People will suggest so you can do it better this way or easier this way and.",
    "It's always good to consider those things.",
    "So it's good to be willing to try something new, but if you're if you're really more comfortable doing it the old way and you're able to still get a good results and everything, sometimes you do things the in a longer way, for example, because you like to do it that way, and that's OK too.",
    "You have to be comfortable in your process.",
    "You have to be having fun.",
    "I think that's also important.",
    "Results are important, but enjoying your work is important too, especially in the long run.",
    "I'm going to put a little bit of warmer light on the tree.",
    "The tree is getting hit with really really bright light and in my version I didn't quite go.",
    "That far with it, but I think it looks nice.",
    "And it it makes sense based on the chairs and everything else the light shining on, it makes sense.",
    "This tree.",
    "It's getting.",
    "Some little splashes.",
    "This is fantastic that I caught the live feed high Adam, thank you.",
    "Having so much fun with your Ghibli brushes, their amazing thanks.",
    "So you're very welcome.",
    "And thank you for purchasing them.",
    "I'm really, really glad to hear you like them and you're having fun with them.",
    "Thanks for joining the stream too.",
    "I can show you and anyone else who is kind of getting here.",
    "Now I'll give you a quick recap of the painting process.",
    "We can go back in time I tried to save and you knew layers every so often.",
    "So I tried to build this up a little bit more like a traditional painting because I wanted to get that kind of look at the end result that it was more of a pain through painterly feeling.",
    "So I'm pretty happy with it.",
    "Overall, my complaint at this moment.",
    "Is.",
    "Everything seems very like over on the left and I think maybe I could try zooming in a little bit.",
    "Do you guys see what I mean?",
    "Like I feel as if it's just.",
    "Everything is too.",
    "There's too much blank space.",
    "So maybe zooming in a little bit feels better.",
    "And also maybe I can do something more with the shadows on the ground over here to help direct RI back in towards the right, like have the shadows kind of pointing back in on the grounds.",
    "Maybe I could add some little random leaves on the ground or something.",
    "There's some dead leaves, you know, just it's a bit stark.",
    "I think the pavement, the patio pavement.",
    "Maybe I could add more texture to it.",
    "The the pavement has a lot more little grooves and things in it than what I currently have, so those are some ideas.",
    "Let's try first with the shadow.",
    "So there's a shadow coming in.",
    "I'm going to do a little smudge.",
    "On it.",
    "Maybe lower the opacity.",
    "It was easier for me to paint it in pretty dark so I could see clearly, but I don't think it needs to be so dark.",
    "Let's flip.",
    "Good call.",
    "Thanks Ryan.",
    "Little shadow there and we kind of do the opposite, so that's overlay mode so I can also add highlights with it, and I think making that little splash of light back here at tiny bit more dramatic might also be fun.",
    "Is there somewhere we can use your brushes in illustrator?",
    "I don't think so unfortunately on, but I I don't use illustrator.",
    "I don't have a lot of knowledge about how it works or if you can use the brushes in there, but to my knowledge I don't think you can use Photoshop brushes in illustrator, but maybe.",
    "I'm wrong, anybody can correct me, but I don't think you can.",
    "All thank you asthma.",
    "Well if you have any questions, you're welcome to ask me.",
    "I'm happy if I can answer them.",
    "I don't know all the answers.",
    "As with songs question, I'm sorry, but I know more with photo shop then the other programs I've used illustrator along time ago.",
    "But it really was a while ago.",
    "And I don't remember a lot.",
    "It was very briefly.",
    "So right now I'm painting these highlights, hitting the side of the rock over here.",
    "Remember lights coming from the back shining through these areas are getting a lot of bright.",
    "Pops of light and I'm a big fan of how this how the green is bright green looks when the lights shining on it and love that color.",
    "It's very lively.",
    "Here too.",
    "Little little bit so far.",
    "Plants, analogy and all kinds of stuff.",
    "Growing here.",
    "So we still have that other layer, that splash layer will see if we end up using that.",
    "How do you keep the reference photo of you on photo shop?",
    "Well, that's a good question, so it's not part of Photoshop.",
    "This is a separate.",
    "Um?",
    "App or program and let me get the link to it.",
    "It's called pure ref.",
    "Is very popular actually for.",
    "Organizing reference images and making like mood boards and reference sheets and stuff.",
    "All at it below the stream in the description.",
    "But yeah, it's called pure if you can download it for free.",
    "I think that they leave it up to you if you want to make a donation or not when you download the program, so you can choose to do that if you want, but I think you can download it for free.",
    "Ah, thanks Sarah, you're welcome.",
    "I try.",
    "I tried to organise them like the more brushes you have, the more you need to organize them or else you can never find anything.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Alright, little down over here.",
    "Rock as well as the.",
    "Green",
    "And put some.",
    "Put some little noisy texture on this too.",
    "Bright greens And appear too can be a little later, I think.",
    "So we went from using the same brush for quite a lot of this too.",
    "Now I'm like trying every brush trying to figure out what nice little textures we can get in.",
    "It's not necessarily super efficient to do this, but when you are trying to get that look at traditional look.",
    "Sometimes you gotta mess around with these different textures.",
    "Hi Gary.",
    "Thank you, thank you very much.",
    "I'm glad you're enjoying the stream.",
    "I will post a link in chat for you.",
    "This is a blog that talks a lot about different tablets in different price ranges and.",
    "Hey clever.",
    "Been lurking in and out.",
    "It's been interesting to see this like you captured in the layers.",
    "Real pretty outcome too.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Yeah, I hope I can maybe upload that little step by step thing.",
    "At the end.",
    "I don't always remember to take little steps.",
    "Little.",
    "It always remember to keep those aside.",
    "But I was able to remember today.",
    "But thanks, I'm glad you find it interesting and that you like the results.",
    "So far.",
    "I'm trying to pull it together here with like the last little things to make it feel complete.",
    "I hope your day is going well.",
    "Now I'm like second guessing five zoomed in too much.",
    "I think it's fine, it's probably fine.",
    "Let's put a little bit more light here.",
    "I was trying to do that with overlay.",
    "It didn't really work.",
    "Let's try linear Dodge.",
    "I put my.",
    "Brush and my.",
    "Layer blending mode on linear Dodge.",
    "Do you choose not to include the sign on the wall because it would look better without it?",
    "How do you decide what to include or not?",
    "That's a good question.",
    "Uh, so for me.",
    "There's a few things that can help me decide.",
    "Sometimes they just go with like, my personal preferences are instincts like.",
    "If I think something, it might be really distracting to have in the scene, or just didn't look great in the reference.",
    "Or I don't mind this sign.",
    "I just.",
    "It didn't seem super important to me, and it seemed kind of it wasn't like really, really pretty.",
    "It's not like ugly either.",
    "It's blue.",
    "It's not really bad color, but sometimes when I'm painting scenes I leave out some of the man made elements that are not so aesthetic like signs or a little garbage bins or something like that.",
    "Sometimes I'll add them and sometimes not.",
    "So a little bit of romanticizing the scene, I guess, but now that you mention it and I'm looking over there, this the sign might be a really nice way to bring in a little bit of the blue over to the left because it seems very very like.",
    "Blue, blue and then pink side side.",
    "So maybe the maybe the sign would be nice to add.",
    "I didn't add the bicycle because I felt like it was getting a little bit too busy with the bicycle overlapping the chairs and I've got the chairs just worked well enough as a focus point so.",
    "I didn't include the bicycle on purpose.",
    "I think the sign I might try adding in you can tell me what you think.",
    "If you think it looks good.",
    "Hey, Machiavelli, welcome.",
    "Yeah, I just go with instinct and trial and error.",
    "Luckily because this is photo shop and not a traditional painting, I can easily just try something and see if it looks good and if I don't like it then we just gone.",
    "Out with the layer.",
    "Wow, that's intense.",
    "Let's try a little darker color.",
    "Hi Tyson Alright, well my sign is not necessarily the same proportions.",
    "As the one in the reference.",
    "But I can just scribble in something that looks like text here.",
    "What do you guys think?",
    "Do you think it's too intense?",
    "The color might be.",
    "Let me lower the saturation a little bit.",
    "I don't know if it's just doing too much, but I think I like it.",
    "Uh, I'm not sure.",
    "I'm going to try making a layer on color Dodge and adding a little bit of highlights on to it.",
    "So that it kind of matches the area around it.",
    "Maybe that's it's looking out of place because it doesn't have any highlights.",
    "Their screen, tablets, and.",
    "Regular tablets and all kinds of things.",
    "I find it difficult to recommend 1 tablet for anyone because there's so many things regarding your individual budget and stuff that can come into play and how much you think that you would prefer screen tablet versus a regular tablet.",
    "But check out that link.",
    "Um, if you're looking for a screen tablet, the.",
    "The the some of the less expensive ones would be XP pen and Huey and I've heard good things about them.",
    "I'm using a welcome which is which I love, but it's a little bit more expensive, so if you're just starting I would say.",
    "If you're looking for, if you want the quality of welcome, you could try an intuos or something like that.",
    "Those are there types that don't have a screen, but they have great pressure sensitivity.",
    "And.",
    "Yeah, it's just.",
    "It's really hard to pick a tablet for someone because there's so many little things to consider, but I hope that that blog helps you make a more informed decision.",
    "Jackson says, not sure how to tackle the leaves while keeping the painting kind of loose.",
    "You have some plans for that.",
    "Not yet, but the previous painting.",
    "This area, I think worked out pretty well so.",
    "Maybe I'll do a combination of a brush and then some selections.",
    "Basically the way the leaves look here, I think I'd be pretty happy with something similar to that on this one.",
    "So maybe a brush?",
    "To start with and then some individual painted leaves on top to like clean up a couple.",
    "Where do you find your reference photos?",
    "I will post in the chat.",
    "Pexels, unsplash, pixabay, word file.",
    "These are the most mostly the ones that I use.",
    "Haley arts and good morning.",
    "Like you're hearing on tablets.",
    "Thanks for Chiming in.",
    "Those of you who have different tablets and.",
    "Have an opinion one way or the other toys?",
    "Nice to share.",
    "We've had this conversation a couple of times today and don't feel bad about asking.",
    "Important question when you're first getting into stuff.",
    "If you look below the stream in the description, there's a link it says resources page or resources that also has a bunch of links to tablet related information beyond just the.",
    "The one that I posted in the chat, so there's more stuff there, as well as just general tutorials and things.",
    "Hi Gina, I am.",
    "I'm using the Centriq 22.",
    "The welcome Cindy 22 is the tablet that I have.",
    "So that is a screen tablet.",
    "Alright, maybe we should, uh, paint.",
    "Some of those leaves soon.",
    "I want to work on the waterfall a little bit more because I feel like I'm still still haven't figured that out yet.",
    "Can you show how you draw?",
    "Yeah, just hang out and watch.",
    "That's what I've been doing.",
    "If you want to see from the beginning.",
    "I started this from a blank white canvas, so after the stream it usually takes a couple hours for the stream to process and then it's available.",
    "If you go to my profile and click the videos tab, you can watch any of my past livestreams there and I always start from a blank canvas and show the whole painting process as I create something and I try to explain as I go.",
    "So if you want to watch any of those then yeah then you can see.",
    "Unless you're asking like to see my tablet like maybe if that's what you're saying when you say show you trying to see the tablet since we're talking about tablets.",
    "I don't have an easy way of doing it without disrupting my whole camera setup, so I'm sorry I do have.",
    "If you look at my Instagram link below the description.",
    "Of the stream, if you Scroll down quite a bit on my Instagram, there is a photo of my setup so you can get an idea of what it looks like.",
    "But I don't have an easy way of showing it right now without messing up everything.",
    "I need to take a new picture.",
    "4.",
    "For that purpose soon it's been awhile.",
    "But yeah, I'll just type it in the chat.",
    "Thank you Tyson, that's very nice of you.",
    "It looks realistic.",
    "You like the sign?",
    "OK Harry, I'm really glad you asked about the sign.",
    "We gave it another chance because of your question.",
    "I think it helps bring the blue into this side of the canvas 'cause it was a bit we were missing that there's two things I did that started eliminating blue from this side of the scene.",
    "One is the.",
    "One is the I didn't put in the little garbage cans.",
    "There's like little garbage cans.",
    "Maybe I can add just one of them.",
    "Well, I think that's what they are down here.",
    "The got little garbage cans.",
    "They have a little plastic.",
    "On them like a white plastic, but look at how blue.",
    "The shadow is.",
    "Look at that.",
    "Look at that blue and then look at the blue reflection on these.",
    "I didn't get these plants in yet, so.",
    "All of that missing blue.",
    "That's definitely yeah.",
    "If we add that in, it helps to tie it in.",
    "OK.",
    "So maybe I can use the eraser to give these little.",
    "Kind of crazy details the trash can has all these little swirly mesh details.",
    "Like the addition of the blue and pink, but it might be a bit vibrant.",
    "Yeah, it's a bit intense.",
    "I think it's partially because my pink was like so so bright here.",
    "Maybe if I.",
    "Turn it down a little bit.",
    "Jackson says looks amazing.",
    "Maddie here's my take.",
    "Well, thank you first of all, and let me check it out.",
    "I went with a bicycle.",
    "It looks so good.",
    "This is a really strong one, Jackson.",
    "What a cool choice.",
    "You get one of the chairs in the table, but focusing on the bike and what are beautifully painted bike, I can't believe you did this in such a short time I really love it.",
    "Love the color dynamics.",
    "Brushes beautiful feeling of light shining through.",
    "Is awesome.",
    "Really really nice work.",
    "Thank you for painting with us.",
    "Yeah, it definitely feels complete.",
    "Alright, let's add little bag on top of here.",
    "So there's two little garbage cans.",
    "I'm just going to add 1, but I'm trying to figure out where to put it.",
    "I think that's fine.",
    "That's fine.",
    "There.",
    "So that brings in a little bit of blue, and then we'll have some little flower pots on the table.",
    "I think I might select.",
    "I might just use the lasso tool to select the shape of little pots.",
    "That's going to be easy way to get a nice sharp shape.",
    "So I got 1 two.",
    "Paint those in.",
    "And they are metallic, which means they reflect a lot of light from around here and every other color that's around it so.",
    "Can color pic from the wall.",
    "Like mostly Gray.",
    "But with a nice blue.",
    "Reflected light.",
    "And these are kind of recognisable little pots they have.",
    "what I have.",
    "So if you look it up you know you'll see what it looks like.",
    "Yeah, no worries.",
    "This is getting a little little muddy in the waterfall area here, but.",
    "We will.",
    "Continue anyway.",
    "Trying to figure it out.",
    "So I think having vertical strokes is important to look like it's falling down.",
    "Give the effect of gravity, but then we also want little splash effects coming off.",
    "Thank you, Maarten.",
    "Thank you very much.",
    "I think this one is maybe going to be my favorite from today actually, just.",
    "I can figure out what to do with the waterfall.",
    "Then I'll be happy.",
    "But hey, that's what we do studies for so we can studies are basically like troubleshooting.",
    "There's always going to be something that you can't figure out how to do, and you've got to try a bunch of different methods and then eventually you get it, and then that was the point.",
    "That was the point, right?",
    "Those appointed doing studies, although it's always nice when everything goes smoothly, but I think you learn the most when you have these kind of moments and you have to.",
    "Try things out.",
    "Thanks, Shama, that's that's what I'm trying.",
    "I'm trying to go for that.",
    "In the past my style was a little bit more realistic I guess.",
    "But I I really love the idea of just capturing the mood of a scene instead of painting it super super realistically.",
    "So I've been trying to work on that even though my natural tendencies are to just like copy the reference.",
    "But I've been trying to to avoid just copying the reference.",
    "Try to put a little bit of my own style into it.",
    "All right, so we've got the waterfall tumbling over from the side.",
    "How many waterfalls sounds refreshing?",
    "It is going to be refreshing, I hope.",
    "Try out those splatter brushes when were time.",
    "I've got some.",
    "Brushes that might work that have little dots, textures and things.",
    "We'll see.",
    "Got some splatters.",
    "Works pretty well.",
    "Oh thank you mother ship.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Hear that.",
    "Yeah, this splatter brushes nice.",
    "The waterfall is really splashing alot like it's very Misty and.",
    "Splash explosion, sometimes in waterfalls.",
    "The water is like one thick stream, but this one is very splashy, so I want to get that look.",
    "That's what the speed sketches are for.",
    "Oftentimes a technique is stumbled upon that can create certain texture for another project exactly exactly.",
    "It's always a good feeling when you find something like that.",
    "Thanks Julie and enjoy the rest of your day.",
    "Thanks for hanging out with us.",
    "Have to get back to work.",
    "This is my learning lunch break.",
    "Really enjoyed watching and learning from you.",
    "Will def watch rest later.",
    "Also I'm thanks Sarah.",
    "I really appreciate the kind words and the company enjoy the rest of your day.",
    "And we'll see you later.",
    "For anybody who is knew, I stream every Wednesday at the same time.",
    "So also you can find me back here.",
    "Be hands next Wednesday as well.",
    "Love the energy of the slashes.",
    "Yes, yes, thank you.",
    "I'm trying to get that started off.",
    "Little bit of struggle, but we're getting there getting there Hiriko, I'm going to flip the canvas.",
    "I think it's been too long from one side and this might help.",
    "This might refresh our view a little bit.",
    "Let's flip it.",
    "Hi Bernadette, thank you.",
    "Thank you.",
    "I think having a little bit of.",
    "This common pattern of a little little rings around.",
    "I think a lot of us have seen these types of little flower containers.",
    "So something like that.",
    "Not too crazy and then we can put a little planes coming out.",
    "These little details I think you know they take time, but it really helps the scene feel alive and.",
    "Cheerful little flower pots on the table is a.",
    "Worth the effort.",
    "Hi Richard.",
    "Welcome.",
    "Still going to paint in some.",
    "Green leaves.",
    "I'm going to go.",
    "To a lighter, warmer color, green working their way up.",
    "Love painting plants and.",
    "I really like the effect of.",
    "You see, with like the warmer green at the top and then in the shadowed areas, there's always going to be some cooler greens and little blue reflected lights and things like that.",
    "I also have a.",
    "I have some brushes that have little leaf effects so could also use those.",
    "But sometimes for a little situation like this, it's nice to do some of it hand painted.",
    "Unique, unique look.",
    "Thanks Mina Horse.",
    "I'm ready to put in some bright pink Flowers on the table here.",
    "So I'll grab the back to my basic brush and we want a nice.",
    "Maybe we can sort of tie in this.",
    "Yeah, this bright pink.",
    "Oh, that makes me really happy.",
    "So cheerful.",
    "I'm going to add more Flowers than what it actually has in the picture.",
    "Ah.",
    "Look at that.",
    "Perfect.",
    "Thanks a lot of the challenging reference, but I enjoy painting along.",
    "Love how you turned out.",
    "Now I can look at it much more calmly and appreciate even wear your brushwork.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Know you're not a rushing along next to us.",
    "Thank you.",
    "1 area I didn't get to do yet which needs some.",
    "Love is over here on these these windows.",
    "I gotta paint the bars in here so I'll do that on the separate layer.",
    "Alright, I'm not going to go for the an identical look to the reference, I'm just going to try to make something that looks nice.",
    "I'm going to put some different thicknesses to the window bars.",
    "Hi Jay, as I call you, how are you?",
    "Even that might be too not enough space in between them.",
    "Hum.",
    "My Windows didn't really come out the right proportions.",
    "Let's make these little smaller.",
    "Oh, welcome back.",
    "More near sorry about the tech difficulties for you.",
    "Some holding shift to make these lines perfectly straight.",
    "It happens to be.",
    "It's really handy that.",
    "The angle of my.",
    "Photo and everything.",
    "It works out that I can just hold shift sometimes.",
    "It's not so easy to use that.",
    "And it works out perfectly here.",
    "I might have to alter this color.",
    "It might be a little too dark for this area that I'm painting it right now, but I'm just going to worry about shape first.",
    "Just put in detail and then we'll go back and.",
    "Painting the water and then painting the background color back in is helping to make things not so precise and a little bit more chaotic.",
    "'cause That's the big thing that's hard to capture about this.",
    "This waterfall is like there's a lot of little.",
    "It's a little bit chaotic, but you still have gravity pulling it down in.",
    "There's some kind of order.",
    "Not much of a balance.",
    "Ha ha ha.",
    "Hey Gary and thanks for coming over welcome.",
    "Yeah, so paint in and then paint over it would be kind of the same idea if you're erasing out.",
    "So the idea is creating a shape with the brush and then kind of cutting back into that shape.",
    "To change it up a little bit.",
    "And these little spaces in between the water.",
    "Not quite there yet.",
    "There's also these little like they're kind of connected these little.",
    "Crisscross openings It's not important effect is having these enclosed little circles.",
    "Maggie Valley says I can easily imagine some fantasy adventure characters approaching the waterfall, as if there's something magical about it.",
    "Cat Biggs I think.",
    "I think the like bright light up here helps 'cause like you get that a lot in games and movies when there's like a magical something magical about that.",
    "Whatever it is, it's going to have that nice Mr.",
    "Gold glow.",
    "The light perfectly hitting it.",
    "Get that idea.",
    "OK, well I think I actually like that enough to merge it down and say, OK, we're going.",
    "We're going somewhere.",
    "New layer I want to add this splash down here where the water was hitting the water.",
    "This.",
    "So we're going to do the same thing and start with a like a blue.",
    "Color this is basically what the water looks like in Shadow, and then we're going to add.",
    "Some highlights.",
    "So we'll add the bright, almost white.",
    "Thanks Makaveli.",
    "I'm really glad this one so.",
    "Turning out well.",
    "Another thing that you can do is since we've got this on its own layer right now, we can lock the layer and we can.",
    "Paint inside of that with a different brush so we can really.",
    "Bring it up with something softer.",
    "I think that might be a nice look.",
    "Got a little bit darker.",
    "Below here.",
    "We have some really warm greens in the water here.",
    "Oh Pablos, that's so nice of you, really.",
    "Yeah, it should take only like 10 minutes for you to be allowed to post in there.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Made a quick many design with the font.",
    "I mean that's awesome.",
    "Well I'm excited to see it when it when it allows you to post.",
    "Had some great greens, little little splashes of color in here.",
    "Worry about the color.",
    "Missed last 10 minutes.",
    "Well, we did some details on the Flowers and stuff, but you came back at a good time.",
    "Danner Pride Hi Welcome.",
    "How have you been?",
    "Trying to consider the perspective and like roughly what kind of angle I should have for these windows.",
    "These little details.",
    "There's also some little swirls and things I'm just going to be really casual about scribbling them in.",
    "I don't think we need to be super precise for us to get the feeling of what kind of designs this would be, you know.",
    "Just some simple little swirls.",
    "There we go.",
    "Thanks red.",
    "Thank you, thank you Dana.",
    "My reference images in the description below the stream if you or anyone's curious, check it out.",
    "It's a really pretty scene, so I've enjoyed painting a lot.",
    "The only part I didn't really enjoy that much was painting the chairs.",
    "The chairs felt a little tedious, but.",
    "Otherwise.",
    "This has been one of my favorite ones to do here, I think.",
    "All right, before we merge this, I want to take the opportunity to paint any extra things below that.",
    "So I'm going to be merging the other things we did.",
    "But below the.",
    "Bars that a time where I can say OK.",
    "There's a.",
    "There's an extra little.",
    "Detail here, they didn't paint in before.",
    "Little bright highlight.",
    "So once we merge these down, it's going to be harder for me to pay anything behind there.",
    "So I'm going to lock the transparency.",
    "And grab a lighter color.",
    "Color of the.",
    "Light hitting these bars whoops.",
    "And just paint that on top.",
    "I've gotta find the right colour though.",
    "It's going to be really bright.",
    "That might work.",
    "It's not fun, so it's not going to be everywhere, it's the dappled.",
    "Lighting is also hitting these, so if you want to add some, leave some areas darker than that works.",
    "Do the whole thing Bray, this all pretty bright.",
    "And then over here it's more of a dappled situation.",
    "The green probably should be later.",
    "Over on this one, there's just so much bounce like going on even.",
    "Even in the shadows it should probably be a little later than what I had.",
    "Alright, that's better.",
    "The chairs, that's why only painted one ha so smart.",
    "That's what I should have done.",
    "Who?",
    "Yeah, so lightning up some of that a little bit.",
    "Selecting the wrong brush.",
    "Oh, good luck red.",
    "Have fun.",
    "I hope it goes well.",
    "Thanks for hanging out.",
    "Alright, I'm going to merge those down now.",
    "What can we do to finish this up?",
    "I think the floor we can add some more.",
    "There's actually a lot of little ripples catching the light.",
    "Not sure if there's a way for me to kind of indicate that without painting at all, 'cause it seems like a lot.",
    "I want to see.",
    "Alright, let's leave the waterfall for a little bit and work on the top, because like I said earlier, I'm going to try not to go too detailed on any part of the scene.",
    "While other areas are falling behind and right now, I think the top needs a little bit of love with the all the leaves and stuff on there, so let's work on that.",
    "So I'm going to make a new layer underneath of the.",
    "The branch and.",
    "My idea will see if it's going to work is I have a brush that does.",
    "Some leaf textures and things, so I might begin with that.",
    "It's a pretty abstract look.",
    "So that will work here I think.",
    "And we can begin with this kind of.",
    "Texture and then paint on top will paint some individual leaves to kind of give it a more crisp look.",
    "This will be our starting point.",
    "So we want to add some different greens.",
    "It's a bunch of different greens in the reference.",
    "Blue greens A lot of it is pretty dark because there.",
    "The lights coming from behind and then the.",
    "Leaves are blocking it.",
    "So it's kind of a shadow depending on where the lights hitting this can produce really really bright leaves, but these are mostly mostly creating dark, so the way.",
    "And that makes a lot more sense.",
    "The lighting on the.",
    "The rock up here now that we have these leaves kind of makes sense that they're blocking some of the light and causing this patchy patchy lay situation.",
    "The leaves come down over here around.",
    "I'll try to be brave.",
    "Some of these need to be really, really dark and it feels like a bit extreme, but I think it will make more sense if we do some really dark ones.",
    "Feels more.",
    "Yeah, I just feels more lush, feels more like we're in this enclosed kind of place.",
    "Leaves pointing in towards the focal point.",
    "So I'm going to merge all the leaf layers until one this.",
    "And we can go to image, adjust Hue, saturation again like lighten them or add more saturation or shift the Hue.",
    "But I think I'm overall like happy with how it is.",
    "And then I will go on top of this layer and now we can make some of our own leaves too, 'cause these leaves in the image, they have a specific look.",
    "So what I'm doing is just taking the lasso tool and selecting.",
    "Based on the reference how the leaves look, the shape of them.",
    "I'm not sure the name of this type of tree.",
    "Maybe you guys recognize it, but I've definitely seen these before.",
    "And then we can fill it in.",
    "So then you get this kind of look.",
    "The downside to this is it's very.",
    "It can be sort of a digital look, depending on how the shapes that you make, because you get that very, very crisp lasso tool outline.",
    "One thing that you can do to help with that is lock the layer and use a textured brush of some kind to paint inside of there so we could choose something with like a canvas E texture or something like that, and then paint in that shape and that can be kind of cool, but I don't know.",
    "I don't think it's too bad.",
    "I don't think it's too obvious.",
    "I don't know.",
    "Let's just keep painting and see how it goes.",
    "There's other ways to paint it into the scene.",
    "So we'll get to that.",
    "And try them out.",
    "But I think I'm basically just going to add a bunch of little leaves like this.",
    "Oops, wrong brush.",
    "Uncheck the lot of transparency in paint a bunch in like that.",
    "Brush work down here.",
    "So there's not much interesting going on.",
    "In this on the floor, so there's there's some little dried leaves and stuff, but I'm hoping that maybe I can make some interesting paint strokes.",
    "This is supposed to look like more like a traditional painting.",
    "So I'm hoping I can when I'm painting in some shadows and things here on the ground that can maybe make some interesting marks that might help it somehow.",
    "I have some canvas textured brushes but I don't know if that's a good direction at this stage in the painting 'cause there's.",
    "Not a lot of it elsewhere.",
    "Do you think it might be one of those situations where I need to come back and take a fresh look at this?",
    "After a little bit of a break for me, the painting is just about finished.",
    "I wanted this to be a study.",
    "This isn't the Super super polished piece and I'm pretty happy with the lighting and everything.",
    "So what I might do is, after last little little touches I might end it here and then.",
    "After a little bit of a break, come back and look and see if maybe I get some different ideas with the floor and I can do something just a little spiff it up a little bit, but at the moment.",
    "I don't not really getting too much.",
    "Love the Dappled Light.",
    "The scene is so great.",
    "Odd, dappled light.",
    "Thank you James.",
    "Maybe maybe I could add some more light onto the floor.",
    "Maybe that would be interesting.",
    "So floors just got nothing going on right now.",
    "I probably should have thought of that issue earlier, but for some reason in the reference image it doesn't bother me.",
    "But maybe I can add some little.",
    "Flashes of light on the ground.",
    "Somewhere.",
    "Like leading in towards the.",
    "I don't know if it feels believable.",
    "I don't know.",
    "Thanks, Harry, thank you.",
    "I think I will leave it as it is for now and then.",
    "I might I might go back and add some dappled light or something.",
    "I'm just going to take a fresh look at it.",
    "Susan says.",
    "Looks finished to me.",
    "I think it could be finished.",
    "I'm not sure if I'm overthinking it or not.",
    "But Yeah, I think I think I might end this one here for now.",
    "So from the beginning we could skip through this real quick.",
    "It was a different kind of process for me.",
    "Usually I sketch before getting into the painting.",
    "It worked out pretty well considering I didn't do a sketch beforehand, like we didn't end up with anything super super out of place.",
    "Sign it package called done.",
    "Cool alright yeah I will.",
    "When I when I when I look at this one and decide it's finished I think I'll post this one here on be hands think I like it enough that I'll post it sometimes they don't post all the studies that we do.",
    "Thank you Dana Project, a tiny one.",
    "Very small.",
    "Thank you JS, thank you.",
    "Machiavelli.",
    "Yeah, I'll post this on my probably my Instagram and my account here so you can see the finished one.",
    "Go get that cup of coffee that sounds good.",
    "Thank you so much.",
    "This was a really fun stream.",
    "I enjoyed the painting a lot.",
    "I think this is one of my favorite ones to do here so.",
    "Thank you for all the nice comments and company.",
    "I really appreciate it.",
    "I stream here every Wednesday.",
    "This stream is actually like a little bit on the shorter side.",
    "I might stream a little bit longer next time I like to do generally like to do a couple paintings, sometimes one, sometimes 2, sometimes 3.",
    "I did enjoy the workflow, it was very.",
    "It was fun.",
    "It was fun to work like this without the sketch.",
    "It doesn't take too much, so my idea is one thing you can do to make it feel more painterly is then take another brush.",
    "An paint on top.",
    "So if you look at the reference some of these leaves actually quite a lot of them have bounce light, like a teal blue bounce light.",
    "So if we paint on top like this.",
    "We're adding that little bounce light that little highlight on the leaf, and so it kind of makes it look a little bit more hand painted.",
    "'cause you're adding a little hand painted element to it.",
    "These over here I kind of like those two twigs like not having any leaves on them.",
    "I like that being kind of sparse up there.",
    "I'm not sure.",
    "Just put these guys somewhere.",
    "Yeah, I like that better.",
    "I like this just pointing out.",
    "OK, here it is.",
    "Fairly basic though, so don't get overrides OK, let's see.",
    "Oh you pick my favorite colors by the way.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Super cool yeah.",
    "The teal teal blue.",
    "Gradients I'm a fan.",
    "Maybe you notice that by some of my other like branding stuff I don't know, but nice color choice and thank you.",
    "How sweet of you.",
    "I'm going to add some were shadows over here.",
    "I'm just realizing this could be a little darker.",
    "So I'm kind of in the stage where now I feel a little bit more like everything is at least present right.",
    "The waterfall is there, the trees there.",
    "So now I can kind of move around the scene as I want and clean things up, add more details and just have fun painting around and.",
    "Polishing I guess we're in the polishing phase now.",
    "I think we can definitely use some layer blending modes to bump up the drama.",
    "In this one.",
    "We can definitely do that.",
    "Nice well.",
    "It's a great color, great color combo.",
    "Blue Antilock Wise.",
    "Always been my favorite color but I'm starting to starting also.",
    "Really love green as you may be compelled from these kind of paintings that I do.",
    "I really love green also, but blue was always my favorite from childhood to now.",
    "So at this phase I'm also trying to stay pretty zoomed out because I'm trying to see how everything's working together.",
    "We did zoom in a couple times, we zoomed in on the waterfall and we zoomed in on the trees and so was treating some of that stuff on top, but now we are back to zooming out and trying to take in the whole scene here and make sure it makes sense.",
    "Altogether.",
    "I'm a really big fan of dry brushing in traditional, so I try to.",
    "I like to get that kind of look.",
    "I'm trying to figure out how to do that in.",
    "My digital work too.",
    "Let's do a little bit of.",
    "Layer layer blending modes and stuff like that, and then we'll.",
    "Will keep painting.",
    "So.",
    "I'm going to make a new layer and I think basically what I'm looking for is color.",
    "Dodge will put a layer on color Dodge.",
    "I'm going to double click that layer an unchecked transparency shapes layer.",
    "I do this almost every time that I use color Dodge 'cause I prefer the look when that is unchecked, so we'll go to the airbrush.",
    "I almost always use the Airbrush when I do these kind of little effects.",
    "So I'm just going to choose a bright warm color.",
    "And just pop that in.",
    "And you can see how it's going to overexpose really, really quickly.",
    "So we gotta be careful, but just a little bit like this.",
    "And here at the waterfall.",
    "And put a little bit of light right on those splashes.",
    "And anywhere that you want it to feel like the light is really shining strongly.",
    "Maybe we can put up more green in the water.",
    "So before after, before after, it's really magic.",
    "Oh nice, Martin, that's awesome.",
    "Thanks, thanks for sharing that.",
    "That makes me happy.",
    "So I think what I'm going to do now is make a new layer and go to image apply image, so I'm at those phase where I kind of want everything to be merged and start doing finishing touches, but I don't really want to like get rid of everything else I've done below an like merge it all and lose it.",
    "So I'm just going to kind of group these and keep them just in case we will make it group so we look like we're organized and then we'll keep painting on top of this layer.",
    "So there's my.",
    "Little compromise.",
    "Color Dodge is really nice, but cannot get out of hand quickly.",
    "That is so true.",
    "Absolutely yeah, I feel that I have to stop myself from going overboard and sometimes they don't succeed.",
    "Sometimes I sometimes I go overboard.",
    "Do you wanna hi Mattie, do you use a hardcover film to protect your tablet?",
    "Thank you lot.",
    "You're amazing.",
    "Oh thank you.",
    "Thank you for the nice comments.",
    "I do not use any type of film on my tablet, but I think it depends on what kind of tablet you're using.",
    "If you want to use something like that.",
    "So for the Centriq, it's not really required like the tablet screen can hold up without getting scratches on it.",
    "With normal use like the Stylus is not going to scratch it.",
    "I haven't scratched it anyway yet.",
    "I haven't experienced it getting scratches, so it's pretty sturdy and doesn't have a problem with that, so I don't like to put anything on top of it because I prefer as little parallax as possible.",
    "So that means like this the as you put your stylus against the screen.",
    "There's that little bit of glass that makes it feel like you're not right on the paper, but there's that little space in between and that's gotten a lot better with the newer models and overtime it's just.",
    "Gotten better and better, but there is that little weirdness and I don't like to put any extra layers on there unless I absolutely have to.",
    "And so it doesn't really need the extra protection so I don't put it on, but some tablets might have a different a screen that's made out of something different, and maybe it would benefit you to have a protective layer on top.",
    "I'm not 100% sure.",
    "I've definitely heard people using things like that on their tablets, but.",
    "I don't think.",
    "For mine that I wouldn't bother with it.",
    "So if I turn this later on and off, you can see what I'm adding.",
    "I'm just going in with some different colors of green, some more vibrant ones, and just popping in little little pop so late in between in between here.",
    "Hungarian.",
    "I'm happy you're feeling inspired, but I'm sorry that you're having that experience.",
    "All I can tell you is I started doing these virtual Plein Air Studies about like it's at least a year and a half ago now an I made a lot of bad paintings like I promise you, especially at the beginning when I first started doing these because I used to paint primarily paint characters, and I've shown some of the early ones on my Twitch stream before.",
    "Just kind of reminiscing.",
    "And yeah, you just have to take my word for it.",
    "There was a lot of really rough.",
    "Change things at the beginning and even now like I have some days where things are just off and it's just not working for me.",
    "But overall it's it's yeah it's.",
    "It's gotten better, but.",
    "My point is, it takes a lot of practice with doing these and they do get it does get better.",
    "So if you feel like things aren't working just hang in there and anytime that you do want to go studies it's.",
    "It's adding to your visual library is adding to your experience, and as you go there's going to be less failures.",
    "An more fun at the beginning if you're trying something new, like if you are doing more landscape painting and you haven't or any little anything really, those it's really hard at first.",
    "I'm very lucky that I had my life stream community to hang out and encourage each other and people encourage me to keep going while I was feeling that way, you know?",
    "And I'm very thankful for that because.",
    "It's hard, it's hard to push through when you're having.",
    "Those days are just feeling like nothing is working.",
    "But I promise that anybody that's gotten good at painting landscapes or anything is definitely felt that way.",
    "It's like, Super Normal.",
    "This is so beautiful.",
    "Well then you love the idea of using Google images in Google Maps.",
    "Going to try this.",
    "Nice thanks Alice.",
    "Yeah, it's really really fun and you can if you do share your work, use the hashtag virtual plein air, and then people can.",
    "You can see if they're looking for that, take about it.",
    "Hi Andy logo.",
    "Hope you're doing well.",
    "I think I'm going to add a couple more little branches.",
    "I kept the branches really come to a minimum in my painting, but I don't know.",
    "I feel like we're missing something.",
    "So in the in the reference, there's a.",
    "Random little branches coming down like this.",
    "I think I'm going to try to add them.",
    "Sorry for the background noise by the way.",
    "My boyfriend's working from home now like a lot of us.",
    "So there's little background noise.",
    "Do you have Instagram?",
    "I do it should be the link should be in the description below the stream video.",
    "And if you can't find it, let me know.",
    "I'll post it in the chat.",
    "Maybe you could do movies, TV show stills as well.",
    "Yeah, I've thought about that so many times and.",
    "Rarely done it, but it's a really good idea.",
    "What I have done is a bunch of video game Screenshots, which probably isn't as beneficial, but is also fun and fun is important.",
    "I'm an architect and do a lot of architectural visualization sketches, but it's hard to switch my style.",
    "Oh, that's awesome.",
    "That's awesome.",
    "Must be cool to design things that actually get get built.",
    "But yeah, I can imagine that you're used to a pretty precise way of working.",
    "Yeah, thanks for asking Alex.",
    "Just adding little highlight to the branch here.",
    "Yeah, I think I like that.",
    "I think I like that he had a couple more.",
    "I'm going to get carried away.",
    "Yeah, that's nice.",
    "Let's try let's try a couple more.",
    "It's at least one more, and then we'll add some leaves and then we should be good.",
    "It's nice these branches bringing RI back into the scene.",
    "There's also branches coming in from the side over here, so we can take a look at that.",
    "Do it on its own layer, just in case.",
    "Just in case.",
    "We don't like it.",
    "So here's an example of something that I really like in paintings when it happens so.",
    "Having to do with the values, if we turn this into black-and-white, this is this.",
    "Green mossy area is lighter than the branch coming out, but the branch comes out into the light at a perfect time.",
    "Where the background here is in shadow.",
    "Technically, in the reference, this wasn't happening in such a dramatic fashion, but I tried to exaggerate it because I love when this happens and it makes it much easier for the viewer to see what's going on.",
    "Because you get that contrast, it's popping either way, so this is a popular thing.",
    "In portrait painting, you know to have, like.",
    "The background is dark over here and then the person's face is light and then as it shifts, its the opposite on the other side.",
    "So you can see what's going on even though we have that shift.",
    "So up over here, we want to bring these.",
    "Yeah, that's definitely going to help.",
    "There's all these mossy.",
    "Branches there really green.",
    "I don't think I got the right color yet, but this is the idea.",
    "They're going to come down from over here.",
    "Yeah, that would be nice.",
    "What kind of do our own thing?",
    "They don't have to be exactly like the reference, but it's working, so maybe just the stick pretty close to what is there.",
    "The colors are so good.",
    "Thank you.",
    "These colors make me happy.",
    "It's like my favorite.",
    "The Bright, Bright Green's a little bit of warm light.",
    "I love I love these kind of.",
    "Scenarios.",
    "Alright, I think it's a little weird how these are all stopping right here, so we're going to do the same thing.",
    "We're going to have them come out in front here and.",
    "Be a little bit darker.",
    "So we can see them.",
    "Something like that.",
    "And maybe another one.",
    "Is also going to reach out?",
    "Or maybe this one will have another little branch come off of it.",
    "Something like that.",
    "Maybe it's too small.",
    "I can barely see it.",
    "We need leaves.",
    "I think.",
    "Let's add some leaves on this one.",
    "Liquor selection Cute little leaves.",
    "It looks kind of funny.",
    "All thanks, thank you James.",
    "I'm glad you think so.",
    "And look at the upper area with the rocks cleans.",
    "It reads better than the reference.",
    "Thank you.",
    "I've been trying to get better at like simplifying the references a little bit, especially ones like this.",
    "They're kind of overwhelming with a lot of detail, so I'm glad you like that choice.",
    "It's.",
    "Something I've been working on and it's like a little hit or miss when I make the right choices with that stuff.",
    "I want to get some more of these leaves with a little bit of bounce light shine that blue that adds a lot of depth to foliage I think.",
    "Alright, now I'm going to zoom in on the branches over here on the left a little bit because I think they're a little flat.",
    "what I have going on here?",
    "I'm going to lock the layer, let's color pic from it and choose a little bit of a darker color and give like a tiny bit of a shadow to the branches on the underside.",
    "Feel like their little flat with just the one color and their little close to the viewer to have such little detail.",
    "So even just a little bit something.",
    "And we'll add some more leaves over here.",
    "I'm just looking at the reference and there's some little little leaves up and out, and having that shine on there, it's just.",
    "Good addition, we got going on.",
    "Could you grab the airbrush or any softer brush?",
    "Something like this up like this up a little bit.",
    "Maybe we'll put that layer underneath the branch.",
    "I do want some leaves there, but I don't know if I like that.",
    "A lot of trial and error.",
    "OK.",
    "So.",
    "Let's Merge this stuff.",
    "And I think we're kind of at the point where we're going to put some finishing finishing touches here.",
    "What I tend to do sometimes is after after stream I'll kind of put down a painting for a little bit and then, like a day later, so I'll take another look at it and see if I get any ideas.",
    "It's a really nice luxury if you have an artwork you're working on where you don't have to immediately post it or publish it or send it in.",
    "Sometimes you have deadlines and that's how it is.",
    "You have a deadline, but if you don't it's nice to have a couple like a day or.",
    "In a couple of days to think about your leave your art alone and then look at it again.",
    "And a lot of times you'll come up with some different ideas of things to change or ad.",
    "I feel like I've significantly improved paintings in the past by waiting a little bit longer before posting them, and then suddenly like a big mistake is visible to me.",
    "Or, you know, just something that could be improved a lot, and when you're looking at something for a long time, sometimes you become blind to those little things, so some other reason it's good to ask for.",
    "Second opinion if you have artist, friends and things like that.",
    "If any of you guys are looking for.",
    "That kind of.",
    "Feedback on your work.",
    "You're welcome to join my discord.",
    "There's like a share your art section, and there's a place to share your art.",
    "And there's a place to ask for critique.",
    "So if you want to share your art without.",
    "Asking for critique that still fine, but there's critique section if you want.",
    "And anyway, yeah, that can also help get a another look at it for exercise, but for me a lot of times I just like to give myself a little break between posting.",
    "And yeah, I don't know if you guys have ever had this, but for some reason it seems like the second you post something that's when you notice the thing that's wrong with it.",
    "Like instantly after being posted like oh, why did I post it so quick, so yeah.",
    "Long story short, I will probably after the stream I will probably take a break from this painting.",
    "Maybe come back to it.",
    "Tomorrow or so and then see if it's really done, and then that'll be it.",
    "Share it.",
    "I'll probably post this one here on be hands 'cause I like how it's coming out.",
    "Thank you, great depth in your pic.",
    "Thank you Robert.",
    "I really love these kind of lighting scenarios because there's a lot of opportunity to show depth.",
    "I think it's.",
    "More so than.",
    "Some areas that don't have as dramatic lighting, so I'd look painting dramatic lighting.",
    "This.",
    "I'm gonna go one more time over it with the splash brush.",
    "By the way, if anybody was painting along and you want to share.",
    "I will probably be finishing up kind of soon, so if you'd like me to be able to look at and show your artwork on the screen.",
    "Think about maybe uploading it soon, no rush if you're not ready, you can always still just post it later in my discord.",
    "If you'd like to share it there or during the feature stream.",
    "The way to rush through your work, but I just wanted to give a heads up.",
    "Alright, so we got some little splashes.",
    "OK like that, duplicate the layer if we want to make it a little bit more intense, but I don't think so.",
    "I think it's fine.",
    "Work a little bit more in the waterfall.",
    "We're done.",
    "I think I should pay more waterfalls like I love these types of scenes, but I found the waterfall, the actual waterfall.",
    "You know, the water really difficult to paint, so that means we should probably paint more of these.",
    "I don't think I would mind too much, but I need to practice.",
    "I paint a lot of waterfalls, scenes or I have painted a lot of waterfall scenes from further away, and that's very different because the the water just kind of becomes one big stream.",
    "That's like a lot easier to Stylize.",
    "But this one was like.",
    "Much more difficult bobbies.",
    "Things happening.",
    "Thank you auntie pixel.",
    "Thanks very much.",
    "Painting along rushing again.",
    "Oh, clever, don't don't rush too much.",
    "You're always welcome to share it later.",
    "I don't want to ruin your painting experience here.",
    "My take might finish it another day.",
    "Alright, so we've got so far from Jackson Joker.",
    "I love how your water came out.",
    "What do you think about it?",
    "I hope you like it.",
    "Captures a feeling of motion.",
    "It really feels like it's moving and flowing down and this area down here.",
    "I'm gonna think I'm gonna take some hints from what you did.",
    "Look at this look at this area.",
    "This shift from.",
    "Teal green gold warm olivey green.",
    "That's really pretty.",
    "I think this is working too.",
    "Yeah, that's awesome, beautiful.",
    "Beautiful.",
    "Oh my gosh, I love it.",
    "Thank you for painting with me.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Thanks everyone who's painting along.",
    "I'll share my study in the discord later.",
    "Still not really far with it.",
    "Oh, I totally get it.",
    "No worries.",
    "Like I said, I probably will.",
    "I might spend a little bit more time on this too on another day before I finally call it done, but I think I think it's not a good place for now for me.",
    "Larious isn't really new with digital painting.",
    "It's also encouraging hearing your story.",
    "I wish I could remember to know each time you drop a helpful trick all like the lasso thing.",
    "Well, thank you if you find it helpful to watch again later.",
    "I don't know if it's too long for something like that, but my video any of my past stream videos are available on my page.",
    "If you go to my profile here on the hands and click the videos tab there all there and there's actually something really nice that be hands has the.",
    "It's called a tool timeline and it's not visible when I'm live, but if you watch any of my past videos, it's recording as I stream.",
    "It's recording the tools that I'm using an like the brushes and colors that I'm picking and everything, and it will show that during the playback.",
    "So if you if I'm going too fast for anything then you will be able to see it in the tool timeline.",
    "It's super cool, you check it out and all the streams are recorded there.",
    "Bottom half I'm happy with top half not so much.",
    "Yeah, it's I.",
    "I feel like that in a sense like for me I feel like this area is.",
    "It's like.",
    "I don't know.",
    "I feel like it's maybe not quite done, but I'm not sure why.",
    "I don't know yet.",
    "I'm going to like sit on it a little bit will be a little bit, but I'll show you guys what we did today for anybody who came in during the latter part of stream.",
    "This was the first painting of the day.",
    "Different mood, but still beautiful lighting, right?",
    "That's like what inspires me.",
    "That's what makes me want to paint something is when I see lighting.",
    "Whether it's beautiful daytime scene with dappled lighting, or like sunset or sunrise, these type of lighting situations.",
    "Are my favorite thing, so this was the first painting and this is the second one.",
    "They're both photo studies.",
    "You can find the reference images below.",
