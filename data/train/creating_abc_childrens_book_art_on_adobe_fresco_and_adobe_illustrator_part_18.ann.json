    "Yep, there, we go.",
    "Delete that.",

    "May I guess I could do that.",
    "Sorry.",
    "I'm sorry illustrator purists.",
    "I do what I need to do to get the job done.",

    "Drawl about the pencil Dan.",
    "And that's how I am when I teach then of course I will use the pencil.",
    "Then it's probably going to be a better option since uh.",
    "It's faster.",
    "I mean as many clicks in click, and drag them that I'm doing right now, I probably would be done.",
    "If I was doing it with a pencil.",
    "How many clicks and drags do you need to make the letter A?",
    "And I'll tell you what once I get the print version of this book.",
    "I'm gonna look at it and be like man?",
    "What was I thinking?",
