    "Jordans got this sci-fi character that she's been working on which is coming out real cool.",
    "Real quick, I'm going to run you through my references.",
    "What I'm looking for in each of them and how we're going to approach doing this.",
    "Looking at the this initial fireplace, I really like the stone detail here.",
    "I don't want anything too crazy, so as opposed to keeping the top stone as well, we're actually going to go instead for a big piece of.",
    "Would.",
    "I forget the name for this kind of wood.",
    "Right, you know?",
    "Am I doing?",
    "I'm doing alright, I gotta.",

    "By the way, this is dried Moss.",
    "I needed it for reference for something, I promise.",
    "Little bit of a block today, but hopefully work through that off stream actually worked on some materials and alchemists.",
    "I got the The Hearthwood done here.",
    "How much we're going to use as a cross beam of the top?",
    "That's alright.",
    "He's little work.",
    "Come also got a bark done for our actual fire firewood here.",
    "Got a bit of A.",
    "There's other materials go just a quick stone.",
    "I think.",
    "I'll leave a simple something like this.",
    "I'd love to work on that on stream and show you guys that, but for whatever reason, every time I work in that program while I'm streaming my microphone quality just goes out the window.",
    "Yeah, trying to keep the.",
    "Trying to keep these manageable.",
    "You kind of.",
    "You quickly realize just how short a week is.",
    "Once you start doing these weekly challenges so I gotta workout.",
    "Something a little quick, then.",
    "A little bit of blocking out here.",
    "We got the.",
    "In column pillars they aren't done yet.",
    "I just wanted to get their basic shape in just to see how they look.",
    "I want to have all sorts of.",
    "Details, Little Kinks and chips if I can.",
    "And then we kind of certain blackout that.",
    "The bigger part with their.",
    "I think we're going to do.",
    "Now maybe just quickly.",
    "Block out the rest of the fireplace here.",
    "Just sort of basic size and shape and right now I'm not completely decided as to.",
    "How much of this I'm going to live up to the material.",
    "Think probably most of it, so we might honestly just keep a big.",
    "Big square here.",
    "How about we will do though is we're gonna go ahead and reverse our faces just so that box is facing it.",
    "Works like that.",
    "And honestly, that's not too bad.",
    "All right?",
    "Yeah, probably gonna be a little more laxer St.",
    "They will try to get enough work done though.",
    "Yeah, next I think I kind of just.",
    "Just to do something.",
    "Kind of quick and easy, and I think I'm going to workout just a piece of firewood.",
    "It's kind of getting ahead of myself.",
    "I've been jumping around with this all day, working, working on materials and modeling or should just do one and finish it, but.",
    "But I said a little bit out of it.",
    "My workflow might be a little funny.",
    "That you forgive me for that.",
    "We're not worried about sites right now, just.",
    "Sorry about that.",
    "I think we're going to do is we're just going to double this.",
    "Play extreme at.",
    "Chunks that might be a little bit too.",
    "2 uniform though.",
    "Let's go the route of cutting up a cylinder instead.",
    "Will make sure I get a.",
    "He had a vision here I still have.",
    "Perfect.",
    "Words what's up with them?",
    "Now what we can do is we can just go ahead and delete like 3 extra sections here.",
    "We got ourselves to start to a piece of wood.",
    "Looking good.",
    "Yeah I did that round clips.",
    "Now I'm sorry.",
    "Yeah, and perception.",
    "And.",
    "I'm thinking I'm thinking here.",
    "Red real quick.",
    "We're going to actually delete this.",
    "Just because I want to.",
    "It's just not gonna work, is it?",
    "Hold on, we're going to go all the way back, because cylinders cylinders be hard sometimes.",
    "Could be honest.",
    "We're going to do this at the front back.",
    "Yeah, we're going to go ahead and grab bar tops here and do it tonight like that.",
    "That would be bad.",
    "Nice.",

    "Just gonna use that as an excuse.",
    "Too hot speak.",
    "Going down here.",
    "And I think we decided.",
    "Two was decent amount there.",
    "She still the same.",
    "And rectory were five minutes ago, just great.",
    "Just this time with an extra cut.",
    "Let's have a little bit of fun with this.",
    "See I kinda want to lay it on its side.",
    "Like So should be alright.",
    "Let's see all right?",
    "Few things I'm kind of kind of had a little rich here.",

    "And.",
    "No, it's not that thick.",
    "I don't really think I want to.",
    "I don't think I want to make sure that we're going to try just to.",
    "Just to see.",
    "Like maybe just a little bit.",
    "You just a little bit.",
    "No, I don't think so.",
    "Maybe, maybe not along these faces, but on the sides here.",
    "Let me know you guys think it needs it.",
    "Like Do it.",
    "And we're going to leave the cut in there anyways.",
    "'cause that will just help us.",
    "Help us assigner materials when I get to that point that will make it a little bit easier for us, so we're going to do now is going to add just a whole bunch of cats.",

    "So we're going to sell that out and.",
    "Hey Sam, how's it going?",
    "And we're going to hit this with a lattice box.",
    "Would you do bro?",
    "Right now I am.",
    "What about 3D modeling for this weeks challenge on their hands?",
    "What does everyone do?",
    "Everyone say what you do be?",
    "Yeah, making little fireplace here and at the moment working on some logs.",
    "Speak in front.",
    "I shouldn't create this lattice blocks and this is just going to make it.",
    "Fair bit easier for us to manipulate the shape of this would here.",
    "So rather than moving around, the Verts are self, we can kind of move around this little control box and it will move everything inside just the way it needs to be so I can give it a little bit more of a natural look.",
    "It's Amy fast.",
    "Let us.",
    "That is not true.",
    "I am pretty slow when it comes to my work.",
    "I gotta be honest.",
    "Slow in there.",
    "And mostly abandoned is my motto.",
    "You should have them in order.",
    "That's gotta be more than half of project as I started I just do not finish.",
    "It's rough sometimes.",
    "We probably could have used an extra.",
    "Lattice point here.",
    "Just take a look at the.",
    "It's not fancy yet.",
    "I get it.",
    "Don't worry about it.",
    "This campaign is terrible.",
    "It's horrible.",
    "But right now I said, what if we did like a low Poly thing and I remember it?",
    "When materials are all hyper realistic so.",
    "I say hyper realistic.",
    "That's implying that they're good, but they're necessary, but just done in a realistic style.",
    "It should say, although we could.",
    "You know, now I'm playing with the idea of like a little low Poly fireplace, but.",
    "I don't know how much of that is me wanting to do something stylized versus me not wanting to make this little log look good, so.",
    "I don't know.",
    "We're going to do everything here, though I think we're going to.",
    "Make a few changes before we lattice this.",
    "Deleting everything manually like some sort of mad lad, let's just get rid of her box, get back to it was.",
    "To have should be.",
    "This part.",
    "Is Prince greatest problems?",
    "I gotta be honest.",
    "You like quads here.",
    "This is not a quad.",
    "I mean there tries.",
    "They aren't bad, but we're going to get a lot of pinching in this corner.",
    "The way it's set up correctly.",
    "That's not ideal.",
    "So we're going to try and solve this.",
    "These things are just kind of like a little puzzle.",
    "Figuring out here topography.",
    "I for one, have never been great at puzzles.",
    "I don't know the solution here.",
    "I gotta be honest.",
    "You see, there's like.",
    "To see how this is going to help, How do I?",
    "How do I do this?",
    "This is the solution.",
    "Have super water that will come to us then.",
    "Speak.",
    "OK, sit up straight.",
    "Yep.",
    "In about this we don't want.",
    "You can we already got.",
    "He got some problems.",
    "Big Brown Stew Kind of a flat top here.",
    "We don't want this.",
    "We have such a point, so I'm going to try.",
    "That we experimented in here, OK?",
    "The problem I have with a lot of.",
    "Tutorials or things?",
    "You might see you and watching like 3D modeling or I'm sure pretty much any discipline far it is.",
    "The people doing this tutorials typically have done the project they're doing before, and they're just going through it a second time with you.",
    "So you don't often get to see a lot of problem solving.",
    "It's obviously not always the case, but I feel like most of the time she watched these people under like instantly know exactly what function is to happen next, and they never hit CTRL Zeke so they know exactly what to do, and it's just it's not really like that.",
    "It's kind of.",
    "That was a misleading, but you can get the wrong impression.",
    "OK.",
    "Hemau how's it going?",
    "How you doing man?",
    "Thanks for stopping in.",
    "For now, we're going to go ahead and do a.",
    "But that is not available, actually poop.",
    "But now we got this big old and gone.",
    "So we're gonna do is we're actually delete every other.",
    "Set up, haven't even.",
    "It's not even.",
    "Sorry.",
    "We're going to do here.",
    "Skin ago appear.",
    "Don't find his head two burgers, cheddar Pickles and onions.",
    "Simple stuff right on.",
    "Oh man.",
    "Just saying that out loud I can.",
    "I can feel my arteries clogging up.",
    "Sounds good though.",
    "Sounds delicious.",
    "It's one of those words I can't say very well.",
    "I gotta be honest.",
    "I avoided delicious, delicious, delicious.",
    "Just can't do it.",
    "6 one.",
    "Delicious.",
    "Delicious.",
    "Getting that right, I don't know.",
    "Not convinced.",
    "Testing the ability, but I have to click.",
    "Week Deleted half of our loops here discusses.",
    "This topic would be way to dance to practically work with it.",
    "Still going to be pretty dense.",
    "It should be a little bit better.",
    "Fingers crossed.",
    "And all that to alleviate a little bit of pinching.",
    "Super 40 ones not like McDonald's or something selfie if it's good quality.",
    "There you go.",
    "Just moving to look for.",
    "Printing errors, which we seem to have a lot of.",
    "So having sex vertices we should be afraid though.",
    "Just gonna merge just in case we do fine.",
    "Let's add a support group here.",
    "He said it will be better than you.",
    "Refrigerate a strange accent sound like from Boston Bastet based teacher from basking.",
    "She had the strongest Bastin Hanks and it was I can't do it but.",
    "My goodness.",
    "Those mistakes extremely annoying, but I don't wanna be rude.",
    "Was probably just hurts to be honest.",
    "Yeah, that.",
    "And I know I said We were going to use.",
    "Atlantis, we still aren't just wanna make.",
    "Feel.",
    "I feel for what I want to do with this.",
    "To be so large.",
    "I still I don't know.",
    "I need your guys's vote.",
    "Part of me feels like the bark part of this.",
    "Like a dog bark, but you know would work needs to be slightly shoot it I guess.",
    "Let's look at our.",
    "It's almost like there's a gap going on if we tried that instead, 'cause it's not sticking out any further, is it?",
    "It's just.",
    "And it might separate fine when we get the material on, but I just feel like there needs to be something sets it apart from.",
    "The rest of the model here.",
    "It's true that part.",
    "It might have a decaf with cream to push the bridge there.",
    "Proficiency Test told you.",
    "Mixed accent.",
    "Don't know, don't care, that's the spear tag What if instead of meddling we heard about Nick Stern and we do?",

    "So it feels like it's kind of extruded.",
    "And it's just so uniform.",
    "Sorted out Thank you.",
    "I hate this song.",
    "This is so repetitive.",
    "I gotta get some new Neptune today.",
    "Extrude and add termites.",
    "God support would.",
    "I really want to show you the materials we have for this, but.",
    "You know?",
    "When will you guys be able to hear me so I can't use the software?",
    "No.",
    "And if we do one of these instead already screwed up daily.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Turn it off, said he did little translate.",
    "See the problem is I'm going into this with the mindset of.",
    "Into a lot of hard surface modeling and.",
    "Things that would be machine made if they're real.",
    "So they're all very uniform, which is not foul.",
    "Thanks be in nature, so we're going to have to do our best to.",
    "Sort that out.",
    "I think we're on to something here though to be honest.",
    "Got high hopes.",
    "To find our function.",
    "No no no.",
    "Show me this year.",
    "Script run doing it the nearest want.",
    "I just wanted to push it in a little bit more.",
    "How do you stuff is going on today?",
    "Don't show the textures yet.",
    "I'm avoiding it.",
    "best I can, but as much as I want to because there's a lot of fun and I want to do more of it, but.",
    "You know or something up?",
    "Search Internet one day.",
    "Sure, I don't everyone what we got already.",
    "Alright, you know what?",
    "I think this is the way to go.",
    "So it looks like Greek to me, but I dig it.",
    "That's a nice thing if you ever if you ever get into 3D modeling and someone like walks by like man.",
    "I need to impress some people.",
    "It's so easy 'cause all you have to do is.",
    "She to find out what happened to your model.",
    "There you go, you just press a button and go into wireframe mode and they're like, Oh, fancy.",
    "Just take it to the people going I guess.",
    "We see that wire frame just.",
    "Mr.",
    "Crazy.",
    "Excellent naming scheme here.",
    "From the groups I got the fireplace and then the not fireplace.",
    "So we got, you know, if we got a decent decent start for what is a piece of wood.",
    "I think we can make this work.",
    "Is me basically saying I think it's time to.",
    "Kind of the lattice hacker mode engaged exactly.",
    "It's like goes to go straight to like 80s.",
    "Terrible 80s movie really thought of.",
    "Show me cheap wire frame early 3D models with a substitute for good special effects.",
    "I say he's probably like early 90s.",
    "Cough cough lawnmower man cough cough.",
    "See.",
    "Hi.",
    "That wire frame, though I gotta see how Mika, a good model and it's.",
    "Things mindlessly.",
    "Right, so I'm procrastinating.",
    "Is going to save before you forget that.",
    "Social learning.",
    "We go back.",
    "The form of the lattice.",
    "Mr.",
    "Their decision seriously have few more things.",
    "Are you?",
    "You don't want too many, otherwise it's just.",
    "It's too many it do anything.",
    "That wire frame I'm swooning.",
    "Who are law so fancy?",
    "I'll see here.",
    "We go to lattice points.",
    "Now we can clean it.",
    "Hennessy, we're looking at this piece of wood shake here, which is a nice piece of wood.",
    "Let's get to it.",
    "I'm going to kind of match that.",
    "I'm going to temper some expectations right now.",
    "This isn't going to look fantastic.",
    "We're not going to go in and sculpt all the beautiful.",
    "Chip detail and all that.",
    "We just kinda weak.",
    "OK gotta go quick, we gotta we can I top of that time.",
    "Add a little bit of artist block so.",
    "We're going to do.",
    "We can do.",
    "Looking at this, actually I'm going to want a few more.",
    "Divisions of whatever the hell this axis is going to be.",
    "Which we need to explore resizing every tweet.",
    "So excited.",
    "You Thank you.",
    "Last week she look.",
    "That many alright.",
    "Nice piece of what shape to it?",
    "Well.",
    "He talking about.",
    "It's a great piece of would like it kind of like lives to the little bit good form.",
    "Print color as well.",
    "I'm going to leave it there pretty challenge.",
    "My immature just good stuff.",
    "I think it would probably take you on.",
    "Actually grab.",
    "Press.",
    "This might be too much work with here.",
    "So so it doesn't help them stop kind of sitting funny.",
    "I'd rather the well.",
    "Spend.",
    "It's kind of sort this out.",
    "You don't need to be like we're not looking for.",
    "Precision or anything?",
    "Here we're just trying to give it a little bit more of an organic looks so.",
    "You don't have to match it perfectly.",
    "Just want to give it a little bit of noise.",
    "Now, if you.",
    "Just doing this project for realsies like for real for real.",
    "Turn on, probably take it into a little bit of sculpting like I'm just thinking how easy or be in Z brush just to.",
    "You don't look that damn standard, you know.",
    "Keep it nice.",
    "Flat edges here and there.",
    "Come to myself, trying not to.",
    "Hey this thing how you doing?",
    "We know that mind the final render.",
    "It's not.",
    "It's not the prettiest thing, but it was fun to have this in tabletop simulator and two.",
    "Tell my friends playing on something I made that there's a lot of really cool fun stuff.",
    "Yeah, I understood elders people right there.",
    "Now these things to the workshop, though it's something I haven't done.",
    "Not here to Maggie Condition Atkins all night.",
    "Appreciate the table.",
    "Thank you very much.",
    "Yeah, I gotta, I'll send you over the.",
    "This little figurine set date for Grand Haven if you're interested.",
    "Pretty happy with how it turned out.",
    "I wanna friend.",
    "I want to flatter top here.",
    "I gotta be honest.",
    "One day when I return.",
    "Are too many hobbies as is just so many things to learn.",
    "And so many other things that are equally fun without needing to learn anything.",
    "It can hear video games.",
    "All right, we're going to, yeah, we're going to do that thing we love doing, which is deleting all the work we've done and going back.",
    "You want a flat top we want.",
    "This is still too much of a point, I think.",
    "So what we're gonna do this?",
    "I think delete this whole upper rail.",
    "So.",
    "Take.",
    "Used parts in stock room.",
    "The same menu conference function said This guy that just changed up where he learned every two years and now he's a message this.",

    "Moving a dozen like some.",
    "It's crazy.",
    "I can't even do one thing well.",
    "I don't know.",
    "Why you do that?",
    "Just in a lot of time here, filling this whole again.",
    "So we can add it.",
    "What if I wanted to flatter?",
    "I don't want to.",
    "Do all that again so.",
    "Just gonna do it up beautiful.",
    "Every now and then it does what you want to do is just.",
    "You never expected.",
    "Got a little too further.",
    "Pre she can pick up the bio it might cause like viral at the time.",
    "It's unbelievable.",
    "You're happy with that sounds crazy.",
    "I have my coffee.",
    "I could pass that.",
    "I'm not saying that I'm saying.",

    "So I was like reading like short paragraph there and he's already like Oh my God, this overwhelmed.",
    "And then we got a little bit more to work with here.",
    "Go ahead and flying out of the little bit better though.",
    "Sounds like a Nicolas Cage 90s character like a macho myth Yeah, he was in face off with me.",
    "You know, good old Jason Randall.",
    "The judge fault will ever face off movie.",
    "No, it's kind.",

    "For dumb premise that they switch faces through some mishap or they're trying to disguise, it's just.",
    "So incredibly stupid was so much fun.",
    "Feeling sad, face laughing, you're missing out.",
    "I see that, but it has been.",
    "Probably not far off from a decade since I've seen it, so take it with a grain of salt.",
    "Man is this pinching dinner.",
    "Just be the death of me.",
    "Last one of our supporting edges.",
    "There we go.",
    "So much great.",
    "'cause look at this, they are not in line.",
    "Get my boys.",
    "This account 50 area.",
    "Everything's at a funny angle, which isn't ideal.",
    "Make it work.",
    "No, no, no face off.",
    "It's like you said if you don't know that class and get out.",
    "He should have to explain it.",
    "Yeah, face looks a little self explanatory.",
    "Um?",
    "Labeling field enough alone, nothing can stop talking time.",
    "The challenge?",
    "Are the glorious cage Trinity faceoff con air in the rock?",
    "It shouldn't have pinching on the side.",
    "Right now, maybe we're OK to go back and.",
    "Set up our lattice.",
    "What if we did one of these things?",
    "Gladys would give it 1 not.",
    "I've done it like 3 times.",
    "I'm hoping to have it.",
    "Will take the last separately out.",
