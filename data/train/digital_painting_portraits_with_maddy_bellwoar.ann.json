    "Hi everyone, good morning.",
    "Good afternoon good evening whatever time it is for you.",
    "Welcome and thanks for being here.",
    "I nagat ish high everybody.",
    "I hope you're having a good day so far we are going to be doing something a little bit different today.",
    "I usually do landscapes but I've had a bunch of requests lately about painting portraits and wondering if we're going to do some portrait studies together since we do a lot of landscapes.",
    "Might be nice to mix it up.",
    "So I thought we would do that today.",
    "Get back in the groove a little bit with painting people so high red.",
    "I picked a couple of images and I thought we could do some studies of these and it's been a little while since I've done portraits, so I'm not 100% sure as far as like estimating how long it will take, but I would like to do a couple paintings today so it would be nice to keep.",
    "Each one around the two 2 and half hour mark.",
    "But it's a little harder for me to estimate, so we'll see how it goes and see if it needs more time.",
    "But I was thinking we could do a couple portraits.",
    "Hi Stephanie.",
    "Hi Steve and Joanna.",
    "Hi everyone so this is the first one.",
    "If you look in the.",
    "The description stream description you can find the link to the photographers post for this image.",
    "And.",
    "I'm going to put this on my other monitor next to the chat.",
    "Next to you guys.",
    "And then will start on a fresh clean sheet.",
    "I'm using pure ref to have this little thumbnail view up here, 'cause I find it handy.",
    "And that you can find a link to pure ref below in the stream description also.",
    "Hi Sean, good to see you all if anybody.",
    "If you guys like the reference picture that I chose, I think it's a beautiful photo is from Unsplash.",
    "If you like it and you want to paint with me, you're welcome to join in.",
    "Or you can just hang out and watch whatever you like.",
    "High foster thanks.",
    "Thank you.",
    "How a drill?",
    "Excuse me guys, having like a little bit of allergies and stuff today, so it's just going on this time of year.",
    "So I apologize, my voice is like little weird.",
    "OK, so there's one more thing I wanted to show you before we start painting, and that is there's a.",
    "There's another link I added to my stream description just for today.",
    "Since we're doing portraits, I find this really helpful in painting portraits.",
    "I wanted to share it with you.",
    "You guys might be familiar with this already.",
    "But this is a photo of John SRO's planes of the head bust statue.",
    "This you can find a link below in the stream description.",
    "I'll post in the chat also and this is where you can download some photos of this.",
    "They're really nice to study from and look at when it comes to painting.",
    "Portraits an understanding where the different curves are on the face and stuff like that.",
    "Looking forward to it.",
    "I avoid painting people.",
    "I hope I hope it'll help with something.",
    "Stephanie I'm I understand I was funny like I used to be more into painting characters in people and then I got obsessed with landscapes and now it's been awhile.",
    "So I have a little bit of that feeling like.",
    "It feels a bit rusty, so I'm hoping I can like get back into it and then maybe I'll feel more comfortable jumping around between them.",
    "Right now.",
    "I'm definitely feeling a little apprehensive about it.",
    "Hey Alexandra, well let's get started and I will be explaining my process as we go through here.",
    "And if you have any questions let me know as always, but looking at the time I'm planning, I'm going to attempt about two 2 1/2 hours on this portrait and we'll see where we are from there and then we'll kind of assess if we need more time or not, but.",
    "I'm going to be sketching first because I find it a bit easier to do.",
    "It's not like it's more of a personal preference workflow thing.",
    "Some people like to sketch, and some people go right in and just start painting with.",
    "Blocking and colors and stuff.",
    "So I will put a Gray background here just so we don't have to look at the white.",
    "Bright screen so much.",
    "But other than that I got my sketch pencil.",
    "Let's get, let's get started.",
    "So Oh yeah, so I was showing the Plains of the head thing.",
    "what I am going to do with that, just in case you're curious, is I'm just going to add that.",
    "To my reference page here.",
    "Forgot to do that.",
    "That was way bigger than needed, but I'm just going to add this over here.",
    "So this is going to be.",
    "Well, I'm looking at on my other monitor.",
    "Hey Jackson, Good morning.",
    "I'm trying portrait today but.",
    "I'm.",
    "I'm looking forward to it.",
    "I'm just like, yeah, it's been awhile but.",
    "This is a beautiful portrait so.",
    "It's giving me some some inspiration.",
    "Alright, so I tend to start very almost like cartoony, this is this is true for landscapes.",
    "Two like my my early sketches are always very rough and then I have to kind of go over them.",
    "So that's what I'm going to do.",
    "Here is just just start somewhere we can refine it, specially digital.",
    "It's really nice so don't feel too.",
    "Worried about your early process being messy?",
    "That's always the case.",
    "So I'm mostly focused on her face.",
    "But it would be nice to get a little bit of upper body in.",
    "It's such a tall photo.",
    "But I guess I don't need to have all that space above her head in the compass in my my version.",
    "We don't really need all that.",
    "I think the hair is really well.",
    "I think it's really pretty the way that it's like falling around her shoulders and it becomes such a strong shape.",
    "So I feel like for someone who's into stylization, this hair shape has a lot of potential.",
    "The way that it's like grouping up and forms into a big curl like this.",
    "I think that's really cool.",
    "Cool shapes going on here.",
    "Feel like I need to.",
    "Bigger, smaller.",
    "I don't have enough room.",
    "Hey Claire Z portraits today.",
    "I'm excited, it's been too long, so my goal eventually you guys is to combine people and environments.",
    "I kind of went from first I was really the people, not really into environment, so it's like.",
    "I gotta get them go in at the same time at some point.",
    "Try doing some line art.",
    "Portrait ended ended up painting over it.",
    "Sometimes that's the way to go, like sometimes it's just not flowing like your lines are.",
    "Just don't feel like it's flowing that way and gotta shake up the.",
    "The Workflow present in different groups.",
    "I'm going to flip so portraits more than anything else.",
    "I feel like it's helpful to flip.",
    "Why is this not working?",
    "I'm trying to flip my little mini reference here, but.",
    "I must have messed up something with the shortcut.",
    "Oh well, I'm not going to flip the little mini reference.",
    "I hope you guys don't mind.",
    "I'll just keep going, but it's nice to flip your actual drawing, 'cause you'll start to notice things that are off with it when you flip it horizontally.",
    "If you get really desperate, you can flip it vertically too, but I don't usually do that.",
    "I have done it, but it's it's only in desperate circumstances.",
    "Usually flipping it horizontally is enough to.",
    "Get me to start visualizing things better.",
    "Uh, see, red says this is the last two portraits I did.",
    "Let me check this out.",
    "Ooh, this is cool.",
    "Check this out.",
    "I find it really hard to to do these like wild hair colors and make it look like a realistic or natural or something like that.",
    "Even though people people have leaves hair colors but doesn't really pretty gradient.",
    "Very nice job on the skin and the reflections.",
    "So you've been keeping up with you in portraits, red, that's good.",
    "That's good.",
    "I'm going to get back in the flow today.",
    "Hope all right.",
    "Well, I like to draw big hair, so it's possible that I made her hair bigger than needed, but.",
    "Who doesn't like to draw big hair?",
    "Alright, so let's work on the face.",
    "Alright, so I'm going to draw some guidelines for the eyes.",
    "Hi Elodie.",
    "I've no love.",
    "And mouth little guides.",
    "Now this sketch and all this stuff I'm doing right now.",
    "This kind of messy stuff.",
    "It's not going to be in the painting, it's just the guide Ann.",
    "I will be putting this at a low opacity when I paint same things I do with my landscape sketches and then as soon as possible, like as soon as the paint can painting kind of carry itself.",
    "Then I will erase or just like turn turn off the layer visibility or delete the layer you know get rid of it.",
    "So this is just kind of like a temporary temporary guide so I don't worry about it making it like very precise.",
    "It depends on your art style.",
    "Some people have line art in there finished finished artwork.",
    "They open lines.",
    "So in that case if I was going to do that kind of art style, I would probably go on top of this, like I'd lower the opacity of this layer and go on top of this rough stage and then do like a nicer like trace over this with a nicer line.",
    "Not super happy with those, but it's been awhile that I did portraits.",
    "That's what I was feeling to read like for today.",
    "I was like you know what I did last night.",
    "I I I started doing little sketching of that Sailor Moon.",
    "Redraw mean things going around.",
    "And that got me wanting to do portraits again.",
    "Just working on a character for a little bit, and I've had a lot of questions about doing portraits recently, so it's like, hey, why not?",
    "Yeah, I I didn't finish it.",
    "I don't know if I'm going through.",
    "I want to.",
    "I rarely take the time to do that kind of stuff.",
    "I feel like I've missed out on the last few like fun meme drawing memes that have gone around so but then there's a Sailor Moon one, and I'm like I really can't miss that on that.",
    "It's too much a part of my art history, like Sailor Moon is one of the things that got me into drawing in the 1st place as a kid, so I feel like I have to.",
    "I can't let that one pass by without even a little sketch, so.",
    "Alright, I have the tendency Speaking of Sailor Moon.",
    "I have the tendency, probably based on the fact that I used to draw anime characters.",
    "Tennessee to make eyes really big in my drawings disproportionately, so sometimes I have to revise that later on.",
    "I'm like aware that I do it, but I still managed to do it quite a bit so.",
    "Yeah, rub.",
    "Hi Andre, thank you.",
    "OK so just looking at my sketch, I think it's OK, but I'm missing a bit of her cool jawline.",
    "She is a very.",
    "She's a very strong bone structure.",
    "And.",
    "I want to accentuate that more.",
    "Yeah Jackson did you really?",
    "I'm impressed that you have impressed that.",
    "You guessed that one because honestly, I like.",
    "I said I've missed out on the last view.",
    "I didn't do the what was that again.",
    "The one where you did like half of your face, you took a photo and you drew on the other half.",
    "I can't remember what it was called, but that was going around.",
    "I've missed so many of these recent drawing.",
    "Things that went around the community, but this one I'm like no.",
    "I've got to do it.",
    "Right, everyone loves drawing those sparkly anime eyes for me it was Mila superstar.",
    "Yeah, it's something about the eyes, definitely.",
    "The eyes definitely.",
    "And like the crazy colors and this is fun.",
    "Fun overall.",
    "OK, well I don't.",
    "I'm not in love with the sketch, but you know we're not like I said We're not going to spend too long on the sketch 'cause we're going to figure stuff out in the painting, but this is more just so I have somewhere to start and is hopefully going to make the painting easier.",
    "So I'm going to put this on multiply mode and lower the Opacity.",
    "To like 1520%.",
    "Something like that.",
    "Will lock it so I don't accidentally paint on this layer and then we'll get started.",
    "Actually, before I before I lock, it was just in the right spot.",
    "I can move her over a little bit.",
    "There we go.",
    "Now we lock it.",
    "Usually end up making eyes bigger, just 'cause I prefer it.",
    "Yeah me too, and that's that's like what you can do in semi realism art style.",
    "You can do these things kind of differently.",
    "I just find that sometimes it gets to like an uncanny Valley thing and then I have to fix it.",
    "Then I've gone too far.",
    "But it depends on the style.",
    "You can pull off all kinds of crazy proportions in your work.",
    "Depending on how you do it.",
    "Yeah, it's fun to experiment with though.",
    "So for my portrait, if anybody is like painting along or you're interested in following along with like the tools that I'm using, the brush that I'm planning to use for probably most of this is that this brush here and you can download this brush for free if you want.",
    "It's in my free brushes pack that are it's linked right below the reference images in the stream description and this brush is called soft shading and blending and it's in that brush pack and it looks like this.",
    "And I really like this brush because it has it's kind of like an airbrush in the softness on one side, but it has one hard side so you can make a nice.",
    "Stroke that has a soft and hard edge and I really like it for painting portraits.",
    "This is like my go to brush for painting people, so if you're interested to check it out you can.",
    "All right, before we go on, I just notice I made her top of her head really big.",
    "OK, so.",
    "Lately I've been in my landscapes.",
    "I've been doing a lot of underpainting, so I wonder if I should do that here too.",
    "I don't know.",
    "It's interesting 'cause I've been practicing a lot with one particular subject matter landscapes.",
    "Now I'm doing portraits and I've learned a lot in the last few months with the landscape studies and I'm wondering how, if any of that is going to crossover and be helpful in portraits or not.",
    "So I started with this color from the for the background and the reason I chose it is because I think it will give a nice warm glow to the scene.",
    "And if you look at her skin there's this beautiful warm bounce light in a couple areas.",
    "I'm not exactly sure what the late.",
    "It may be from her skin and hair, but anyway, it's really pretty, so I picked that color for my background.",
    "For my underpainting And it's nice to get rid of the white background, because now I can add highlights that are lighter than this color.",
    "An shadows that are darker than this color, so it gives you more of the feeling that you're sculpting rather than just drawing and having to shade everything down from the pure white background.",
    "So I also want to on a new layer in between the background and the sketch.",
    "I think I'm going to start blocking some things in like the color behind her.",
    "She's in a room by the window and I wanted the reason I want to pay attention to this as I find it a lot easier to paint.",
    "The portrait, or you know, whatever I'm painting with a person or.",
    "Whatever is in the scene, if it's a still life, I find it easier to figure out the background first, like not in detail, but at least put something back there that shows what kind of lighting is going on, because that lighting is going to affect everything in the scene.",
    "So if you don't have anything going on the background if you're trying to paint a person with like nothing in the background is really hard because it's like what lighting circumstances this person in.",
    "Hi David, good to see you.",
    "I hope you're having a good day.",
    "Yeah, so we don't have to paint a detailed window over here.",
    "We can just pop in some colors.",
    "There's some Blues.",
    "You know it's blurred out anyway.",
    "The camera.",
    "Views is kind of it focused on her, not the window.",
    "Which is better?",
    "Alright, but a little something like this kind of abstract background that shows us some kind of the lighting situation.",
    "And I might just merge that down.",
    "And then make a new layer.",
    "So I do this a lot in my painting and it's just.",
    "It's just a workflow preference an you guys nobody has to do this, you know you're going to find out what works for you, but I tend to like to paint on a new layer like so.",
    "For example, I just made a new layer here.",
    "They're going to start painting her hair, so I'll sit here and start doing this.",
    "Start painting for awhile, usually a few steps.",
    "And it'll it'll sometimes it'll be for like 1520 minutes.",
    "You know, just just for awhile until you feel like you've done something that you like and want to.",
    "You know you're like OK, I'm sure that that part I want to keep that and then I'll go and merge it down and then I'll make a new layer.",
    "So it's like the layer that I'm working on.",
    "I still have flexibility of like do I make sure I like this or not?",
    "do I want to do anything with it before I make it part of my painting?",
    "But then I will eventually like merge it down to the painting so that's just like a little look at how I like to do this.",
    "It gives me a feeling of more of a feeling that it's like traditional painting an I'm painting more on one layer even though I'm not really.",
    "It gives me that mindset a little bit more rather than what I used to do is like I would keep the person.",
    "Separate from the background, and sometimes they keep their hair separate from them, and then I keep their clothes on another layer and that can work.",
    "If you want a very clean art style and it can work for anything.",
    "But if for me I've been going more for the look of like a traditional painting so it helps me to merge layers more often.",
    "It makes it look more paint hand painted it seems.",
    "Hello everyone from Estonia to all a good positive de Andre.",
    "Thank you so much.",
    "By the way, I think it's only it was really beautiful place.",
    "I've painted a few photos from places in Estonia.",
    "I really, really like the crazy green like amount of trees and plants and everything that is there in the summer.",
    "It's so pretty high, Jacqueline.",
    "Might learn a skill and thinking tap dancing.",
    "Having an OK day I would be off tomorrow.",
    "Wait are you serious?",
    "What that would be so cool?",
    "Why not?",
    "Why not?",
    "Actually learning some any kind of bad thing would be of probably be good right now.",
    "Get a little extra physical activity in.",
    "OK, so let's yeah.",
    "So right now what I'm trying to do is I have to save mindset.",
    "Here I'm trying to have the same mindset here as I often do in my landscapes and that is I don't want to go into detail in any one of these.",
    "The areas of the pacing, while other areas, have nothing going on at all yet, so I want to like move around the scene and just kind of start getting something there everywhere.",
    "So for example, she's wearing a black or very dark blue.",
    "I think black shirt.",
    "And.",
    "So we can get that blocked in.",
    "We got the background blocks in.",
    "We've got her blocked in.",
    "I'm going to work on her skin next, but I none of these areas look very good per se, but I just want to keep moving around until everything is at least in there and then we can go back and start painting nicely over the different areas.",
    "Hi Michael.",
    "Been playing around with that type of Workflow, merging it down when I'm happy it's helping me a lot be a lot more loose all clearly that's awesome.",
    "I'm very excited about that.",
    "I'm happy for you.",
    "I like how experimental, how willing to experiment you are being like early on in your learning process.",
    "It took me along time to get to that point, so I think that's really good for you.",
    "You don't think I could learn to tap dancer today?",
    "I hey if you could happen it could happen.",
    "If anyone could do it, you could do it.",
    "Alright, let's start working on the skin, so she's got a bright light.",
    "She's next to the window.",
    "Got a bright light hitting her arm.",
    "Sounds like a challenge.",
    "Emelina OK, So what color I feel like her skin is going to be really hard for me because there's so many different colors going on.",
    "Hi Tesla.",
    "Good to see you.",
    "I'm first going to just start blocking in colors like I just as if we're painting on traditional canvas and I'm just putting blobs of paint on here, like kind of remotely in the right place so that we can move him around later.",
    "Tesla says I zoomed into the subject size and I can see something on the other side of the window which is bright and bouncing lay under phase.",
    "So there seems to be from the window still direction cool.",
    "So if we get very if like enhanced consuming into the eyes.",
    "Yeah, I wonder what it is good detective work, Tesla.",
    "Yeah, but it's a really pretty bounce light, very.",
    "Glowy Alright, so.",
    "Let's keep going anyway.",
    "I really like this.",
    "This kind of brush because I can.",
    "I feel like I have a sort of sculpting kind of effect.",
    "I mean not, not so much yet, but we will get there.",
    "Well, I hope you guys are having a good day so far.",
    "For anyone who's just coming in, if you want to join me in painting this, you're welcome to an you can share whatever you do.",
    "If you want to no pressure, but you can always share what you do in the chat.",
    "If you're painting along and the reference images are just in the stream description below and also on the info tab above the chat, you can find them there too.",
    "So let's start darkening some of the facial features, so we have.",
    "A little bit of.",
    "More of an idea of what we're doing here so we can give her some eyebrows.",
    "Just a little bit of light bouncing off the nose here.",
    "So the reason I brought up the.",
    "Planes of the face earlier is to remind myself to think that way, and so I have to really make sure that I do it.",
    "But for example, if you think bigger about what's going on with the head and remember like this whole area here is like one big angle.",
    "And then over here.",
    "These are like big areas that have the same kind of lighting on them and not to get into too little little small details too fast so.",
    "Gotta remember.",
    "This stuff.",
    "And there's bounced lay on her face, and things like that.",
    "So we'll we'll get into a little detail things.",
    "But I have to remember not to do it too soon.",
    "And that's hard for me.",
    "I like details.",
    "So I'm staying zoomed out to where we can see her whole whole portrait, basically.",
    "And.",
    "I am trying to do that because I want it to read as a portrait.",
    "I don't want to.",
    "Get if I zoom in, I might make a really nice painting of an eye, but when I zoom out it might not fit in.",
    "With the rest of the painting either proportioning or proportionally or values wise like it might be just not fit in with the lighting.",
    "I notice that a lot when I used to zoom in and paint zoomed in and out of zoom out and I'd be like what?",
    "He looked so good when I was zoomed in, which happened, so I like to paint at this distance from my image for awhile and then when I find we need to do polishing stuff, then I'll finally like let myself zoom in.",
    "Robert says Hi, Mattie, the scripture in the UK today Oh man.",
    "It's it's pretty nice in the Netherlands, but it's definitely getting warmer.",
    "It's not a scorcher, but it's it's getting warmer.",
    "It's actually pretty nice here, although I'm inside, so the temperature isn't affecting the outside.",
    "Temperature is affecting me too much right now, but I'm hoping to go out later and take a take a nice walk.",
    "Maybe take some photos for painting if there's good son.",
    "But yeah, thanks for hanging out here.",
    "No time to paint, sorry.",
    "Been challenged the tab damn.",
    "But So I'm painting in her lips just basically as one big blob will get into the details of it later, but.",
    "Gotta start somewhere and let's get her eyes.",
    "Oh, you know what, let's do.",
    "With a lighter color 1st and then.",
    "So what I like to do with portraits that I don't do with landscapes sometimes is instead of getting rid of the.",
    "Start getting rid of the sketch by removing it from the painting.",
    "What I'll do is Alternatively just merge it into the painting and paint on top of it so it kind of disappears that way.",
    "So that is something we could do.",
    "'cause sometimes you can.",
    "Sometimes you're you need those little lines in the.",
    "In the sketch still, if I turn off the sketch.",
    "Yeah, we still need it.",
    "All right, so the chin is a very interesting and the nose.",
    "Last night was am bearable hot couldn't sleep, no.",
    "Oh Man, I had that a few times last summer.",
    "Actually quite a bit last somewhere.",
    "But it hasn't gotten quite that hot here yet.",
    "I'm actually looking.",
    "I'm actually like happy that it's getting warmer.",
    "We've only recently just started having nicer weather.",
    "At least to my tastes, to my standards I can.",
    "I enjoy pretty warm weather, I think.",
    "Alright, so I'm just flipping it horizontally to try to see some of my state mistakes and I definitely am seeing some what I'm going to do is duplicate my sketch layer just like and have this for reference.",
    "Maybe I'll need to bring it back in, but I want to merge my sketch onto the painting.",
    "So what I'm going to do is erase out any Wiley lines that are like not helpful.",
    "And leave the ones that I'm still using as a guide somehow.",
    "Like mostly it's the face so.",
    "Mostly it's the lines having to do with the face that are still useful.",
    "And I'll just merge that down.",
    "So.",
    "The nice thing about this is now if I want to edit something related to the face, I can.",
    "Have the whatever I do affect all of the line art, and I mean not line art, but the sketch and my painting when they were on separate layers, I couldn't use the transform tools and the same way and just kind of pull things around like this.",
    "So yeah.",
    "Here we are.",
    "Portrait painting can be a little bit rough because you know the early stages are going to be.",
    "Not so nice and you just gotta power through.",
    "Gotta power through the ugly phase as we call it.",
    "Until things start looking better.",
    "Take a look at the nose.",
    "Little light on one side, little shadow on the other side.",
    "Start having more 3D.",
    "I'm here.",
    "I also I do like to use.",
    "Layer blending modes.",
    "When painting portraits, I find them really handy and fast to use.",
    "So.",
    "I'm sure some examples mostly like multiply for shading is handy.",
    "Fix what I did here would be flipped.",
    "So yeah, we start with kind of a blob and then I'm trying to have the idea that I'm sculpting her.",
    "From that to make things more specific.",
    "I also like to use this much brush when I'm painting portraits to blur out if there's any hard edges that you feel like you don't really want or you want to last edge or something using this much brush there can be helpful.",
    "So let's make a new layer, put it on, multiply will grab the Airbrush.",
    "And I'm going to add some darker shadows, start getting some more crispness and hard edges.",
    "So I'm making a selection of the lasso tool and I'm going to grab a pretty dark color here.",
    "And just fill that in like the lasso tool is a stencil just blocking off where I don't want or where I do want the pain to go.",
    "So over here we could do the same thing.",
    "You can make a selection on the side of her face.",
    "So I'm trying to get that.",
    "Strong bone structure to stand out more.",
    "And then anywhere you want to soften that hard edge, you can just use the blurred smudge tool and where that out a little bit.",
    "So it's a nice modules are very nice way to accompany the lasso tool.",
    "An airbrush She want to soften those effects.",
    "And under the.",
    "The chin.",
    "So you can hold shift to add to your selection.",
    "An all to subtract from it.",
    "If you make a selection and you want to alter that bit.",
    "So I like the idea of using this warm colors underpainting, but I feel like I've never been able to get it back to a.",
    "Cool enough place.",
    "You still really really warm.",
    "I don't know if that's a bad thing.",
    "But just noticing it.",
    "So I merge that down 'cause I felt like it was kind of a checkpoint.",
    "I liked that layer that I did, so I'm going to make a new layer on multiply and keep going.",
    "Not done with that step.",
    "And I want to do some shading on her face while those intense.",
    "So that a little more chill.",
    "So.",
    "Just apply the eyes.",
    "She is wearing makeup and like a Smokey eye look.",
    "So that combined with the lighting.",
    "Definitely getting Smokey.",
    "Bye.",
    "Oh, thank you Elodie.",
    "So anyway that you want to block off, like for example we don't want shadow on her nose here, so you can just block that off and then use the airbrush you know.",
    "And you don't have to worry about it touching the area that you don't want that kind of thing.",
    "You can also hide the selection if you find that it's confusing.",
    "Once you made the selection, those little dots, you can control H and then that will disappear.",
    "I kind of got used to it.",
    "I mean, I don't really mind it, but you can hide it if it's really annoying.",
    "Like for example if I press CTRL age, it's still there.",
    "I can still do this, it is easier to see what you're doing.",
    "OK, so once if I have another tip I have for painting portraits is the turn your painting into black-and-white.",
    "Every so often an if you're painting from a reference, turn your reference into black-and-white too, because that's going to help you see where things need improvement, where your values, the darks and lights need help.",
    "So if I'm going to compare, you'll see that.",
    "As usual, my painting is starting off less contrast.",
    "I do tend to like build up contrast as I go, and that's really clear here.",
    "I need to add more highlights and more darks so.",
    "Yeah, but it's good to check up on that, especially if you're feeling like in areas sort of tripping you up a bit.",
    "So I need more shadows on the left side of her face.",
    "Yeah.",
    "And to turn your painting in a black and white, you can set that up as a shortcut and I'll show that really quick.",
    "So you guys might know this already, but just in case it's new to you is really handy.",
    "So I'm just going to show it.",
    "So you only have to set this up once and then it will always be there for you and you can go to view.",
    "Proof set up.",
    "Custom.",
    "And then when this pop up appears, you can just under the device to simulate under proof conditions, just select working grade game 20% from the drop down.",
    "And press OK and then after you do that, anytime you press CTRL Y, it's going to turn your painting into black and white and it's very nice because you can actually paint in this.",
    "Like Situation, I don't know.",
    "You can paint in linear when you have this setting activated so you can color pic and paint and whenever you turn it back to color you whatever called real colors the painting has.",
    "That's the colors that you're going to be painting with even though you're looking at it in black and white.",
    "So if you ever like really stuck on something in a painting, you can do that.",
    "I've done it an yeah just paint for awhile in the black and white view.",
    "I find this so helpful that I usually don't do.",
    "Black and white to color painting.",
    "A lot of people, a lot of artists use that Workflow, and there's something wrong with it.",
    "There's nothing wrong with it, but.",
    "Is actually used by a lot of professionals, but for me I like painting in color and I feel like the turning it being able to turn it into black-and-white like solves a lot of the problems for me that I would otherwise need to use a black and white to color workflow for.",
    "So I feel like I can paint in color.",
    "I just need to turn it into black-and-white every so often.",
    "Portrait 2 hours earrings, powers.",
    "That's no joke like those earrings are intense.",
    "I might like leave them out or just simplify them.",
    "Maybe will give her a little bit of a different style hearing like holy cow.",
    "Those earrings are crazy.",
    "They look cool though.",
    "She's definitely rocking them.",
    "Stephanie says in just in case you can open the same window twice in photo shop and play some side-by-side.",
    "Having the color proofing in one so you see in real time that is super cool.",
    "That's a good tip.",
    "So Stephanie, if anybody wants to do what Stephane is saying.",
    "Let's see where is that again?",
    "See if I can find it if you.",
    "I'm trying to remember 'cause I had to be honest, I never.",
    "I rarely do this.",
    "It's on one of these these to open a new version of your.",
    "Here file.",
    "Is it window?",
    "Yeah, yeah yeah, it's under window OK.",
    "There we go yeah window.",
    "Arrange a new window for whatever The thing is.",
    "And then you can have it open twice and I forgot where it was.",
    "So usually I use the Navigator window to have a separate thing open.",
    "So that's what I do for that.",
    "But you can't do the black and white thing like Stephanie was saying with the Navigator window, so that's a cool thing you could have this open.",
    "And I could be painting over here and looking.",
    "I've actually never tried it like I've never.",
    "Never done this.",
    "Play Makaveli.",
    "Good to see you.",
    "Thank you Stephanie.",
    "Yeah, you were right.",
    "I because of the delay in the stream.",
    "Um?",
    "I wasn't able to get your suggestion in real time unfortunately, but thanks guys.",
    "I found that eventually.",
    "Thanks David.",
    "Yeah, that's pretty cool.",
    "I wonder if I should.",
    "Well, I guess it doesn't hurt anything to have it open.",
    "I'm not using this space over here anyway at the moment, so I'll leave it open for a little bit.",
    "Thanks, Foster and thanks, Chad.",
    "Thank you for the tips, I appreciate it.",
    "I've actually learned a lot of handy photo shop.",
    "Things from from you guys in your suggestions.",
    "Lots of little things that are.",
    "Helpful.",
    "Like the the control Y, that's something that.",
    "Someone shared with me.",
    "Well, back what I was doing before is I was making a new window, filling it with black paint bucket and then putting it on color mode, which you can do that will also.",
    "Work the same basically, but then you can't color pic and paint and it's also just nice to have that as a shortcut you can press with one.",
    "Quick stroke at one quick keystroke.",
    "Hey Mancia How are you?",
    "I'm going to add to her now.",
    "It's kind of funny to see like a second painting going at the same time.",
    "So she's got a bright light on the ends and there a little bit later so we can happen.",
    "Nice little gradient.",
    "I'm going to let the painting be pretty loose around the edges.",
    "Not so concerned with the just, I'm just mainly my concern is painting the face and then it can kind of fade out.",
    "Outside of the that focal area, if you want to get this bright light on the shoulder though, I think that's important in explaining the lighting situation here.",
    "You can bring a little bit of that color upon through the skin.",
    "Here.",
    "Is the nose needs a little bit of love?",
    "We actually did knows studies recently in the art club, so if anybody doesn't know, art club is like an ongoing study group on in my discord server and were studying different topics every couple weeks.",
    "And lately we have been doing some studies on different facial features and features on the head ringing ears right now.",
    "And.",
    "We recently did noses so I have no excuse to cop out on this nose.",
    "Oh nice, well I'm glad you're here today then Mencia.",
    "It's true that I don't paint people down much anymore but I'm hoping to get back in the groove a little bit.",
    "I mean landscapes are my main interests and my main subject, but I do like painting people to an eye for myself.",
    "I do think it's important to, like not get to recipe on that.",
    "I want to be able to do it so every once in awhile we gotta do some practice.",
    "I'm painting people.",
    "So like hitting the top of the lip here, I feel like there's just not as much a room in my painting.",
    "As in her actual face, there's not as much room between the nodes in the lips.",
    "I kind of scrunched up a little too much.",
    "Sadly.",
    "But we can change it.",
    "Luckily 'cause This is photo shop, we can just move something around no problem.",
    "So what should we do?",
    "Can move the eyes up a little bit.",
    "I like to try to find these things in the early earlier stages because you can paint over once you make these adjustments and any little rough edges or selection, residual little selection lines and things can be painted over, you don't really notice it so much by the end.",
    "I find it a little bit more.",
    "You could be a little bit more careful when you're making those changes.",
    "At the end.",
    "You know you can still do them at anytime.",
    "Of course.",
    "But they need to be a little more clean about it.",
    "Can you tell a how are you?",
    "I hope you're having a good day.",
    "So now I can make her lips a little bit more of the right size.",
    "Through her in the portrait.",
    "And we can.",
    "Her lips are parted a little bit too.",
    "So we can show just the tiniest hint of teeth in there.",
    "So all I'm going to do is put like a Gray shadow because all all we're doing is we're peaking in and we're seeing that she has teeth.",
    "But we're not really going to be getting very detailed with them, 'cause it never looks.",
    "It never works out when you draw individual piece in portraits.",
    "Unless you're going for a hyper hyper realism and everything in the picture is highly detailed, then maybe, but for the most part it's best to just kind of hint that teeth.",
    "We paid the earrings later or we skip them.",
    "Sorry if you told it.",
    "Oh, I will probably if I do add those earrings, I'll probably be simplifying them a lot.",
    "We could throw something in there.",
    "Let's let's do it.",
    "So her ears over here, mostly in shadow.",
    "And.",
    "Like if I'm going to paint these earrings with, especially with the amount of time that we have, 'cause I'm looking to try to spend about two 2 1/2 hours on this portrait, I think that's a bit optimistic, but I'm going to try.",
    "And so I can't spend too long on the earrings, but I do think that there.",
    "We can, we can kind of block something in.",
    "So there's a bunch of little details with light hitting.",
    "My internets been pretty bad these days.",
    "What about you?",
    "Oh, I'm sorry about that.",
    "That's super annoying.",
    "When Internet we have Internet problems, especially when.",
    "Internet is so much of the way we can communicate right now, and the way things are.",
    "So I'm sorry, gnutella.",
    "I flipped the image for a couple of reasons.",
    "The main reason is because it gives me a fresh look at what I'm doing.",
    "Usually when I flip the image it helps me see mistakes like I'll notice old I looks too low or something like that.",
    "And when you're looking at the same picture for awhile, it's like you stop being able to see the mistakes anymore.",
    "You know, it's weird, but when you flip it, it kind of tricks your brain into like reprocessing the image.",
    "And sometimes you can see things that you may have overlooked before.",
    "So I flipped the reference.",
    "I flipped the canvas a lot, but I do it even more when I'm painting portraits.",
    "Then, rather than landscapes and stuff like that, I still slip in both but.",
    "Portraits even more because that's when you really want to know if you've got something in the wrong place, or like a little bit.",
    "Cricket or something like that?",
    "Kind of like how.",
    "You know it's nice to stop and take a fresh look at it later, but when you can't do that, or when you're trying to just go through the process.",
    "Flipping it can kind of help give you that.",
    "Fresh look.",
    "To some extent, you know it doesn't.",
    "Doesn't fix everything, but it helps.",
    "I missed the ability to do that when I do traditional painting.",
    "I really do.",
    "You can take your painting and go hold it in front of a mirror or something like that.",
    "Or take a pic photo of it with your phone, but it's not as convenient.",
    "It definitely miss being able to just.",
    "Do a quick flip.",
    "So her hair on this side is covering quite a bit.",
    "We don't see any of the actual ear.",
    "Sucks because I had some homework to turn it in.",
    "I had to call a team to come and fix it.",
    "I'm sorry, I'm glad it's fixed.",
    "It seems like at least you're able to be here now.",
    "Hey Kevin, Why did 2 windows open?",
    "Yeah yeah, it's no problem.",
    "You're welcome to ask any questions, it's just too and you know what I honestly haven't been looking at it that much, so probably should remember to do that, but.",
    "It's to give me a look at my values because sometimes when you're trying to when you're painting in color, it becomes hard to know if your shading is going well, you know.",
    "For some reason it can.",
    "You can feel like.",
    "Everything is working and then turn it into a black and white and check on things and you realize that something is way darker than it should be.",
    "Sometimes when we're painting in color, our perception of Hugh can distort our perception of value, which is the shading.",
    "So it just helps check to see if our shading is doing good.",
    "Oh wow, Steven.",
    "Jeez.",
    "Ha ha ha.",
    "And I suspect.",
    "But a shame we don't get the draw the ears.",
    "I know right?",
    "Too bad we could have gotten some good practice there, but it's just too bad.",
    "If all good now nice, well that's a relief.",
    "OK, so these earrings are really wonky.",
    "The way I drew them.",
    "Let's try to make them the same height.",
    "Try again.",
    "Right, so we've got.",
    "The middle part with a bunch of little details and things, and then the little feathers hanging down.",
    "And then her hair covers the rest of the rings.",
    "Yep, flip alright, we're doing OK.",
    "So the nice thing is we don't really have to get very detailed with those earrings.",
    "Alittle bit is going to go along way and I do want to put in the little turquoise bits at least like a couple of them.",
    "Anyway, for those of you who came in, if you want to grab the brush that I'm using, it's in the free brushes pack that's below the stream in the description.",
    "This one is called soft shading and blending, and it's my favorite brush for painting.",
    "When I do portrait painting.",
    "I really like the softness, but also the way you can kind of sculpt with it because it has one hard edge and one soft edge.",
    "I was talking about the beginning but I know a few people just came in so.",
    "Is that values, yes?",
    "So values of kinda just a fancy word for shading or like the darks and lights the relationship between the darks and lights.",
    "But I do think I'm going to close this now.",
    "Um?",
    "Well, just have the colour version open, but I'll still turn it into black-and-white now and then.",
    "Open my zoom in a little bit.",
    "Alright, want to work on the eyes a little bit.",
    "Maybe that will improve the likeness.",
    "I don't quite have the likeness on this one, although it be totally honest.",
    "I'm not.",
    "I'm not really.",
    "I'm more concerned with making a decent portrait that has good proportions.",
    "I'm not too obsessed with getting the likeness right though.",
    "That's something I want to work towards is getting better with lightness likenesses.",
    "I can usually get there at some point, but it takes me awhile.",
    "Not necessarily able to get a likeness real quick.",
    "When I paid, you know, it takes a lot of back and forth figuring out like what's going on with this person's individual features and like what have I done different?",
    "But You might be able to get it as we keep working.",
    "Highly, how are you?",
    "Welcome.",
    "So she has the.",
    "Sort of.",
    "Smokey eye look.",
    "She has light eyes.",
    "It looks like even though the lighting on her, that area for faces.",
    "There's a lot of shadow, but I do think she's lay eyes.",
    "The.",
    "See the dark pupil.",
    "Now at some point I do have to switch brushes and when I get into super detail stuff because this brush, it only gets so detailed like it's really hard to do detailed things with it.",
    "But it also.",
    "The forces me from from getting too too zoomed in into detailed so it's really nice.",
    "I tried to use this brush for as long as I can.",
    "And then finally switch.",
    "How do you open up to the same projects at once?",
    "Oh, let me show you OK, OK, So what you do is you go to.",
    "Chat helping with this earlier.",
    "OK, you go to window arrange.",
    "Then go all the way down here and then you can make a new window for whatever the file is, it's Open.",
    "OK, so once you have a new window open you have to use the shortcut to turn this into black and white, so that's a separate thing, which I'll also show you and you don't have to do this in a new window.",
    "You can also do this in your regular window, but if you go to view proof, setup custom.",
    "Then you want to select under the proof conditions for the device to simulate select working grade gained 20% and click OK.",
    "So then after you do that, every time you press CTRL Y it'll turn your painting into black and white.",
    "So you can have this one open.",
    "Just leave it there.",
    "And leave this one.",
    "Now.",
    "Regular in color, but you can.",
    "You can turn it into.",
    "You can do control why at anytime with the regular window open, so that's usually what I do.",
    "I don't usually have a separate window open, but I do think it was pretty pretty cool.",
    "I might do it again in the future.",
    "Well, probably do is just have a smaller thumbnail open.",
    "Thank you for typing that out in chat.",
    "Stephanie.",
    "Appreciate it 'cause it's hard to follow in the video when it's going fast.",
    "Oh well, thank you Steve and it makes me feel really good to know that it's helping and that.",
    "Yeah, that because they're learning stuff.",
    "I really appreciate it.",
    "Alright, so I'm giving a little bit of shadow.",
    "Two groups didn't mean to zoom in their little bit of shadow to the hair, especially the side that's away from the light.",
    "And just try to block in the hair.",
    "This this area on the left is a little bit of a puzzle.",
    "The values, so this would be a good time to turn into black and white and turn my reference into black and white and see what's going on here.",
    "So This is why this area is tricky.",
    "Her hair is almost the same value as the background.",
    "It's a little bit darker, but it's really close and in my painting it's lighter so you can see that should be much darker.",
    "If we want to follow the reference, you know we can do our own thing, but you know, if we're doing studies, then we want to learn and we want to see what we're doing wrong.",
    "Yeah, so that's darker things looking better.",
    "And.",
    "Where the hairs like.",
    "Touching her body, there's a little shadow.",
    "I like those shadow are at the little Patch of highlight.",
    "On her shirt.",
    "It's kind of interesting color.",
    "It's like A.",
    "Gray, but it has a little bit of blue in it.",
    "But maybe that's late.",
    "Blue bite.",
    "Don't think I quite don't think wait got the right color yet.",
    "Let's keep going.",
    "We're going to figure this out.",
    "And I might have to use the layer blending mode, sometimes bringing overlay or something like that.",
    "To add some colors, I'm having trouble just getting it right.",
    "But This is why I like keeping things more on the same layer when I'm painting.",
    "In a painterly fashion is because here I can just color pic from the skin.",
    "So hold alt color pic and then just paint over the shirt.",
    "You know if I want to extend the skin or vice versa if I want to share it to be over here might seem like such an obvious thing, but I used to keep some of these elements on different layers and I have to go to a separate layer.",
    "Any race out of that layer.",
    "It have to erase data clothing layer if I wanted to change something like that and then go back to painting the skin underneath and sometimes go back and forth multiple times doing those kind of adjustments.",
    "It just feels so much more free and faster.",
    "Just being able to paint on whatever layer I want.",
    "So that's kind of an example of an area where I felt.",
    "I feel like it's really nice to not have to worry about that.",
    "So there are some little like strappy details going across through shirt.",
    "I'm going to add those later after I would do more shading on the skin.",
    "Could be.",
    "A lot easier to do in that order.",
    "Let's go back to the face for a bit so I know I'm looking at them all over the place, but that's how I'd like to work.",
    "I don't like to spend any like too much time on any one area.",
    "Because then that area will end up getting very.",
    "You know it would get more polished and then the rest of the painting kind of falls behind.",
    "I tried to move around evenly so that.",
    "When it's finished.",
    "Everything is kind of getting finished at around the same time.",
    "Could you put a little bit of a highlight on this side of her lips?",
    "I don't think that's the right color though.",
    "Hum.",
    "Color is that.",
    "I'm trying not to color pic from the reference, just for practice.",
    "You can absolutely color pic from the reference, though it's up to you what you want to do with that, I don't.",
    "And I think it's a.",
    "Problem package depends on what you're trying to work on.",
    "If you're working on studying anatomy.",
    "And it makes it easier to just think about one thing at a time with your study, then you know.",
    "Don't worry about that.",
    "Yes, it is a plug-in Kevin.",
    "You rate so cooler is you can find a link below the stream in the description for Coulouris its third party plugin.",
    "However, if you have Photoshop CC 2019 or any more recent versions then you do have a triangle color wheel available.",
    "So if you go to window color.",
    "In previous versions, before 2019, the default was the Hue Cuban that still available here, but now you can go to the drop down and also select color wheel.",
    "So if you're particularly interested in the triangle color wheel then you can get it without getting any extra plugins.",
    "Um colors does have other features that are cool.",
    "There's like gamut masks and things.",
    "I like the way they display the foreground colors look nice and big butt.",
    "If you're only looking for the triangle color wheel, you can find it in Photoshop now, which is really awesome.",
    "I was happy about that.",
    "Almost tried to flip the stream as if it was my facing that's so funny.",
    "It's funny when your brain gets in that mode.",
    "You must be doing a lot of fainting, Machiavelli.",
    "Your brain is in Photoshop Mode.",
    "Yeah, I'm going to color pic from the photo and see what color is that balance lay on her lip.",
    "There we go.",
    "Not.",
    "I was a bit.",
    "Too late when I chose earlier.",
    "All right, so we can try some.",
    "Details need eyes like the eye lids and eyelashes.",
    "Eyelashes orders a tricky one.",
    "I kind of like to allude to them like putting groups.",
    "Or just the shaded area?",
    "Handsome.",
    "How do you tell him the painting is going to be?",
    "Is there shortcut to rotate your brush so there's some options?",
    "Let me choose a brush that can make it more obvious.",
    "So this brush here you see what it looks like.",
    "You can put the brush under shape dynamics.",
    "You can put the angle jitter onto direction.",
    "Now I will have to shift this brush tips so that it.",
    "Is gorgeous is going at the flat direction of the wide one rather than the.",
    "It's inside, but basically now.",
    "Depending on the direction that I draw in, it's going to go in that direction.",
    "So what I mean?",
    "Oops, I didn't realize I was painting on the same layer.",
    "So I'm I'm not sure if that's what you meant, but yeah, you want to make sure under the brush settings, so whatever brush you have.",
    "You can.",
    "You can, uh.",
    "Turn your angle jitter onto direction on.",
    "The other thing that you can do, and I actually do this alot is you can just manually do it, so sometimes I'll just go here to the underbrush tip shape and turn the tip there because sometimes I like to have like a horizontal or vertical stroke like that.",
    "There might be moments where I have a snack while I painted.",
    "Almost bite to brush.",
    "Alright, so I'm going to switch to a brush with a harder.",
    "And this is this brush is also in that free brush back below my stream and description if you want to download it.",
    "But this brush has looks kind of like a paint stroke but kind of like a chunky one.",
    "It still has a good amount of.",
    "Sharpness to it.",
    "So compared to the brush I was just using which is more soft.",
    "This is when I switched to.",
    "When I'm trying to Polish up the painting a little bit more an I want more hard edges, but I will use the smudge brush to smudge out where I want things to be softer sometimes will make a paint stroke, annual want, one edge to be hard, and the other edge to kind of fade away.",
    "And that's when it's nice to use smudge.",
    "You can't fade away the edge that you want to.",
    "So we could give her some little eyelashes like that.",
    "I don't know how I feel about it.",
    "I always have trouble with this painting makeup.",
    "And having it look natural, I think this is working.",
    "But you know what I mean?",
    "Sometimes I find painting people with makeup on to be more tricky than natural.",
    "So the eyelids underneath the eyelid there's a little bit of light catching so.",
    "Paint that in.",
    "That might be too bright.",
    "Let's let's undo.",
    "So I think the one on the right side is fine, but on the left we want it to be, not as.",
    "Not as brave, it's not quite as close to the light source.",
    "Also, I'm sorry about whatever that noises outside.",
    "There's like some lawn work, suddenly it, so it sounds like.",
    "Hopefully that won't be too loud for you.",
    "So here we can share open up a little.",
    "Corner of the mouth here.",
    "Give her a little purse lipped kind of.",
    "She got a little smirk kind of smile.",
    "I like it.",
    "Did you do a sketch for this one or did you go straight into painting?",
    "I did a sketch and I still have it so I can show you.",
    "Uh, well, that's really hard to see.",
    "Let me Papa, background.",
    "This was the sketch so.",
    "I figured out proportions wise but we didn't get very detailed with it.",
    "But yeah, I think it helped.",
    "Oops.",
    "Although the proportions weren't quite right on that, I did have to use transform a few times on the some of the features earlier on, so I wouldn't say.",
    "You know it was a starting point, but I did end up having to change things from it.",
    "Rendering lipstick is the worst.",
    "I think it went a little bit too dark with.",
    "The details on the lips, so I just cut them onto a new layer and I'm going to lower the Opacity.",
    "No, merge those down.",
    "So I want to zoom out 'cause it's been awhile that I've been zoomed in.",
    "And we need to make sure we can see the whole image and see how it's working.",
    "I'm actually kind of happy with this one.",
    "I'm enjoying it.",
    "I mean, it doesn't look exactly like her, but I like some things about how it's going in the.",
    "Overall feeling, so that's nice.",
    "Let's keep going with it.",
    "We've got time.",
    "So I want to.",
    "He had to 116.",
    "We've been painting this for about an hour and 15 minutes.",
    "So I was going to spend two 2 1/2 hours on this.",
    "So we have more time to Polish things up and work on areas that need work and stuff, so it's good.",
    "I'd like to do a little bit more of the hair too.",
    "So maybe let's do that first.",
    "The hair is.",
    "Maybe the.",
    "The area that's gotten the least attention.",
    "So we'll go with a brighter color up here.",
    "Also, I'm back to my softer brush because the hair isn't quite ready for that hard brush yet, and I don't know if we'll ever move to the harder brush for the hair since we don't want it to be as.",
    "Eye catching as the face.",
    "Who might stick with the softest softer brush for the hair the whole time?",
    "But we'll see.",
    "So we've got these little strands curling around here.",
    "There's a little bit of like a purple kind of bounce light on the hair.",
    "Moldova shined All thank you read, still recognizable.",
    "I'll take it.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Great time to flip.",
    "Take a look from this angle.",
    "Sometimes I slip not just to get a fresh look, but also because it's easier to make certain angled paint strokes from one side to the other, and this might vary.",
    "Depend on if you're right or left-handed, but sometimes it's easier to do something when you flip the image or rotate.",
    "You know a lot of people move the image like this.",
    "I kind of got out of the habit of doing that a while back because I was recording some process videos and I found that once you.",
    "Speed up a video where you've done a lot of that.",
    "It's kind of hard to watch like it will give you a headache.",
    "If you have motion sickness, it's not going to be a good time, so I stopped doing.",
    "I got out of the habit of I know I flip a lot and that can also be a little bit rough, but it's not quite as bad as like rotating all around and.",
    "Also, zooming in and out a ton, I used to zoom way in for detailed stuff.",
    "Anyway, those little things became an issue if you speed your painting up the recording.",
    "If you speed it up quite a lot to a very short video, then it's like it's pretty rough.",
    "So anyway, I stopped rotating my canvas like that and I got out of the habit of it and now I just never do it and everything to do it even though this is a live stream and it wouldn't be a problem.",
    "I'm not trying to make a video, it's.",
    "It's still just like I don't think to do it anymore.",
    "So I like these really warm like almost a reddish orange Brown colors over here where the lights hitting and got that.",
    "Warm glow reflecting off the Heron, maybe through the hair or some kind of subsurface scattering going on.",
    "So turning the layer on and off.",
    "So you see the difference even though it's getting more rendered more clean.",
    "Sometimes there's things that I like about the very rough version, like I do think it's improving, but you know what I mean?",
    "Sometimes it's nice to see that.",
    "Almost like dissolving effect of the areas that are unfinished.",
    "I think it's hard to find a balance with that, but I'm trying to work on it 'cause I really think it's cool.",
    "I like when I see portraits rendered that are like that, like the faces, nice, nicely rendered, and then it kind of dissolves out.",
    "So I'm trying to find my level of.",
    "I don't know how loose to be with that kind of stuff.",
    "OK, so I'm going to go actually back to the airbrush for a little bit I think.",
    "Make a new layer.",
    "I'm going to grab the Airbrush and we're going to do a little bit of Airbrush and lasso tool on the neck and chest area.",
    "I feel like I.",
    "Haven't done enough work down here yet.",
    "So let's do that.",
    "I'm going to give a little bit more shadow under here.",
    "Read says I started doing a mixing chart of my watercolors.",
    "Some just don't mix together.",
    "I mean the result is ugly, not that the painting, not that the paint didn't blend.",
    "Oh, really, is it like a muddy color or something?",
    "That's interesting.",
    "Well, hey, I guess it's good to do the test to find out about that on those test sheet rather than in your painting.",
    "I'm trying to find out what to do with this.",
    "I could go back to my other brush for a second.",
    "Her neck.",
    "And the hair back here.",
    "It kind of.",
    "There's a little bit of a shadow trying to figure out.",
    "The proportions there so look a little bit of a shadow.",
    "Maybe just something like that's enough going overboard.",
    "You can try smudge tool blur.",
    "A little bit of it out.",
    "Yeah, that's better just to save the day.",
    "Thank you Stephanie.",
    "Yeah, I think if you if you detail the right places enough you can get away with leaving leaving other areas.",
    "And I think it's a cool.",
    "I think it's a cool look, and it's also fun because you know, if you want to do portrait study because they can be enjoyable to do and you don't have all the time in the world to render it out, you can still get some good practice in.",
    "You don't have to sit there and render every hair.",
    "To do a study to learn something about the facial features.",
    "But we will do a little bit more, especially because I will be honest.",
    "I might one of a weak point for me is the neck area.",
    "So I need to practice with.",
    "So I'm not going to.",
    "Uh.",
    "Yeah, see that difference.",
    "I want to jump out too soon.",
    "So we get more and shadow over on the side.",
    "The airbrushes nice for some areas that you do want to be smooth.",
    "Of course it makes sense.",
    "Alright, so.",
    "Put a little shadow.",
    "Sometimes when I make a selection to do this sort of airbrush thing, I like to then select the inverse.",
    "If I want to do some shading on the opposite side.",
    "That can be really handy.",
    "Hi Judy, thank you welcome.",
    "Doing a.",
    "Things and portraits.",
    "Today a little bit different.",
    "I know gnutella I really do need that.",
    "Speaking of different topics for art club, I should do a neck and collarbones study.",
    "Study group that would be really good.",
    "Good topic.",
    "But if anybody wants to take a look at the reference image, you can check the link below the stream in the description, and if you'd like to paint along and share what you do, you're welcome to.",
    "We welcome to just hang out and you have any questions, let me know.",
    "We're going to do another portrait after this.",
    "So if you missed the beginning, we will do one more.",
    "So I'm working on the chest right now because there's some.",
    "Details of her shirt that go over top here, so I think it'll be easier if I just sort this out real quick before we add those details.",
    "Your version right?",
    "So you make it Fox.",
    "Oh cool.",
    "I'll take it.",
    "Alright, let me check out jacklines link.",
    "Oh, nice study.",
    "Speaking of facial features.",
    "See, we still have to do mouths.",
    "An art club didn't get there quite yet.",
    "Nice and the neck too.",
    "A lot of complicated wrinkles and stuff.",
    "Nicely done.",
    "Oh nice, Judy Yeah we'll start another one.",
    "After this.",
    "All right, So what I'm doing is making a new layer painting for awhile on that layer until I'm happier with it and then merging down.",
    "So.",
    "At the current sort of polishing up that we're doing here.",
    "And so I'll be able to check and see do I like that and like to me.",
    "I think that went a little too dark in here so I can get rid of that.",
    "I think my interpretation of the lighting has been a bit more, maybe a bit more glowy, less shadows.",
    "I've noticed that when I'm painting, especially if you're painting, uh, a character or a person who is younger or has smooth skin.",
    "Um shadows painting shadows can be really.",
    "Tricky because it can sometimes age them.",
    "And it's so strange 'cause The Shadows will be there in the image and you're thinking, well, hey in the photo their shadows there with the heck I'm just trying to paint it like how it looks and then in the painting it looks like wrinkle or something.",
    "It's really tricky so.",
    "I one thing I found is like I think I tend to be a little bit more glowy or a little bit later on the shadows.",
    "For that reason, if I'm painting someone like this.",
    "Sorry for the flipping so much.",
    "I'm trying to figure out what.",
    "What is bothering me about the this area and sometimes the flipping.",
    "Really helps.",
    "So I'm going to color pic from this light spot on her face.",
    "An shifted a little bit to a cooler.",
    "Colour, but keep that brightness.",
    "For the highlights on her skin down here, 'cause it seems a lot.",
    "Um?",
    "Cooler, the lighting on her chest.",
    "Hi Taj.",
    "Welcome, I hope you guys are having a good day.",
    "Right, that's a little bit better.",
    "I have some sketch lines still here.",
    "If I zoom in you can see what I did earlier on in the process was I merged my sketch onto my painting so you can take the smudge brush and smudge away those lines.",
    "So they kind of blend in.",
    "Read says 1 trick.",
    "I read about this is this often is tomorrow.",
    "Yes, often the shadows on young people and do more hard edged shadows on aged people.",
    "Oh interesting, that makes sense.",
    "Make sense read.",
    "Have you used the same brush throughout?",
    "Yeah, I I don't mind questions at all.",
    "You're welcome to ask and I have used mostly the same brush.",
    "I'll show you the ones I've used so I have this one right here, which is this is the one I've used for most of the painting.",
    "The only other brush I've used is the airbrush an I've used this smudge brush so those have been the.",
    "Oh, there was one other brushed.",
    "Almost forgot.",
    "There was one of the brush and that was this one for some of the harder details, but all of these brushes, all four of them are in the free brush set that you can download below the stream in the description if you want the ones I used was the wet paint, the soft airbrush and the soft shading and blending, but this was this was the hero right here?",
    "This is the main one I really like that brush for painting portraits.",
    "Definitely a go to for me.",
    "Oh, I think that I'm about to answer your question Taj, because I think there's a little delay in the stream, so I think you're about to hear me answer your question, but if not, ask me again and I will tell you.",
    "OK, so I'm going to add the details of her shirt here.",
    "Real quick going across.",
    "I wanted to paint the skin first, 'cause I thought it would just be easier, but I think we're ready now.",
    "Well, we got food.",
    "That's about right.",
    "Actually, there's three.",
    "Not that we have to really make the exact same shirt, but you know.",
    "Try again, right?",
    "I'm going to put a layer on overlay and grab the Airbrush.",
    "Oh cool, nice to yeah, that's a really good brush for portraits.",
    "I almost never use it on landscapes, but I like it for people.",
    "OK, so I'm going to take the.",
    "Airbrush and choose like a blue, blue greenish color over here and.",
    "Actually maybe more towards purple, but I feel like her shirt.",
    "I've got it.",
    "I've got like a Gray color here, but I feel like the light is more blue in the image.",
    "So we'll do something like that.",
    "OK, so.",
    "Yeah, her shirt.",
    "I'm not really that happy with it.",
    "I think it has to do with the texture.",
    "Maybe I can kind of scribble in something here, but The thing is, I don't want to attract attention to the shirt.",
    "I want the attention to be on her face.",
    "But maybe there's some.",
    "Little details because of the hair light shining through the hair and maybe if we have.",
    "That shadow that'll Make more sense.",
    "I just wanted to be clear that this random Patch of blue is related to light and not just like a weird discoloration on her shirt, and I don't think I sold that yet.",
    "You know?",
    "It looks like it's getting a little bit better.",
    "Debating of adding the earring or not.",
    "Yeah, mine are a bit rough.",
    "But And I don't know if it's really needed to go much more detailed.",
    "I was thinking about adding like some just harder.",
    "A little bit harder highlights randomly for a bit to look like a glimmer out of focus.",
    "Little glimmer on the.",
    "The ring and that could make it look more metallic.",
    "But again, all those little things are adding noise and detail and distraction to areas other than her face.",
    "So I'm using this much brush to blur out some of the edges.",
    "I really want to keep the most interesting part, the most detailed part to be her face.",
    "In the earrings can compete with that.",
    "We can give a little shine to the eyes, but haven't done that yet.",
    "That's always fun.",
    "So I'm seeing a little shine, will get through like a blue light.",
    "Little white blue actually.",
    "Desaturate a little more.",
    "So something like this and then sometimes what I like to do is erase out.",
    "So make a big shimmer and then kind of cut into it in a couple of places and I can look like those you know.",
    "Like maybe it's shining through her eyelashes or something like that.",
    "Or you know the reflection of various objects that have different.",
    "Details in them.",
    "During say so much about personality, that's true, yeah?",
    "Little bit of personal files coming through there.",
    "Her lips don't have.",
    "She is kind of like a matte lip color on.",
    "I can add a little bit of detail there, but for the most part her lips aren't very shiny or anything.",
    "Of course we could take artistic license and the as shine, but.",
    "I think they look good.",
    "The way they are.",
    "Little bit shine on the edge of the nose.",
    "The I sign is always satisfying to put in.",
    "I really toned it down a bit though, because once you zoom out it's funny.",
    "What reads will add a distance and what doesn't.",
    "Sometimes those things can be really distracting.",
    "So one thing I notice she is very long eyelashes and in the photo actually some of her eyelashes are coming out into the light bar enough that they're like catching the sunlight a little bit.",
    "So I'm not going to bother with that, but that's just like something to note.",
    "I guess is that.",
    "Sometimes eyelashes, even though she has a dark eyelashes.",
    "In the light, you may actually try to indicate them with highlight.",
    "Can't we are hearing because of allergies?",
    "All I'm sorry red.",
    "I guess, huh?",
    "While I've I've heard of that was like different types of metals and stuff like that.",
    "To be honest, I almost never wear earrings.",
    "I have like a couple pairs that you rings that I wear every once in awhile, but.",
    "I usually find it most comfortable not to really wear.",
    "Where stuff like that.",
    "So I'm putting a couple little flyaways and things little shines.",
    "I'm trying to decide if they really fit or not.",
    "I think I like the shines up top.",
    "Not sold on the random flyways yet though.",
    "Alright, we have a lighter highlight on the hair.",
    "Down here is less of a warm color.",
    "More bright white.",
    "Maybe part of the reason it doesn't fit so well.",
    "These really, really bright lights is because I kind of toned, toned it down a little bit in mind like we don't have a totally overexposed thing.",
    "We could add some color Dodge this, just play with it.",
    "I'm going to make a new layer, put it on color, Dodge and turn off the transparency shapes layer so one more time.",
    "If you have a layer and you select a color, dodges your layer blending mode.",
    "You can paint.",
    "And it's going to have this kind of effect, but I prefer how it looks if you double tap the layer and uncheck transparency shapes layer, it'll give the color Dodge a little bit of a different effect.",
    "This is I've changed, nothing else, only that and it, and I think it makes it a lot better.",
    "It depends on what you're using the color Dodge for, but for painting I like to do that.",
    "So we can just come in an add some extra little pop of light in the areas where it's just following the reference and we'll just see what we think about it.",
    "Let's just do it and see what we think about it.",
    "We could judge too soon.",
    "Codage can really overexpose stuff and it can be a bit too much, but it can also be really beautiful and kind of bump up lighting that you already have going on.",
    "I usually don't use color Dodge to do the lighting about a sometimes use it to add a little extra after you've already painted an area to go back in and.",
    "Brighten things up a little bit more so you can see this.",
    "Effect over on the shoulder.",
    "It was a little bit more like the actual photo.",
    "If we do something like this.",
    "And.",
    "That is kind of fun actually.",
    "So before and after.",
    "So I kind of like what it did with the hair, specially on the right.",
    "I feel like what it did on her face is a bit too much, so I'm going to take a big airbrush and just kind of tap over her face and start erasing that out.",
    "And then let's see.",
    "Yeah, I want her face to be.",
    "This is more of like from behind her.",
    "Almost what's happening with the.",
    "The lighting Ha, that's funny crazy.",
    "Yeah, that's right, read.",
    "Well, I'm going to duplicate the background layer well, my painting and.",
    "Do merge the color Dodge layer down.",
    "So I'm going to keep both versions.",
    "2.",
    "I'm going to keep both versions, but I want to try smudging this a little bit after the color Dodge.",
    "This seemed really harsh.",
    "Some of those up here.",
    "Hoping maybe I could smash that out and I will improve.",
    "Where was this option?",
    "OK, so one more time with the color Dodge 'cause, so this is a weird thing, but I don't really know what it's doing, but it's it's awesome so you double click the layer and under the blending options it's what should come up by default when you double click the layer you uncheck the transparency shapes layer and then press OK and then then you want to put your layer on color Dodge mode.",
    "There's another way to get this effect too.",
    "If you make a new layer and you fill a black paint bucket on the layer, and then you put that layer on color, Dodge, and paint, it's going to have the exact same effect too, as if you did the uncheck transparency shapes layer thing.",
    "So it's the same thing.",
    "I don't know why it works.",
    "But it works.",
    "OK, well there's our.",
    "There's our portrait of the time it is.",
    "I could work on it a little bit more, but I feel like.",
    "I feel like it's, uh.",
    "Right, I feel like I'm happy with it.",
    "For a quick study portrait.",
    "The area may be catching my attention a little bit.",
    "Is the corners of the mouth.",
    "Maybe our little too dark or too.",
    "Desaturated.",
    "OK so I'm going to put the layer on a layer on Layton.",
    "And paint in.",
    "Like a warm Brown red.",
    "To lighten up a little bit so light and is really cool.",
    "Lighten and darken layer blending modes actually use a lot.",
    "I think that kind of underrated, but what they do is when you're painting on lighten mode, it's going to only affect layers.",
    "I mean, sorry colors that are darker than the one you're painting with, so you can see as I paint across her.",
    "It's only going to lighten the dark areas.",
    "It's not going to do anything to the light areas, so you can.",
    "So I can lighten those details of her on her in her lip area, but it doesn't affect any of the area that's already been painted that is.",
    "Lighter.",
    "David says you can also paint into a black layer with the additive blend mode.",
    "There is an additive effects composite.",
    "Oddly is that transparency is done after the full composite up to the layer.",
    "Yeah, so the one I used to do David before I found out about the black layer is I would like I would just be like I need to merge everything.",
    "You know what I mean 'cause I would I would love how it looked if I you know if you paint another thing you can do is if you have everything merged.",
    "You can paint with your brush.",
    "On color Dodge mode.",
    "So before I found out about using the black layer or using the transparency shapes layer, what I would do when I was just kind of playing around figuring things out I would I would have.",
    "I would merge everything and then I would put my brush on color Dodge Mode and I would use that.",
    "And I was so.",
    "Like I thought it was so wild that how, how things looked when I would work like this was so different.",
    "And so I would usually save color Dodge for like one of the last things I would do in a painting an I would merge everything and use the.",
    "The color Dodge over here on the brush.",
    "So all these other ways are much better and much less destructive, which is awesome.",
    "But I definitely get what you're saying about the transparency.",
    "That's something that started to.",
    "I started to notice just because of like how things were working.",
    "Like if I was doing it on a layer that wasn't merged any of the area.",
    "Yeah, it's you're right, it's not necessary.",
    "It's not super intuitive, but it's at the same time when you deal with it a lot.",
    "You could start to see the patterns of how it's working.",
    "Strange thing about the way Photoshop does composite operation.",
    "Basically because every layer is doing multiple composites blend mode plus transparency flows opacity.",
    "Well, thank you.",
    "Thank you so much faster.",
    "Thanks you guys.",
    "Um, we're going to do another portrait from the start together.",
    "Now I'm going to take a quick moment to get some more water and just take a quick stretch in between paintings here.",
    "But it'll be like just a couple minutes at most so it'll be pretty fast and I'm just kind of get up, stretch and come back for a new portrait.",
    "So if you guys want to join in the next one, the reference images below the stream in the description.",
    "Reference image #2 you can find down there.",
    "And.",
    "Also, above the chat, in the info tab you can find the reference there too, so this is the next one we're going to do.",
    "We're having with the lovely ladies being day.",
    "I just have been saving these images for awhile and.",
    "Yeah, was in the mood to do this, so I hope you guys like them.",
    "We're going to do that one next so I will quickly whoops.",
    "I'll click quickly, go on the Barbie screen and come back if you guys have any paintings you want to share.",
    "If you were painting along with me on this last one, I would love to see what you did.",
    "Take your time.",
    "There's no rush, but whenever you want you can upload into.",
    "Into the chat your are you do have to post it somewhere so that you can get a URL and then put the URL in the chat and I'll check it out.",
    "Really pretty Jackson.",
    "Thank you so much for painting with me.",
    "I always enjoy seeing your work.",
    "Hey Ryan.",
    "Welcome anybody who got here while I was away on a quick break.",
    "We are back.",
    "Hey guys.",
    "So we're going to do thank you.",
    "Thank you for the welcome back everybody.",
    "We're going to do another portrait and I'm just going to get set up.",
    "If anybody was painting along for the last one.",
    "If anyone else.",
    "We just took a look at Jackson's work.",
    "If anyone else wants to share you can post.",
    "You're in the chat whenever you're ready.",
    "You can feel free to like.",
    "Keep going on it, no rush, share whatever.",
    "To get set up with the next one, we're going to do paint this woman holding.",
    "Yellow Flowers So let's get our reference.",
    "This is the image we're going to be painting.",
    "I find profile views pretty tough.",
    "This is basically a profile we can see a little bit of her eye peeking from the other side, so I think that's going to be a little challenging, but.",
    "Good thing to practice and there's an ear in this one.",
    "We are studying ears as part of the current art club topics.",
    "I wanted to pick one of our portraits today that showed an ear.",
    "So yeah, this is the next one and you guys can find the link below in the description stream description.",
    "If you want to grab the reference and do a quick sketch with us or paint along and I'm going to put the.",
    "The reference up here with pure ref.",
    "There we go.",
    "Thank you valya.",
    "Thank you, so if you guys wanted to see the first one, if you were.",
    "If you were just getting here and you weren't here for the first painting after stream, you can always re watch the video.",
    "It'll be available on my profile on the videos tab you can find it there.",
    "Usually it takes a couple hours after the stream to process the video and then it will be available.",
    "Hyper welcome everybody.",
    "Alright, I'm going to make an you canvas.",
    "OK, so the canvas size is true 1000 by 2500 pixels.",
    "That is the size of the reference image and I think that's a good size for me.",
    "I am just doing these for practice.",
    "I'm probably not going to be printing them, so that's plenty big enough.",
    "I think for practice and for something that I might just post on line.",
    "So that's big enough.",
    "And then let's say that.",
    "Half a woman with.",
    "Yellow Flowers I like the title my paintings, as if their stock photo titles.",
    "Your hype, yay.",
    "OK.",
    "So I'm going to talk through my process.",
    "You guys are welcome to ask questions you have any.",
    "See if I can move this over a little bit.",
    "And what time is it?",
    "Oh, we're doing pretty good so I could spend.",
    "I have with them out of time I have to stream today I'm looking to make this portrait like a two to three hour portrait, so that's the plan.",
    "For the next one, the profile SRO referee link could be pretty useful, at least for me.",
    "Thank you for bringing that up.",
    "I'm almost forgot about that.",
    "So earlier you guys earlier I shared a an image for the first portrait that I did I was looking or I had in mind this reference and I added it to my reference page.",
    "This is a.",
    "Planes of the head model created by John SRO.",
    "This is I forgot the year.",
    "This is pretty old now.",
    "I think it's from like the 70s, but this is great design.",
    "It's really helpful.",
    "You can find photos of this.",
    "The link is below in the description you can find a link to download these photos.",
    "Someone uploaded them for free on Polycount which is really nice that you can grab them and use them for studying and in your art.",
    "So this is one that would probably be pretty good.",
    "Or maybe the other ones even further to the side.",
    "But it really helps if you're feeling confused about the angles of a face.",
    "To look at that.",
    "OK, so I'm going to get rid of the black.",
    "Sorry the white background first of all.",
    "And.",
    "I might just, instead of popping in, I usually just pop in a Gray background.",
    "But this time the background in the actual reference bit of actual photo is.",
    "Basically a gradient with a lot of Gray in it, so I think what I'm going to do instead of dropping a paint bucket is.",
    "Just.",
    "Try to match what I'm seeing in the reference.",
    "Just have a starting point.",
    "So.",
    "One thing that I like to do at the beginning of a painting is sort of take my time and take a moment to actually really look at the picture and I'll turn it into black and white.",
    "And see like what is the brightest thing in the image?",
    "What is the darkest thing you know?",
    "What are the values look like?",
    "Overall, the background is so her skin in most places is about the same tone as the background.",
    "It's a little bit darker, but then some areas the highlights are lighter.",
    "So the dress is darker than the background.",
    "The hair is much darker, but looking at those relationships with the shading and values kind of helps me out.",
    "And taking a moment to just, you know, think through it a little bit before starting.",
    "That can be good to do.",
    "So I'm going to grab a sketch brush.",
    "Or any brush relief.",
    "Any brushes, small scale size.",
    "You can schedule it basically so I'm going to take this one and just start start sketching it in an if you guys were here on the last one you saw and you'll see here too that my sketches are often really messy when first starting out.",
    "I'm hoping this is something that's just going to get better with time I feel like my environment sketching his improved a bit.",
    "I haven't been practicing on humans that much, but my sketches are like looking like stick figures most of the time when I start and so I've just kind of come to terms with it.",
    "But Luckily you can build on top of that, so I'll usually start out with something that's pretty rough.",
    "And then if I do want to make it more clean and more polished, I'll just turn that layer onto lower opacity and trace over it.",
    "And clean it up and you can just do that as many times as you need to to get it looking better.",
    "Which is which is awesome.",
    "The negative is sometimes your original sketch will have a little bit more like gesture and motion to it.",
    "So if the kind of be careful with that when you're polishing sketches up that they sometimes they will lose that.",
    "Motion to them but.",
    "Alright, let's flip.",
    "I'm going to flip my reference on the other monitor to while I'm doing this.",
    "Sometimes it'll help me notice things.",
    "Angles and things high pablos.",
    "How are you?",
    "Going to choose the harder brush for my eraser.",
    "I don't like having an airbrush is my eraser ahead like that from the previous painting.",
    "I'm near good to see you.",
    "So part of her is covered by the Flowers, so it's a little tricky, but I think basically what's happening is.",
    "Her upper body is like this.",
    "And she just she has the Flowers here.",
    "And holding them toward her an I'm going to just sketch the.",
    "Outline of the flower shape.",
    "Of the whole bouquet.",
    "Something like that.",
    "Jennifer says I have sketches from Disney pioneers that look very messy and then more detailed so you're doing good.",
    "Thank you.",
    "That's good to hear.",
    "Yeah, it's almost always a mess with the beginning.",
    "Way too often I like the sketch more than the final product, so it's a good tip.",
    "Yeah, I try to.",
    "I try to like if I do like a more polished version.",
    "I try to turn on and off the and look at the sketch layer.",
    "And try to keep it in mind for that.",
    "So hard, isn't it?",
    "So I'm just going back on top of my sketch now and sort of solidifying some of the lines that I like.",
    "I'm happy with.",
    "And ignoring the ones that I don't really care for.",
    "Hey pro designer, I hope you're having a good day.",
    "I made some mango P today.",
    "Smells very good.",
    "He is a must have for painting or.",
    "For coffee or coffee.",
    "Alright, looking at the head proportions we got a little work to do.",
    "So I like to look at where things match up.",
    "To help give me idea of what I'm doing, like for example her shoulder here kind of matches up with where her chin starts and then how far does that come out and about.",
    "Where does that line up with the Flowers?",
    "Things like that helps find out their relationships in size between things.",
    "Like her neck over here.",
    "I think so it comes out the bun.",
    "The edge of the shirt kind of meets up with a bun like that.",
    "Is almost like more of a mathematical way of thinking about it so.",
    "Maybe it's not as appealing, but it does help those help.",
    "If you're like just checking proportions and things.",
    "I want to make sure that it's making sense.",
    "Fish in it does taste good that he does taste good, it just it has such a strong smell to it more than usual for T discuss the mango so intense.",
    "I like it.",
    "He's also must have for watching the stream.",
    "Ohio cheers.",
    "I hope you're having a good day fishing.",
    "I can show you the painting, we just did.",
    "Actually we're starting a new one at the moment, but this was the first one.",
    "So I'm.",
    "The the lighting in this one was like absolutely my favorite.",
    "I love the lighting.",
    "This one is a little bit less.",
    "Maybe a little less glamorous lighting.",
    "But Hopefully we can still do something good with it.",
    "I find certain types of lighting scenarios little bit easier.",
    "And generally I feel like when there's a bright splash of light.",
    "I find that easier and I don't know why.",
    "I have some hypothesis of why it is.",
    "But I think it makes it well.",
    "I think the drama is always nice.",
    "It's just sort of flashy and pretty.",
    "But I think it's also easier to get make things look 3 dimensional when you have the angles really harshly illuminated, and sometimes when the lighting is more even.",
    "You don't.",
    "You can't do that as easily.",
    "Address of Mario dressed in a Ferrari suit.",
    "Haven't finished it yet.",
    "Well, you're welcome to share it.",
    "If you want to, or if you want to wait till it's finished.",
    "The other great out a portrait I haven't in a long time I when I was in school we had to do some portraits that were grid out.",
    "And I found it really useful as far as like getting accurate results, but I don't love to paint that way regularly or draw that way regularly because it feels kind of.",
    "It's not as fun to me.",
    "It takes a little.",
    "I I just it's just not as fun, you know?",
    "And I really want to get better at Freehand, so that's mostly the reason I don't do it, but but with what I was talking about with matching up and looking at proportions in a way that is kind of greeting, it's just sort of a like Mini.",
    "Version of it just kind of observing how things match up.",
    "Oh, thank you.",
    "Fishing was thank you.",
    "It was a beautiful photo.",
    "Photo that I was painting from.",
    "Oh, that sounds good.",
    "I'm glad you were able to get out and about a little bit.",
    "Like these days.",
    "Thank you bro.",
    "Hey Emily, good to see you.",
    "Gave some some proportions, things with the.",
    "Yeah, I think this angle is going to be little tricky for me.",
    "So it's almost the profile.",
    "Would you guys call this a profile view?",
    "Does it count?",
    "It's like almost a profile, but there's just a little bit of her eyes showing from the side.",
    "I'm not even sure if there's an official word for what this is.",
    "Angle live.",
    "Right, so I like to flip the canvas quite a bit when I'm painting portraits to help me notice things that are wonky.",
    "It's definitely raining.",
    "Putting some alarms off in my head right now.",
    "When I'm flipping, looking at the eyes and stuff.",
    "Uhm Yeah.",
    "Scenary Hi Welcome.",
    "Thanks for being here.",
    "France is not here yet, but sometimes if I'm doing a Commission and I really need to nail a likeness but generally don't take the path of least resistance.",
    "Yeah, yeah, that would be.",
    "That would be a good time to do it.",
    "Definitely, then you want to have as little yeah you little room for mistakes possible.",
    "But It's funny you say path of least resistance.",
    "I do agree that in some ways it makes things easier because you know it lines things up for you, but in other ways I find it it harder because I find it hard to discipline to do all that kind of preparation with greeting everything out before painting things like drawing.",
    "I just want to get to it.",
    "So I gotta say give people credit who who do that because I don't think it's necessarily is definitely a lot of work involved.",
    "Definitely a lot of work involved in setting that up so.",
    "Alright, so there should be more so looking at proportions there should be more room.",
    "Between her or her eyebrow and.",
    "The hairline beginning.",
    "At that counts as a profile.",
    "OK, cool, you're a nice.",
    "Alright.",
    "We're painting a profile.",
    "Yeah, I'm having a good day pro.",
    "I've been really enjoying stream so far.",
    "Is going by quickly actually?",
    "But it's a good day.",
    "One thing that you can do to sort of check your work which is.",
    "Honestly, this this is a bit.",
    "It can be a bit rough emotionally 'cause you're like.",
    "Oh, you're going to see really how off things are, but you can take the reference and paste it on top of your work and then.",
    "Look like this.",
    "Now of course, her positioning is a little different, but I can do this kind of thing and see.",
    "So.",
    "Proportions Of the like lips and nose and chin are not bad, but look at the ear was going on there.",
    "So I made the ear way too big.",
    "But anyway, this kind of stuff, even though it can be a bit jarring when you'd lined it up and you realize all the mistakes.",
    "It's good for learning an check, checking your work, and if you don't have like someone there to give you a feedback real quick and you want to try to get that info for yourself, that's a way you can look at it.",
    "If you're painting from one specific.",
    "Reference then you can overlap it like that.",
    "Take a look.",
    "Right, there's 100% agree I find greeting out of drawing harder takes longer, so just going freehand or whatever, not use any grid, is the passively path of least resistance to me too.",
    "OK, I understand what you said.",
    "Now I understand.",
    "I think I read it the opposite way first.",
    "Yeah, definitely definitely.",
    "Reached resistance to just get in and start drawing it out.",
    "He drawing lips at this angle.",
    "Mine always turn out like fish list.",
    "Well, when we get to the lifts maybe I can give some some tips on that that's funny.",
    "Do you prefer digital sketching?",
    "Painting over using a good old pencil and paint brush?",
    "You know, I, I find it impossible to choose between digital and traditional like it's so hard and I know it's been copping out, but I can never answer this question like I love both mediums.",
    "I do both regularly.",
    "And I would be really sad if I had to like give up either digital or traditional.",
    "I'm not sure 'cause there's there's there's little pros and cons here in there with both of 'em like digital is so much more.",
    "Versus Thailand Editable and you know you can just try things on a whim, whereas with the traditional you know, let's say you've done a nice painting so far and you have an idea for something you want to try out, but then you're worried?",
    "Oh, I'm going to mess up my whole painting if I do that now.",
    "You can just experiment so freely in digital.",
    "You don't have those issues that holding you back as much.",
    "For me.",
    "Speaking for me, I don't get held back by that feeling in digital.",
    "I'm like willing to try whatever because you know, there's no loss.",
    "You can just.",
    "Undo or go back if you don't like it.",
    "There's so many editing tools which makes things easier like for me I'm able to move around.",
    "I mean look at all the changes I've made to her already, so I would have had to take a very different approach if I was doing this.",
    "Traditionally, I probably would have spent a lot longer in the first rough sketch phase that I did hear.",
    "I probably would have not gone through that so quick knowing that I need to maybe make changes.",
    "Yeah, it's different.",
    "However, as far as like pros and cons, something that I like about traditional is the textures.",
    "And I find that in my digital work I'm always experimenting with how I can imitate those textures, and I do feel like the technology is getting better for that, but I still find that there are certain looks of are really tough could recreate.",
    "So yeah, there's pros and cons to both, but I like doing both 'cause I feel like they help inspire each other, like doing traditional I think has made my digital work more a little bit more interesting lately because I'm really trying to bring in those texture things into my digital work.",
    "Oh, thank you you are that's so nice of you.",
    "Thank you.",
    "They're trying to scale up on digital painting.",
    "Had to do some quick sketches the other day and pencil realize how much I rely on control Z.",
    "Yeah, for me the transform tools like this are so handy 'cause it's You'll draw a nose and it's like, OK.",
    "The nose is fine, but it's like a little bit too far over in traditionally erase the whole thing is just a lot faster to be able to just move it over or use warp stuff like that.",
    "And we both grading is actually transferred technique used for murals.",
    "So basically when grading you don't do much more than copy something without thought about shapes and forms.",
    "I would recommend your technique.",
    "And I did use a grid for for doing a mural.",
    "It's really hard to paint a mural and keep things in proportion 'cause you're like so close to what you're painting, and it's so big it's like impossible to get a step to get a proper step back view of it.",
    "I asked one question last Wednesday.",
    "Do you remember that?",
    "Oh what my favorite painting is.",
    "Yeah, I still don't know.",
    "I don't think I can choose one painting that's too hard pro.",
    "It's too hard like.",
    "I don't know.",
    "I don't think I can choose one painting that I that resonates with me above all others.",
    "There's too many paintings that I love.",
    "Too many paintings.",
    "Like if I had to look at one painting forever.",
    "If I could only hang up one painting.",
    "I don't know.",
    "I don't know which one it would be.",
    "And why are the lips so hard?",
    "Alright, there slightly parted.",
    "So I do think I'm going to be able to sort some of these things out more in the.",
    "In the painting phase, but I'm trying to.",
    "Get a little bit closer.",
    "Before I go into painting.",
    "Trying to at least.",
    "Please get to a point where the painting will be.",
    "I have some some guidance for myself, so that's why I'm doing this sketch.",
    "So her eyes are slightly open there.",
    "She's looking down.",
    "Yeah, I agree, she does look like a dancer.",
    "The way she's holding that pose.",
    "Oh Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, I wonder if I can find it.",
    "So here is asking about a painting I did a while back.",
    "I mentioned the other day that.",
    "I would go look it up.",
    "Um so.",
    "Off topic from the.",
    "From the painting for a moment.",
    "I've done a lot of I do a lot of virtual Plein Air Studies and speed paints and things like that.",
    "I've been mostly focused on environments, but when I started doing time studies, I wasn't strictly doing environments.",
    "I was also doing more portraits, not more portraits and environments, but more portraits than what I'm doing nowadays.",
    "I was still doing quite a bit of portraits sprinkled in here we go.",
    "So this is from.",
    "Let's see, when is this from?",
    "It's what is the date on this file?",
    "September of 2018.",
    "So this is getting close to two years ago.",
    "Now, but this is a.",
    "45 minutes study of Lagertha.",
    "I promise I will show it to.",
    "Tiara, so here it is, yeah.",
    "I didn't get very far.",
    "It's crazy the what this looks like, so I was using a triangular brush right now.",
    "It almost looks like one of those Polygon type paintings.",
    "But yeah, that was my only painting of legacy.",
    "Uh.",
    "I should try again now.",
    "See for me, profiles are the hardest to draw.",
    "Yeah, I also find them really difficult, so this should be good practice.",
    "You guys are able to actually choose a favorite painting.",
    "I'm impressed.",
    "I am impressed.",
    "When I painting broken column from Freda, I'm gonna have to look that up now.",
    "Ah, cool.",
    "I'm not familiar with that one.",
    "OK, well I'll get back to.",
    "I'll get back to my painting but very interesting you guys.",
    "Thanks for sharing.",
    "Yeah, maybe one day I'll think of find a favorite painting, but I've never been good at choosing favourites of things.",
    "You know what I mean?",
    "It comes with songs, movies.",
    "It's always like it depends a bit on on mood and all kinds of things.",
    "It kind of changes overtime and it's hard to think of one that's just the ultimate favorite.",
    "Because there's, you know they do different things.",
    "Oh, thank you Claire Z.",
    "Thanks, Foster.",
    "Yarra I appreciate it.",
    "Almost like heavy paint app, I've been really wanting to try that app Makaveli.",
    "I opened it and I like I was like.",
    "This is crazy.",
    "Seems really hard, but kind of a fun challenge.",
    "Thanks you guys.",
    "Thanks for the nice comments.",
    "She's so pretty that actress.",
    "I don't know the name of the real of actress, but that the woman who plays Lagertha's is really beautiful.",
    "So I was excited to try to paint her.",
    "Alright, well.",
    "I'm really struggling with this eyebrow like I understand that this one it's going like this by for some reason.",
    "I'm having a really hard time.",
    "It's like I can see that it's going down.",
    "But I can't seem to paint it like that.",
    "Like this?",
    "Right?",
    "Yeah.",
    "Well I am just going to have to start and sort this out in the painting phase because for some reason drawing these eyes it's just.",
    "Absolutely breaking my brain right now.",
    "It's something like this.",
    "Jennifer says that's exactly why I love art.",
    "You don't have to have one favorite all the time.",
    "It could change with how you're feeling.",
    "Just like music.",
    "Yeah, just like that.",
    "It's it's hard to pick a favorite song.",
    "And painting.",
    "OK, well I think that's.",
    "As close as I'm going to get for now.",
    "Let's start with the painting.",
    "So I'm going to put the layer on, multiply an lower the opacity so that we can barely see it.",
    "But it is still there as a guide, and then I'll lock that layer.",
    "Anne will make a new layer and start painting, so I'm going to go back to this soft shading and blending brush, which I was using for the first painting today.",
    "And.",
    "You can find this brush in the free brushes past below the stream in the description if you want.",
    "But I'm going to be using this one and I'm trying to begin without color picking from the reference.",
    "Will see on my end up color picking if I get stuck and we want to get unstuck.",
    "But I'm going to try to visualize it.",
    "She has a ton of freckles when she's not wearing makeup.",
    "She's so pretty.",
    "Katheryn Winnick.",
    "Oh, really.",
    "She has a lot of freckles.",
    "I wonder why they did they.",
    "I don't remember in the show.",
    "I wonder why they would cover the freckles.",
    "Anyway, that's that's cool.",
    "I'll have to look her up.",
    "Maybe we can do a portrait of her.",
    "Mine's gone very Freda Calo.",
    "I'm referring to the state of her eyebrows, not my style of drawing.",
    "I don't know why, but the eyebrows were the hardest part of this for me.",
    "I hope you have a digital pen or stylus.",
    "Hi Saurav, I hope you can too.",
    "I hope you can do.",
    "So digital painting it's definitely a lot easier and more workable with a stylus, but there are other types of digital art you could get into if you can't get a stylus quite yet.",
    "Vector art could be a really good option in the meantime.",
    "If you use something like Adobe illustrator because that type of art is a bit more possible to do with with a mouse or Pixel Art's or.",
    "Vector style clean vector style artwork could definitely work or you can always, you know, do some pencil and paper sketching and preparation.",
    "But there are definitely things you can do in the mean time.",
    "If you want.",
    "I hope you're able to get a Silas soon.",
    "I have three depending on mood.",
    "Ooh, good choices.",
    "Ioras sharing a link Oh wow.",
    "Yeah, I see I see.",
    "Time jump makeup test.",
    "Nice freckles Medford new yeah yeah that's cool.",
    "I wonder if she has other roles she's done with the freckles showing.",
    "But she's a good actress.",
    "OK, so I'm blocking in the whole body in the same color right now, just because I want to.",
    "Get this.",
    "Get this box in, will get will get more specific with the dress and this and that.",
    "OK, so.",
    "For the last painting, I painted her attached to the background and I'm really considering doing that here too for a more painterly effect.",
    "I don't know if I want to paint the details of what's going on behind her.",
    "It looks like a bed.",
    "Like a headboard of a bed or something like that.",
    "And I mean it's pretty, but I want the focus beyond her.",
    "If anything I might do something abstract back there.",
    "Like we could have some.",
    "Something like this so it looks like she's she's in a room and maybe there's some kind of details furniture, or who knows a window.",
    "We whatever is back there, you know.",
    "Something blurred out.",
    "Might do something like this and just start painting with her right on the background.",
    "what I like about that is then you can sort of paint back and forth with the background and foreground color and not have to erase out what would make sense to do first is to block in the her clothing color so she's all on one layer now so I'll press the lock transparency and.",
    "That way I can anything that I paint.",
    "It's only going to affect the layer that I already, the shape that I already created on that layer.",
    "Oh, it's going to be about two to three hours vision like you said, mainly just to the end of stream.",
    "So probably two to three hours for this one.",
    "Which I think it is going to take more time than the last one seems tricky.",
    "So doing something like this is a lot easier.",
    "Before we flatten it to the background.",
    "And you don't have to flatten yours.",
    "I'm a little bit merge happy, but.",
    "This is how I like to do it.",
    "But the her she's got very dark Brown.",
    "Black hair, it looks like it's reflecting a little bit, highlights a little bit Brown.",
    "That's very dark.",
    "And very striking with the red dress.",
    "All red I'm sorry.",
    "That sounds like a stressful situation, but I think he did the right thing.",
    "I mean, you were just looking out for him.",
    "It's like you said that kind of stuff can come back to bite you and it's just not a good way to be anyway, so.",
    "You were just trying to help.",
    "Hopefully they'll be able to see that.",
    "I'm going to erase out a little bit the shape of the bun.",
    "Just get that looking more interesting.",
    "And I think I will finally emerge this down to the background now.",
    "OK.",
    "We also can sketch in the Flowers, just roughly.",
    "I'm going to go with a.",
    "Warm yellow, green brownish yellow green.",
    "That's how I feel like they're looking.",
    "And I'm going to come back and work on these Flowers more.",
    "They're definitely not the important thing here.",
    "You can actually choose to leave them out if you wanted to focus on her face.",
    "If you're doing a study of her face and.",
    "That's just one thing too much.",
    "Taking up the time.",
    "Oh yeah, it's really not something you should feel bad about red.",
    "Hi Steven, thank you.",
    "Have you ever done any work with animals, cats, dogs, birds?",
    "Yes, not as frequently but I do.",
    "And uh.",
    "I wonder if I have any recent ones to share.",
    "I was recently painting a.",
    "Like a cat sleeping in the sunlight.",
    "We did a study like that, although the the painting was not so much about the cat.",
    "As like the whole scene kind of thing, but I do sometimes paint scenes with animals.",
    "It's just not most of the time, but I kind of want to do that more lately, like I've been trying to sort of refresh myself with painting.",
    "People with this stream and I hope they keep getting keep keep doing that.",
    "I want to paint some animals to just kind of keep in the groove with things like that.",
    "Um, guess the nurse is not easy to make your own brushes and which one just use most often.",
    "A good question.",
    "Well for today I'm using basically four brushes.",
    "This one.",
    "This one.",
    "This one and a smudge and all of these are in the brush pack, which you can download for free below the stream.",
    "In the description that one is a brushes that I have collected from other free brush packs over the years on the Internet.",
    "Also I have created some of the ones in that pack too, but it's just a collection overtime, but I also do make brushes and I've been.",
    "Work, I have one brush pack that's kind of already out that you can download and play with.",
    "It is for sale on artstation marketplace I'm on Gumroad.",
    "And.",
    "That one is linked below and description two.",
    "It's like a Ghibli inspired foliage and watercolor, gouache painting pack.",
    "An I'm working on and you brush pack right now.",
    "That's going to be finished soon and it's focused on traditional textures.",
    "So I do a little bit of both.",
    "Would be a little bit of both, but you can download the pack below stream.",
    "Hello Mother Mother ship thank you thank you, thank you Melina.",
    "Yeah, I'm trying to think I of the animals I've painted.",
    "I've painted a good amount of birds overtime.",
    "I find birds really fun to paint.",
    "The textures of the feathers and a lot of the feathers have like a reflective quality that I really like.",
    "And also you know they generally are in nice environments, and so I'm mainly environment painter nowadays I like to paint environments.",
    "Um, sometimes it can be nice to have little bird in the scene.",
    "You know something like that.",
    "It's just a little bit of extra.",
    "Life in the scene, but not a bunch of complication.",
    "Maybe like painting birds.",
    "So the early stages of getting color in a painting or always a bit rough.",
    "'cause you have alot of things looking flat.",
    "And kind of just have to.",
    "Trust the process and.",
    "Remember that you guys go through the ugly stage and then keep going.",
    "It doesn't usually take too long to get through that.",
    "But it takes a bit a little bit of discipline.",
    "Remind yourself.",
    "Oops.",
    "My pen is falling apart.",
    "I have not had that happen before.",
    "There we go.",
    "So I generally like to make a new layer and then paint for awhile on that layer and then merge down once.",
    "I am happy with whatever it was done there on that layer.",
    "Oh, thank you clearly.",
    "Thank you so much.",
    "I'm happy you like the brushes.",
    "Have you checked out Amy tans drawing of birds?",
    "I bet you love her attention to details.",
    "Wonderful thank you for the recommendation.",
    "I don't know that name.",
    "I'll stop in my head so I'm going to look them up.",
    "Woo yes, very detailed.",
    "That is so cool.",
    "Here let me show real quick so you guys can see what we're looking at.",
    "If I found the right person which I believe so is this, is this the one?",
    "I'm a big fan of botanical art like this.",
    "This is different than what I do, but I really enjoy it and it seems to take so much patience and.",
    "He had his patience and focus to make such clean rendering.",
    "Oh, you're welcome.",
    "And thank you.",
    "Yes, in area thank you.",
    "Oh no fish and what is?",
    "What did I say?",
    "The cat has never been satisfied with his portrait.",
    "That's funny.",
    "I think you're right, Bravo.",
    "It's impossible to capture the true grandeur of a cat.",
    "Probably the problem.",
    "Alright, so let's get the eyebrow in here, the eyebrows, the dreaded eyebrows that confused me so much during the sketch phase.",
    "Hopefully this will go better in the painting.",
    "Sometimes thinking and shapes of really is easier than lines, so I hope that will happen here.",
    "Oh, thank you.",
    "Yes, my little sock, you can make one of these very easily if anybody is watching you can cut a sock to wear as a drawing glove.",
    "So if you have any spares And he cleaned spares.",
    "It's very handy.",
    "Yeah, thanks for the recommendation, Jennifer.",
    "All without the Stylus.",
    "Oh sorry, fish him.",
    "Yeah I see now.",
    "There was a bit of a delay so I was wondering if it was because I mentioned that.",
    "I prefer drawing drawing birds to fish.",
    "I didn't know if I upset you.",
    "Just kidding, of course.",
    "Yeah, Luckily my stylus is not actually broken, just for some reason this front part came loose.",
    "I think I've been slowly unwinding it with my with my hand grip.",
    "So in the last painting what I did was I merged the.",
    "Sketch on to the painting and continued painting from there, with the sketch being part of the painting and eventually kind of getting painted over and I think it worked out pretty well workflow wise so maybe I will.",
    "Do that again.",
    "Thank you, Murph, Murph.",
    "It thank you very much.",
    "Well, I do a lot of studies and I do a lot of timed painting.",
    "Studies is not all about speed, but that did help me get faster like doing putting on timer for a couple hours or whatever at time I had or wanted to do for the study and just kind of doing the best I could during that time.",
    "I've done a lot of those kind of time studies over the past couple of years.",
    "OK, let's see.",
    "Ooh clever, let me see, let me see, let me see.",
    "Oh how cute.",
    "Oh my gosh guys, look at this.",
    "That is the cutest happiest little cat face I've ever seen.",
    "Oh my gosh, that's adorable.",
    "I think you're right.",
    "I think that cat is very satisfied with his portrait.",
    "Vision, I mean, just kidding.",
    "I never said that.",
    "Oh man, clever, thank you.",
    "That was wonderful.",
    "OK, what I'm going to do is duplicate the sketch layer so I can have it just as my leg safety net you buy.",
    "We might come back and need to overlay it.",
    "If I somehow get, I don't know if I go off on the tangent and I want to remember what my schedule is like, so I'll just leave a copy of it and then the duplicated version.",
    "What I'm going to do is erase everything I don't need.",
    "So basically everything related to the around the figure and stuff I think were good there.",
    "The issue is really the face.",
    "So.",
    "I'm going to merge that part down.",
    "And then we'll keep going from here.",
    "Oh well, thanks Kevin.",
    "I've gotten better at.",
    "Multi tasking, so I've been streaming for a few years now and so it's gotten better as I have gotten more practice talking and painting at the same time I will admit that.",
    "My focus isn't quite as good as it would be if I was just painting alone, but it is worth it.",
    "It is a lot is a lot of fun.",
    "It's a different experience and I love getting through.",
    "Have like feedback and chat with you guys and everything.",
    "It's definitely worth it.",
    "I still paint off stream and do that if I am like leading to 100% focus on something but.",
    "You know?",
    "That looks like my cat sunning herself so cute.",
    "Yes, I want to do more studies in my style like you do I don't know if you've seen lotion sketchbooks, but she also does such a great job at taking a reference in drawing it in her own style.",
    "Yes, jarisch, I have like I've been inspired by her a lot in that particular way.",
    "She has a few specifically.",
    "There's some sketches that she did up on some kind of summer vacation that she went on.",
    "There's like a whole series of them.",
    "And those in particular, I just absolutely love how she stylize them.",
    "I know exactly what you're talking about.",
    "I agree, and you can do it.",
    "You can do it, it just takes it like everything.",
    "It just takes practice and.",
    "You're probably not going to get the results that you like in the first few, but if you keep doing it, you will get there 100%.",
    "How long have you been digital painting about?",
    "Like almost Seven years like 6 1/2 going on Seven years?",
    "Now I've been doing digital painting.",
    "And before that I did traditional.",
    "Um, drawing, I didn't do much painting before this, so it was interesting as interesting transition for me from traditional to digital because it was a combination of transitioning from, you know.",
    "To a digital medium, but also my mindset going from drawing to painting, thinking of things in shapes and thinking about color.",
    "'cause all my drawings previously were like black and white.",
    "There's little exceptions here and there, but vast majority of what I was doing was black and white drawing.",
    "France says here's my quick warm up for work, but not really take.",
    "Oh cool.",
    "Check this out you guys.",
    "This is a pixel art rendition from Ryan in the chat.",
    "So cool.",
    "I love that.",
    "I absolutely love it.",
    "I am using a centriq.",
    "I have the Centriq 22 is the one I have.",
    "OK.",
    "And pixel art looks like so much fun.",
    "So I like that this is merged the background, because now I can just color pic from the background and paint over her skin and vice versa to try to fix this area.",
    "So there's light shining here, just looking at the planes of the face.",
    "I feel like her.",
    "Mouth Position.",
    "In some work still going to work on this part.",
    "Love Pixelart me too on my pixel Art Appreciator I'm not a pixel art creator yet.",
    "So maybe someday soon I'm very interested in dabbling in.",
    "It is just like.",
    "I haven't had time, but I really like it.",
    "So it's funny.",
    "'cause then the other.",
    "The other painting that I did earlier I had the issue of the lips being too close to the nose and this time I think I did the opposite.",
    "Need to move the lips up closer to the nose.",
    "Each person has a different shape and distance between.",
    "You know the features.",
    "So I'm trying to pay attention to that.",
    "I know Jackson.",
    "I'm having that too.",
    "So funny.",
    "Oh Do Pixar or my iPad pro?",
    "Isn't Andy and use a mouse rather than walk upstairs and grab it slowly?",
    "Hey, if it if it causes you to make this awesome pixel art then.",
    "I can't.",
    "I have nothing to say about it.",
    "Alright, so it looks like she's pursing her lips right now, but I want to make it look like her lips are slightly parted.",
    "I'm using a brush that's very hard to scale down to a detailed to detail work, so I might end up switching brushes, but I'm trying to use this one as long as I can 'cause.",
    "I think it keeps my painting feeling fresh when I use a bigger.",
    "Bigger brush I know that might not make sense.",
    "'cause I'm my brushes kind of I'm scaling it down as much as I can for this brush.",
    "But try not to go down to it through it, even smaller one.",
    "If you ever have trouble with that kind of stuff, like if you get sucked into do details too soon, my tips are.",
    "To use a big chunky brush, stay zoomed out.",
    "As much as possible, staying zoomed out is probably the biggest tip.",
    "I mean, I'm a little bit zoomed in right now, but this is like as close as I want to get until we get into much more later phase in that painting.",
    "Alright, I'm going to pay attention to the neck too.",
    "Because I have the tendency to ignore.",
    "The later and then.",
    "Oh yeah.",
    "Was interested in face painting, the facial features and not so interested in the.",
    "The neck and and that stuff.",
    "Going to grab an airbrush because this area has a lot of very soft curves like the neck here is not a hard edge.",
    "I think that I think the Airbrush will be helpful.",
    "There's a very soft rounded edge to her draw.",
    "And there's a bit of bounce light which I have friends addressed yet, but she is going to have some within the shadows.",
    "She's going to have some warm light bouncing.",
    "It looks probably off the dress on to her.",
    "So making a selection for the.",
    "Collar bone.",
    "And just filling in with the airbrush.",
    "So I really like using the lasso tool airbrush combo to paint in areas, especially when they have a hard and soft edge.",
    "And then I just use the smudge brush to blur out.",
    "Any edges that remained little bit too sharp.",
    "So that dress.",
    "More like this.",
    "I see.",
    "Oh goodnight, Tesla.",
    "Thanks for hanging out sweet dreams.",
    "See next time.",
    "Kevin says I did my first digital sketch of lady in the tramp last year for a project.",
    "That work could be good to get your thoughts, let's take a peek here.",
    "Oh wow, what did you use for this?",
    "That is amazing that this is a painting.",
    "It almost looks like it's a photo of like.",
    "Or a?",
    "A 3D model, it looks very 3 dimensional.",
    "It looks like it could be like a plushy toy or something like that.",
    "Like it's very, very 3D.",
    "The way the shading is under here and the texture of the fur.",
    "That's so cool.",
    "Yeah, it really looks like it could be a like a product like a 3D.",
    "Like a toy or something.",
    "A lot of patience with those textures.",
    "So the Flowers are casting a shadow onto her.",
    "Just a little bit.",
    "There's not a very hard light source in this painting is all pretty soft alright.",
    "Painting in the in the in the photo.",
    "But There still is a shadow.",
    "Oops, while those not the color, I thought I had colored hip Superintendent.",
    "OK, so I've been painting for quite awhile on normal layer, but I do like to use layer blending modes.",
    "And.",
    "Let me see I think the chat is moving a bit fast, see.",
    "Uhm yeah, scenario says.",
    "I'm drawing only my PC.",
    "Oh, since he's 24 HD touch, but that's.",
    "That's a very nice.",
    "Tablet.",
    "I have an iPod and I also have the welcomes antique.",
    "Yes narian.",
    "I prefer painting on the centriq.",
    "I feel more secure with my set up.",
    "iPad is nice for like going out and sketching on the go kind of thing and I know a lot of people.",
    "A lot of artists that use it as their main set up an feel comfortable with that.",
    "I think part of the issue with me is that it's knew tamilan.",
    "I'm much more familiar with painting on the Santee 'cause I've been doing this for like almost Seven years now and the.",
    "IPad I only got a few months ago.",
    "So maybe I'm very biased towards the Centriq 'cause I'm so much more comfortable with it.",
    "But I personally prefer it.",
    "I prefer those in peak if I'm going to do polished work, I like to sit at my desk and have my setup very secure like the iPad.",
    "I don't have a stand for it as well, so it's not a fair comparison, but that's just my personal experience.",
    "Um?",
    "Fish and says any plans to do a character in landscape peace in the pipeline, kind of like you did in the past before you started to do the landscape studies with your new style.",
    "I would like to explore that yes Fish and so the last stream that I did hear I actually did have it was from reference so I wasn't necessarily creating a unique composition, but I did paint a woman in a environment and I haven't finished it yet.",
    "It was nearly finished at the end of stream, but I wanted to tweak it a little bit more and clean it up and.",
    "You know, add some things and stuff like that.",
    "I wonder if I can pull it up real quick to show.",
    "Woman with branch.",
    "That was the.",
    "That was that.",
    "That was the there was a woman holding a big branch and I.",
    "We changed it to Flowers in my version, so this is a very even though it is a natural.",
    "I mean it is a background.",
    "It's very abstracted and this one is still unfinished, but.",
    "I do want to get more into combining them, but.",
    "It's going to be probably at a slow pace here in there doing it.",
    "Um?",
    "I don't have any particular project that's like sort of throwing the into doing this right away, but it's something I do want to work towards, so we'll be doing more of that here in there.",
    "Um, about Seven years are of about Seven years for painting.",
    "But before that I did a lot of drawing like basically my whole life.",
    "I've been interested in art and drawing, so since I was a kid.",
    "I was drawing and then.",
    "Got into painting later on.",
    "Oh wow, no way Kevin, that's so cool.",
    "Got moved on to plush toy design.",
    "Guy asked to create plush toy for Disney, that's awesome, congratulations.",
    "Holy cow, yeah, it looks.",
    "It looks really well.",
    "That's perfect for based on what you used it for.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Crazy, right?",
    "I always made my paintings that are there like named as if their stock photos.",
    "So for me.",
    "Woman with branch woman with red dress.",
    "And Flowers.",
    "I can't, I can't.",
    "I can't come up with creative names for my paintings.",
    "I have to save all that energy for the painting.",
    "I have none left for titles.",
    "Oh, you're welcome.",
    "You're welcome, necessary.",
    "OK, so.",
    "What can we do next?",
    "So yeah, I was talking about layer blending modes, so I'm going to make a new layer and put it on overlay because I want to like bump up the color on the dress a little bit.",
    "An overlay is very intense.",
    "With the saturating I don't know if this is going to be too much.",
    "But I like to use overlay if I want to give like some subsurface scattering to the skin or just kind of saturate a little bit more so.",
    "Let's try that.",
    "I'm using an airbrush and I'm going to go very carefully to not over do it, but I'm going to add a little bit of legwork blush just to make it look like there's some warmth in life in her face and skin.",
    "Now, ideally, I would have picked the perfect colors when I was painting maybe, and I wouldn't have to add this, but it's wonderful to have these tools.",
    "I love that that's one thing I really, really love about digital when we talk about.",
    "Different things, digital and traditional.",
    "I love that I can just come here and.",
    "Sort of add almost a filter over what I've already painted without having to redo things.",
    "I can add this little bit of extra color.",
    "Hi Marianna.",
    "Welcome.",
    "Yes, so if you want to watch the stream later, usually just takes a couple hours after the end of stream for it to process and then the video will be available again to re watch if you visit my page.",
    "And go to videos tab.",
    "You'll find all the past streams are there, and as far as the paintings I'm working on, I usually post them.",
    "Either he ran be hands or on my Instagram.",
    "Sometimes I most of the time I just post my favourites on be hands.",
    "I want to post my better work here, but I sometimes I'll post other things on Instagram that are a little bit less polished but still want to share.",
    "Let's declares, he says.",
    "You need to start naming those like on the wish flower shop website.",
    "Oh my gosh, that's hilarious.",
    "You guys, women with capital letters, red dress wearing red, holding Flowers, yellow Flowers.",
    "Oh my gosh, I need to at least name one painting in that format.",
    "It's hilarious.",
    "My last painting is called badly painted young Russian woman Steven.",
    "Oh, I'm sure it's not badly painted, but that's also kind of adorable.",
    "I like it.",
    "There's a sense of humor there.",
    "Alright, well I think I'm I'm trying not to over saturate too much.",
    "This red 'cause we could easily get there.",
    "There's another way we can address this too so I'm going to lower the opacity, emerge that down.",
    "We can also use adjustment layers so on the bottom of my layers palette I can select the little half circle icon here.",
    "Let me just move this over so you can see 'cause I think my camera is blocking it.",
    "Let's try again.",
    "There you go.",
    "So yeah, click this button here and then we can go to select selective color.",
    "And then choose a Reds.",
    "And we can.",
    "Just edit basically the red things in the painting is not wild.",
    "I love selective color.",
    "I usually don't use this until the end of a painting and then I'll go in and change some things around or tweak things.",
    "But it's so powerful.",
    "Like you don't have to make any selections or anything, you can just.",
    "Go through these sliders and.",
    "Have a ton of.",
    "Freedom and you can mask things out so.",
    "Here's the here's what I did.",
    "If I don't want that effect in certain areas, but I do want to others, I can just click on this square here and then take my airbrush or whatever brush you want to use.",
    "If you paint with black, it will mask away that effect.",
    "So maybe I want it to be darker down here, less red.",
    "And then.",
    "Anywhere that you want to get rid of that.",
    "If you think it's doing too much, you can just erase away and then if you go back with white then it will come back.",
    "So yeah, but you can keep this separate.",
    "It's a very non destructive way to do these edits because you can always come back.",
    "I just wanted to show how to do that.",
    "I don't mind it being part of the paintings, I'll just merge it in but.",
    "Yes, very very handy.",
    "Get back over here layers.",
    "OK.",
    "Oh, thank you.",
    "Thank you.",
    "I'm glad you like my rendition of her.",
    "I'm going to try a little bit of color Dodge for fun here.",
    "I'm going to do the same effect as earlier, so I'm going to double click on the layer an unchecked transparency shapes layer, and then I'm going to put my layer blending mode on color, Dodge the light that's coming into this room seems a little bit.",
    "Cold like it doesn't seem like a warm late in the day evening light.",
    "You know it seems like a very bright light.",
    "Like a like a white white.",
    "Just how I'm reading it so.",
    "If I'm going to add a little bit of light shining on her, for example with the again with the airbrush, want to add these big.",
    "Lighting effects I kind of like to use the.",
    "The Airbrush Just tap a little bit.",
    "I think that's a bit better.",
    "And we have to move that down so.",
    "This is before and after some extra lighting, so depending on the person you might like the first version better.",
    "There's different taste.",
    "Some people are kind of a first.",
    "The look at the layer blending modes give I personally like it and what I usually do is paint over it after that.",
    "So if you find that color Dodge or overlay over exposed or something and you can usually paint that out or just paint over it and blend in like with a couple brushstrokes, it's pretty easy to do and there's so there so helpful.",
    "So I used them plenty.",
    "Steven says, Oh, Is It?",
    "And artwork.",
    "Is that something for a populist to see?",
    "Oh, is this your painting that we painted young Russian woman?",
    "What is that in Frisco?",
    "The textures are cool though the textures on the body the you can see the paint strokes.",
    "Oh, thank you.",
    "Thank you Kevin.",
    "So I'm going to add a little bit of.",
    "Cooler light reflecting on the skin here something a little bit more towards blue blueish white, similar to the color of the wall up here that would make sense.",
    "'cause That's kind of light.",
    "Causing this reflection.",
    "Of course you can take artistic license and change this stuff, but usually if I'm doing this study then I'm going to try to say pretty close to the reference picture, 'cause I'm trying to learn something from that.",
    "I don't want to get too.",
    "Crazy.",
    "'cause then I'm just kind of.",
    "Then I'm doing something different then that's a personal exploration which is also very good to do.",
    "Good for your art.",
    "Good for fun, but it's not as much of a study if you are.",
    "Just kind of inventing all the.",
    "The lighting and everything.",
    "Although there could be different things that you're studying, it could be studying.",
    "Well, any number of things, but for me I'm focusing on learning about the lighting in the original.",
    "So yes, fresco, super cool.",
    "Alright, we'll get a little hint of the nostril there.",
    "There's like so many variables that are new at one time that it's more difficult, and you kind of really have to stick to the reference like we're saying.",
    "But then as you study more and more and you start to like, learn how things work, then you will have more freedom because you don't.",
    "You don't have to try to split your focus in so many different ways, there's.",
    "A few things that will start becoming like second major.",
    "You'll just kind of understand how they work and then you can experiment more.",
    "You'll feel the freedom to experiment more so.",
    "That will definitely happen.",
    "And I still have a lot to learn.",
    "I'm definitely feeling at it.",
    "As you see the progress and it can be helpful for giving you that push to like.",
    "Keep going with it.",
    "But it's also just an on going.",
    "Journey like we're we're always going to be.",
    "You know, even artists that are.",
    "Have been doing art and painting for decades and decades I I'm sure they feel the same way too in there.",
    "Always learning something new.",
    "I'm putting trying to put a little bit of that warm bounce light under the chin.",
    "Still not happy with that.",
    "But we'll get there bringing the airbrush to soften things a bit.",
    "So I'm going to bring the chin out a little bit more.",
    "A little bit better, but.",
    "Seems to be a little bit more like.",
    "Here.",
    "Why he flips the study.",
    "So I flip it to get a fresh view, flipping it, kind of.",
    "And when you been looking at a scene for awhile from one angle, you tend to like.",
    "You stop being able to see mistakes as easily and when you flip it, your brain kind of gets a fresh look at it.",
    "And you might notice that something is slanted, weird or something like that.",
    "Oh, you're welcome Jen.",
    "I'm happy that it helps.",
    "I've been.",
    "Yeah, I know that sometimes I'm flipping a lot, so I apologize if it's ever annoying to watch, but I've become so.",
    "Used to doing that and comfortable with doing that.",
    "It really really helps me and I sometimes do without even thinking.",
    "Hey Andy, good to see you.",
    "I'll think you drop.",
    "Thanks for being here.",
    "You guys, I hope you're having a good day so far.",
    "For anybody who's just coming in, I can show you the portrait we did right before this one.",
    "Um?",
    "This one was about 2 hours.",
    "And.",
    "The one we're working on right now I'm my goal is to spend about two to three hours on it.",
    "It's a bit harder actually, because of the side view.",
    "But I'm enjoying it.",
    "That random but nice chair haha.",
    "Thank you, Yeah, but the cherry have is a Noble chairs.",
    "It's the.",
    "The Epic Gaming Chair is the name of it.",
    "If you wanted to look it up.",
    "It's a good chair if you spend a ton of time at your desk and everything.",
    "It can be nice to have a supportive chair.",
    "I had some really rough chairs before this one.",
    "I was happy to upgrade.",
    "Oh, thank you Kevin.",
    "We're getting we're getting there.",
    "We're getting there with the.",
    "With the mouth and the.",
    "Sachin.",
    "That was the.",
    "Unexpectedly tricky part.",
    "I guess the chin just came out a little further than than I thought.",
    "Hi Jane Welcome.",
    "So the red of the lipstick and the dress in my image is a little bit more of a like tomato red.",
    "The reference is has a little bit more towards magenta almost.",
    "I mean it's still red, it's not.",
    "But you know what I mean?",
    "I think mines Amore towards yellow rather than blue.",
    "And I think that's OK.",
    "Feels.",
    "Feels good, I think.",
    "We could huge shift it to be more magenta.",
    "But I think I like it.",
    "Thank you Stephanie.",
    "Yeah, it's been fun to do some portraits again, I was talking about this earlier, but the reason I started I got into doing portraits today.",
    "There was a couple of things.",
    "One I've had a lot of questions lately.",
    "Since I do mostly landscapes, I've had a few questions asking if I would do some portraits.",
    "So I had it in mind for awhile, but I wanted to do some and last night I took a little bit of time when I was sketching around with that Sailor Moon redraw meme.",
    "That's been going around, but the screen screenshot.",
    "Um?",
    "Everyone, so it's been going around on Twitter.",
    "I think that's where I saw it.",
    "People have been repainting a screenshot from one of the old Sailor Moon episodes, and it's cool to see.",
    "Like a lot of different style, a lot of different art styles, people doing the same screenshot in different ways.",
    "So anyway, I was kind of diddling around with that, and it's the first time that I've been painting a character in quite some time.",
    "And then it got me in the mood to paint portraits.",
    "so I thought we would do this.",
    "But if you guys enjoy this, we can do more often portraits mixed in with the landscape.",
    "Maybe we can do some animals.",
    "There is a place in my discord where you can suggest topics and reference images of things that you might like to see in the streams.",
    "So if you're interested in joining my discord community, there's a link below the stream in the description.",
    "And there's a channel in there that's just called suggest topics I think, and you can post in there things that you'd like to see.",
    "Yes, Jay and I am I am using a Wakeham Centriq 22 so I have a little.",
    "I have a stylist and I'm drawing on the screen.",
    "But for anyone who is looking to get into digital painting, there's a lot of.",
    "There's a lot of different tablets available.",
    "You don't need to go right in and get a screen tablet right off the bat.",
    "It's art club open to all.",
    "Yes, anybody can join in for our club and do the studies along with us.",
    "Art Club is that we're doing in an ongoing study group in the discord as well, where there's a new topic every couple weeks, everyone is welcome to join in on that.",
    "Show us all about the Sailor Moon thing I, I promise I will, but it's like.",
    "It's not really far enough along.",
    "Well, I can show you, but it's like such a work in progress, it's still.",
    "It's not what it's what I want to do with it eventually, but.",
    "Oh no, that's the.",
    "That's the sketch I did here.",
    "Let me see if I can open the painting.",
    "But I started it and then I was thinking that I actually might try a different style.",
    "I don't know.",
    "I feel like I want to paint this screenshot and like a couple of different styles.",
    "Um?",
    "Am I not able to find?",
    "Oh here we go.",
    "So this is the.",
    "This is the screen I can show you the screenshots here, but this is my work in progress.",
    "At the moment.",
    "So she has this intense expression which I was trying to get, and it's actually really tricky.",
    "But this is the screen shot of her.",
    "So everyone, a lot of people are getting all this.",
    "It's really fun if you guys want to join in draw Sailor Moon.",
    "If you Google Sammy and redraw, I think you're going to find it.",
    "Oh that's OK.",
    "Yeah scenario I don't mind at all.",
    "You're doing great.",
    "Jane, every Wednesday I'll be here every Wednesday.",
    "And thank you project.",
    "Good to see you.",
    "Yeah, I'm thinking of.",
    "So I guess the thing I couldn't decide on with the.",
    "The repaint that I was doing is how much of an anime?",
    "How much of an anime vibe to take with it?",
    "Like do I should I re imagine her more as like a real person?",
    "Should I keep the anime eyes like I just couldn't decide what to do with it?",
    "Oh is very Val doing more in German?",
    "It's not related to it's not related to hers, but that's cool.",
    "I would love to see that.",
    "Yeah, so Jane, it's every Wednesday an I start.",
    "Let's see what time it is.",
    "About 3 1/2 hours ago is when I started and yeah it's the same time every week.",
    "Really.",
    "All thanks you guys.",
    "I know this little bit of delay and I'm seeing all your reactions to the Sailor Moon picture right now.",
    "OK, maybe I won't restart it then.",
    "I was feeling very.",
    "I worked on it for awhile last night and you know how when you paint something for a few hours and you're just like not sure what it even looks like anymore.",
    "I can't remember exactly how long I spent on that, but I think it was like.",
    "Maybe 2 to three hours last night and afterwards.",
    "I was just like I don't know.",
    "Is it doesn't need more animate less anime.",
    "Anyway, thank you so much you guys.",
    "I appreciate that.",
    "I'll keep going with it then.",
    "So currently in art club were studying ears, so I have to do a good job on this.",
    "Here you guys I can't cop out on it because that would be ridiculous.",
    "That's literally what we're studying right now.",
    "I have to do a good ear.",
    "This is a perfect example of a portrait where it's worthwhile to spend some time on the year.",
    "Claire sees as they once tried to draw a chrollo from Hunter Hunter X Hunter in a realistic way rather than anime found it so difficult it is it is I found the same thing with some video game characters.",
    "If the original model of the character is like.",
    "Not like a real person.",
    "It's more of stylized.",
    "It's hard to.",
    "Take that into a realistic or semi realistic.",
    "It's really tough challenge.",
    "Looks like she came to life and is ready to be a superhero.",
    "Nice, thank you.",
    "That's awesome.",
    "Thanks Sarah.",
    "Oh cool, I have to check that out, Jennifer.",
    "Of the check that I've been really enjoying seeing peoples versions in the different styles.",
    "And some of them are a bit funny.",
    "Oh my gosh, have you guys seen the silly ones?",
    "I mean, I've seen all kinds of stuff.",
    "I mean, it's really funny people have put like a shark face like she's a shark.",
    "Or like I've seen people draw all kinds of weird stuff just with her hair, basically turning it into Sailor Moon.",
    "and I mean, I know I'm easily amused.",
    "But it's really funny.",
    "I definitely advise appraising the Sailor Moon redraw hashtag for some laughs.",
    "And some very good art as well.",
    "But definitely less people being silly.",
    "I haven't Jane.",
    "I haven't used fresco yet.",
    "I do think it looks pretty cool.",
    "Some of the textures are awesome, but Photoshop is my.",
    "Main program.",
    "Yeah, I don't know if I improve the ear.",
    "Think I will erase out this area up here.",
    "I kind of like my first version.",
    "See This is why I like to work on a separate layer sometimes.",
    "Sadly, you don't always improve.",
    "Sometimes, sometimes when you're painting, you make a couple of Brushstrokes.",
    "It's kind of taking the painting in the wrong direction.",
    "And I really like being able to turn the layer on and off.",
    "Be like do I like that and then decide if I want to merge it down?",
    "You find Nigel Thornberry.",
    "I didn't see that one particular.",
    "It was really funny.",
    "I didn't see that you saw one with Christine.",
    "Always loved routine.",
    "How cute.",
    "He asking some real silly ones, that's awesome.",
    "It's been going on for awhile, I think.",
    "Which is cool I have like I was saying earlier, it's been awhile since I've gotten to jump in on one of these memes.",
    "They've been a few of the.",
    "Sort of come and gone, and I just didn't get a chance to jump in.",
    "This one was Sailor Moon so.",
    "He couldn't miss it.",
    "There you go.",
    "OK, I see.",
    "Am I going to be scarred?",
    "Oh my God.",
    "This is what I'm talking about.",
    "It's so funny what people are doing OK.",
    "Here you go.",
    "I hope this brings joy to people, yes.",
    "Success.",
    "Clever says fresco just got some new features.",
    "I saw them yesterday.",
    "Can't wait to try blender brushes woo blender brushes.",
    "What is that?",
    "It sounds like mixer brush.",
    "I like the sound of that.",
    "Why is it a challenge?",
    "Well, I think they're saying challenge just because they're like challenging people to do it.",
    "But yeah, I think you're right that the expression is a little bit tough because she's like, it's like she has multiple.",
    "Emotions at one time like it's a very cool shot.",
    "It's a very cool capture.",
    "Like her expression I think is very well done by the animators there.",
    "But I think the challenges is just to do it like for example to draw this in your style challenge or whatever.",
    "It's just I think the challenge thing is more to do with the fact that their challenging people to do their version of it kind of thing like that's how I how I kind of read it.",
    "But I've seen people comment on the expression and when I was working on mine last night, I was like, yeah, this is a tricky one.",
    "Not everyone is feeling the need to.",
    "Do the expression exactly the way it is in the the reference.",
    "Either some people are just doing their own thing kind of putting in a similar pose.",
    "So I think it's just for fun, so it's all good.",
    "Oh, thank you, yes, and are you.",
    "Thank you.",
    "The 3D Ness of your Sailor Moon painting reminds me of a great article on Instagram.",
    "Wow, cool, thank you Jackson.",
    "Maybe maybe you can send me that artist if you think of it.",
    "I would like to check out their work maybe firstly inspiration if you can find them.",
    "Yeah, half the time I can remember people and then I can't remember their name on socials.",
    "I know the rendering is like really good on that natural Thornberry feel like what?",
    "OK, so let's take a step back here.",
    "As much as I'm enjoying working on the character or the person, the woman I feel like soon I should take a look at these Flowers.",
    "Otherwise we're going to end up with.",
    "These Nothing going on here by the end and that I do think we need to do something with the Flowers to make this scene feel complete or just take them away and not have her holding Flowers, but we can't leave him out there now.",
    "OK, here's another one you guys this is.",
    "Thank you.",
    "You're a.",
    "So this is the one with Pooh Sheen.",
    "Oh, not gonna lie, hurt my own feelings drawing that single pier pushy.",
    "How cute.",
    "OK, those are great.",
    "Thanks you guys.",
    "I appreciate the links I hadn't seen either of those.",
    "So thank you.",
    "My day is improved.",
    "So I'm going to.",
    "I've been saving some of the previous versions as we go through here, so it's kind of cool to see the progression.",
    "Almost like the lights got turned on.",
    "I I didn't really do that with the previous painting, but.",
    "There's always the video.",
    "There's always the stream video.",
    "We can go back and see it that way.",
    "Alright, I'm going to take the Airbrush.",
    "I want a little bit more of a rounded look to her neck.",
    "Back here, so we're just going to.",
    "Do some shading.",
    "Trying to pick the right color.",
    "I want a darker Brown.",
    "Something like that.",
    "I would just merge this away.",
    "Make a selection here.",
    "And we can do the same thing on the red dress too.",
    "Like there's a little bit of shading up here.",
    "Over here.",
    "But we do see like some stitching.",
    "The catch is the lights kind of a cool detail.",
    "Thank you, fission.",
    "Thank you, feels nice to draw people again.",
    "Let's put some little wrinkles.",
    "So we need a little bit of darker values.",
    "Here I'm address in shadow.",
    "To make more balanced feeling overall to the shading so like something was missing.",
    "There we go.",
    "Thank you, thank you.",
    "Appreciate that, although the cat version is very good, very good.",
    "So some wrinkles.",
    "Luckily, the fabric is pretty smooth.",
    "My favorite type of fabric to paint on people is.",
    "Fairly fitted or clingy fabric with just a little bit of wrinkles, but I think that's the easiest because.",
    "And I think it looks nice because you get a nice view of the form of the person's body.",
    "And then you know, a little bit of wrinkling here and there, but it's not.",
    "I prefer this to like drawing baggy clothes.",
    "Something like that is really hard.",
    "We did one on this stream awhile back.",
    "You could watch the video of it if you go to the my page and look at the past videos, but we painted a girl wearing a big baggy sweatshirt and that sweater I should say and that one was really tough.",
    "How to wrinkles?",
    "So.",
    "This kind of clothing is a little nicer too.",
    "The painting.",
    "OK, I think it's time to paint some details on the Flowers.",
    "So what can we do here?",
    "Let's look at the darks and lights first so I want to add some darker shadows in between the groups of Flowers.",
    "So there Skype OK.",
    "They're kind of clustered together, and so we get some darker greens.",
    "This.",
    "And she's holding the Flowers close to her body, so there's darker shading on the dress down here too.",
    "Just do that.",
    "If you guys are hearing a lot of clicking.",
    "That is my keyboard.",
    "I use the keyboard for shortcuts, and I've reassigned um any of the default.",
    "To my left hand, like some of them were already.",
    "Just naturally keys that you hit with the left hand, but anything that was.",
    "Any shortcuts that were originally on the right side of the keyboard.",
    "I've just resigned them all so that I can draw with the Stylus in my right hand and just click the keys in my left hand.",
    "There's all different ways to set this stuff up.",
    "Some people like to use.",
    "Like tablet buttons on the tablet or other kinds of shortcuts, but.",
    "I like the keyboard.",
    "I feel like it's.",
    "When I first started out, I liked the keyboard 'cause I already knew some shortcuts and I didn't have.",
    "That was sort of easy to just start using those right away, like for example just using undo, copy, paste, transform things that you might know generally, and so I could start right away using those with the keyboard.",
    "And also.",
    "The keyboard is mostly going to stay the same, so that's another thing I like using the keyboard shortcuts, I feel like with the tablets sometimes the models will change and they will get rid of buttons or put buttons in different places and stuff and always hated the idea of having to relearn all my shortcuts just because.",
    "There was a different type of tablet now.",
    "So the keyboard is pretty stable.",
    "As far as I don't think they're going to change where the keys are.",
    "So if I memorize the keyboard shortcuts, then I'm good to go.",
    "Don't have to change them.",
    "All right, so we've got some stems for the Flowers.",
    "Oh, thank you.",
    "You are a.",
    "Yeah, so when I first started doing these studies without choosing from the color Picker, I did find it very frustrating and I felt a bit slower at 1st and my colors were often a bit off, but I would say within like two to three months of doing paintings without color picking it started to get a lot easier.",
    "I would say for anybody who like feels restricted when I first got into digital painting, I only ever color picked from photos like I never painted without the color Picker.",
    "But Yeah, I work through that by doing these studies.",
    "Practicing by just looking at the color and so I do.",
    "Sometimes, you know, change things a little bit by making mistakes or by like my own preferences coming in.",
    "But Thank you.",
    "Um, do you have to keep changing color by keyboard?",
    "So what you do what you can do is if you have your paintbrush selected like this.",
    "Um?",
    "If I hold alt, it brings up the color picker, the eyedropper so I can, for example color pic here, like if I'm blending something.",
    "This is often how I blend is like.",
    "Let's say I want to blend this Brown and the red, so I'll color pic from here and just overlap.",
    "And colour pick an overlap in color.",
    "Pick an overlap and just do that until you get a gradient like that.",
    "Use the buttons on my tablet.",
    "Most of the time.",
    "Don't know how managed before, right?",
    "Just going through the menus every time there's a few, there's a few short cut, but I still need to add to my workflow like there's there's a few things I still do like the long way that I should probably address.",
    "But you know how it is you kind of have to take a when you're trying to memorize new shortcuts.",
    "It always feels like you have to be slower at first while you're going through the memorization stage.",
    "You know it's easier to just go to the menu, you know where it is.",
    "You can get it done, but then you're thinking like, oh, what did I sign this?",
    "And you have to.",
    "It's kind of annoying at first, but it's so worth it.",
    "There's a few more I need to start doing that with.",
    "Do you ever find yourself using what you know in your head is probably the the wrong color.",
    "How to get out of that headspace?",
    "Um, trying to think of what usually trips me up with this stuff with color picking.",
    "Um?",
    "I don't know that I've had that exact kind of feeling.",
    "What you're talking about.",
    "Usually my problem is like I don't know it's the wrong color.",
    "I like think it's the right color, but then some things just feels wrong about it and then, So what I'll usually do is try to paint without color picking.",
    "But if something just keeps feeling wrong then I will go and color pic NC like where am I in relationship to the reference?",
    "Like for example I know that I didn't get the same color for her dress, but I kind of like this tomato.",
    "Read a little bit more.",
    "It's like more yellow we read then.",
    "Magenta, red, and we're talking about that, so I kind of like it.",
    "But let's say I really wanted it to be exactly like this, so I would just go over here and grab it and so what's nice about doing this is you can see where you're off.",
    "An maybe helps for the future, so like for me, I'd be curious how.",
    "What is the color of this shine here?",
    "OK, so we can see where that is and then if we color pic on mine.",
    "We can see that minds a bit darker.",
    "Anna bit too warm so that I can learn what I did wrong that it needs to be lighter and cooler, less saturated, and so that's what I'll do is if I feel like something just looks wrong or I don't get it, I'll dig, try to get the right color, but if I can't, or if I want to check like check my work, I can do that.",
    "But here's one more tip about the colour picking.",
    "You see how there's all these like pixelation to the images?",
    "I mean when you zoom in, look at this.",
    "I mean you can color pic from this area and who knows what you're going to get any of these colors could be the one you get and they are really different from each other.",
    "So if you're going to color pic from a photo, you might want to go to filter noise, median, or or any kind of blur filter will work.",
    "But I like to use median if I'm going to do this and it really makes it easier to get to color pic and feel like you're getting a representation of that area and not getting a or actually know what someone told me recently.",
    "I think this may have been Jackson.",
    "Someone told me recently.",
    "That you can come on your color Picker.",
    "Let's see if you can change the point sample to average pixel, so this will do the same thing, only you don't get the visual of it, but it's doing it anyway I guess.",
    "So when your color picking, it's going to take an average of however many pixels you say here 51 pixels, though I guess 51 pixels around your.",
    "Where you color pic is going to average those and give you the color.",
    "I don't know what that will do on edges.",
    "But I guess if you color pic right in the middle of stuff, that should do it.",
    "Or go to a smaller average number.",
    "But that should also do it, but the point is, you don't want to get these random little pixelated things.",
    "And colour, so that's why sometimes color picking is like not as easy as people think either.",
    "'cause you could be coloured picking from photo an getting like really weird stuff from it, not realizing that you picked like off pixel like a weird pixel.",
    "Have you been painting digitally for along about Seven years now is when I started.",
    "Have you considered adding a posterized layer to reduce the colors?",
    "I played with some like layer and filter effects like that just for just for fun.",
    "But I guess I'm not a huge fan.",
    "Of the aesthetic, like I haven't been able to work anything like that into my style in a way that I like.",
    "I think I think for more stylized art that would be really cool, but generally the way I paint I feel like it doesn't work so well.",
    "Oh, you're welcome, clearly.",
    "ASI We have an art share here.",
    "Jackson says my take on this one.",
    "I like it better than the first one I did today.",
    "Woo, pretty textures.",
    "I like your last edges and stuff that is super cool.",
    "See if I consume in here.",
    "Yeah, I sent some mixer brush use in this.",
    "I really like these edges.",
    "Very pretty portrait.",
    "Like it's a beautiful portrait, but I'm interested in your brushwork.",
    "It looks really good.",
    "Nicely done that fast too.",
    "OK, so.",
    "Let me see what time it is 'cause I wanted to take a look in budget.",
    "My time finishing this up.",
    "Alright, we're doing pretty well.",
    "So I should be able to finish this one, but looking at Jackson's painting.",
    "It makes me want to take some of these edges and really soften them.",
    "I really, really liked what you did.",
    "Of course, we're doing a bit of a different style.",
    "In our painting, oh, that was the wrong tool.",
    "But I do like the idea of letting the edges be a little softer as they are not not close the face, but you know the other around the other edges of painting.",
    "Did it mean the post raise layer for the artwork?",
    "Not for the aesthetic but for the color picking on the reference?",
    "Stephanie, I get what you mean.",
    "I probably should have realized that yeah, yeah, yeah, I get what you mean.",
    "I haven't tried that.",
    "That would probably work too though.",
    "That would probably work too, 'cause it would give you a flat area of color to use the color Picker on.",
    "So yeah.",
    "Lots of mixer brush on the slide.",
    "Good stuff.",
    "Well, it looks awesome.",
    "Oh yeah, I said I was going to paint the Flowers, but I haven't really been doing that.",
    "Let's keep going on the Flowers like I start working on the Flowers and I'm like so boring.",
    "Let's paint her, but I do like painting Flowers.",
    "But I gotta figure out a way to simplify these Flowers because it it seems like a lot of detail.",
    "If we really get into it.",
    "So let's see what we can do.",
    "Want to kind of sort of cluster them up.",
    "And focus on the overall shape of the bouquet and.",
    "The overall just impression that you get from looking at them.",
    "But not so much every single flower.",
    "We don't need to render every flower.",
    "So I'm looking at overall what the shading looks like on the Flowers as a big group.",
    "And then I want to also look at more individual Flowers.",
    "So for example, say there's one over here.",
    "I went over here in here.",
    "Here, here.",
    "They have these little darker centers.",
    "Here dude, I'm just putting these wherever I want.",
    "I mean I'm looking at the reference but not painting all the Flowers exactly where they are in the reference.",
    "That would be how we be here long time.",
    "Stephanie says it's awesome.",
    "You get a slider on the posterize layer that let's you choose the amount of colors you want to have.",
    "Pretty neat for building up a pallet off a picture.",
    "Thank you for the thank you for the suggestion looking inside, so I think that would probably be super nifty in pixel art stuff too, huh?",
    "I like that I'll probably use that if I get stuck.",
    "Something.",
    "So you guys can probably tell, but this brush is really hard to do detailed things on.",
    "It's not really so possible.",
    "Hey Janice, How do you render in photo shop?",
    "Well, you just take a a blank canvas and I use any of these brushes here.",
    "There's default brushes in Photoshop or you can install separate ones and then you just paint on the canvas.",
    "You can use layers, there's tons of different things you can use.",
    "I don't know if I'm answering the right question when you said render.",
    "If you mean something else.",
    "Let me know do you mean like save the saving it out and exporting it?",
    "But either way I always every Wednesday I'm here.",
    "You know streaming my my painting process, my illustrating so you're always welcome to come here and watch the process.",
    "and I go through the whole.",
    "Picture.",
    "All welcome back, Murphy hey, you can always watch the video later if you want.",
    "The nice thing about watching the past streams here on Behance is that there's this tool timeline tool which is really neat.",
    "This is a plugin that I'm using and it's recording the tools.",
    "I'm using the brushes amusing as I'm using it.",
    "So, uhm.",
    "Yeah I was.",
    "Yeah, so you can.",
    "See in more detail if it's if it's easier.",
    "If it's hard to follow along for any reason, then watching the past streams later can give you more info.",
    "Yeah, Yeah, Stephanie, that's what I was thinking about like.",
    "I see how you could.",
    "How that might be useful.",
    "Oh, I'm sorry jasm.",
    "Well.",
    "There are some things you can do.",
    "To help make it easier on your PC, of course, it maybe it's not possible right now.",
    "Maybe in the future, but if you are painting and you're having trouble with your computer and the processing, one thing that you can do is paint smaller, smaller resolution.",
    "So my image sizes 2000 by 2500 pixels.",
    "That's not very big.",
    "That's a reasonable size, but you could go smaller than this and still do good studies.",
    "Um?",
    "Yeah.",
    "So.",
    "You can use fewer layers like paint in a more traditional kind of method and then you don't have so many layers.",
    "That's that's going to, you know, so that's something that you can do if I think of other things.",
    "Um?",
    "Certain brushes certain tools can be more difficult on your processor too, so there are sometimes things you can do to help with that, but.",
    "Yeah, I hope you'll be able to to upgrade so that you can do what you want have.",
    "Hey Francesca.",
    "Thanks Janice.",
    "Oh, thanks, Mirthful.",
    "That's really nice to hear.",
    "I'm working on the Flowers right now.",
    "I know they feel really blurry at the moment.",
    "I can't wait to get some sharp details in here, but I'm kind of working my way up to it.",
    "Thank you.",
    "I hope you guys are having a good day.",
    "If anyone is just coming in and you want to take a look at the reference image, you can find a link to it in the description below.",
    "The stream.",
    "So putting in some where the center of the Flowers.",
    "And then I think we're going to.",
    "We're going to have to go in with a sharper brush, 'cause I just cannot get more detailed with approaches like.",
    "You're asking too much of me.",
    "I can't paint that small.",
    "OK, so new layer and let's grab this brush called wet paint brush in my brushes pack.",
    "And.",
    "I'm going to try.",
    "Sharpening up that some of the centers of the Flowers and some of the leaves.",
    "I'm not really sure what's the best approach.",
    "You know, maybe leaves, I mean pedals, but you guys know what I mean, petals?",
    "Let's try pedals first.",
    "Will try bringing some highlights out from the darker flower.",
    "That seems a bit intense.",
    "No, I like that.",
    "So there's some little stems coming up in between different areas here.",
    "It just seems so.",
    "I do, I do have Instagram.",
    "Let me paste the link in chat.",
    "Alright, I'm gonna try something else 'cause I'm not.",
    "I'm not getting the flow with these Flowers.",
    "I'm going to put a new layer on multiply and work on the overall values here.",
    "Maybe I'll use the lasso tool to block off some areas.",
    "And try to get some darker shadows.",
    "If you look at the reference beautiful photo, there's quite a lot more shadows and the Flowers and what I have and I feel like it's easier to paint something like this dark to light.",
    "So starting with things being a little bit darker and then I can go back and add like little individual pedals that have light hitting them.",
    "But I feel like it was really tough.",
    "what I was trying to do.",
    "Hi Ricardo, Banks, thank you.",
    "Yeah, we're mixing it up.",
    "I will probably do portraits a little bit more often.",
    "My guess you guys who are familiar with my work.",
    "No.",
    "I'm mainly a landscape painter, but I do like to do portraits too and it's been too long so we will try to make some more in.",
    "Oh thank you, thanks Hazem, appreciate that.",
    "Alright, we're getting there, but it's still a bit muddy, but we're getting there.",
    "I'm going to make a new layer and put it on overlay, so I first used multiply layer blending mode to add shadows, multiplies a really good one for shadows.",
    "The main one that I use if I want to add shadows and I don't always add shadows on a layer blending mode.",
    "I usually use lit layer blending modes when I want to add shadows to something that I've already rendered quite a bit and I don't want to have to like repaint it so it's more like adding a modification to that thing is just darkening it without covering everything.",
    "So multiply is good for that overlay I'll use in a similar situation when I want to add saturation.",
    "So I don't want to redraw this stuff, but I want to add a little bit of extra.",
    "Glow extra colour.",
    "So I'll make a new layer, put it on overlay.",
    "Maybe do a little trial and error with the colours.",
    "See what works, but in this case I'm adding a little bit more of a vibrant warm glow.",
    "The before and after.",
    "And then I'll make a new layer an.",
    "Now we can look at adding the petals, and I can try again with this brush so far.",
    "I've been sticking to just a few brushes for these couple of paintings I've done today, an.",
    "I don't really want to.",
    "I want to avoid.",
    "God is spreading out from that.",
    "I'm trying to stick with like a minimal brushes for these and I'm hoping that will give them more of a cohesive look, inconsistent style.",
    "So I don't really want to fish around for a bunch more brushes.",
    "I'm hoping we can make it work with this.",
    "But the idea is I want to take what I have here with the flower, just kind of like add some little.",
    "Extra finishing touches and then be able to say OK, it's done.",
    "Simplifying these Flowers.",
    "It's been kind of tricky.",
    "But I think that could work.",
    "I think the way that one looks is OK.",
    "I like the center to be a little bit darker.",
    "Alright, I think that is going to work if I can make the other Flowers look like that.",
    "I think this will.",
    "This will be fine.",
    "OK, so I'm going to merge that down.",
    "And then we will keep going with this.",
    "But we had to do a couple of different attempts, do things in different order to find something that works.",
    "Alright, so let's paint some Flowers.",
    "I am assuming in a bit here, so I think that'll make things a little easier, but I don't want to zoom in too much, 'cause then I'll start to over do the details on the Flowers.",
    "We want them to read well and work well from about well really from full view, but this distance would be good.",
    "If I zoom in too much, what's going to happen is the Flowers will get super super detailed, which might look nice, but then we zoom out.",
    "It's like it's not going to be cohesive with the rest of the painting is just going to be all about the Flowers then.",
    "So.",
    "We try to avoid that.",
    "So I'm looking at the reference to see on each flower you know it's they're reaching out into the light when they're bunched up there a little bit darker.",
    "So whatever that latest highlight is, I'm trying to kind of accentuate that one.",
    "Is it really pretty Flowers?",
    "But they've got a ton of petals.",
    "If anybody is painting along with me.",
    "And you're you got to the Flowers.",
    "I'm sure you also had that a feeling like what?",
    "How many petals are there going to be in this?",
    "But it is pretty.",
    "And another bit of good news is we don't really have to paint all these Flowers in such detail, just a few, just a few that are more prominent.",
    "Like probably this group these three.",
    "I'm just holding alt an color picking from what's already there.",
    "I'm mostly just using the same colors since I've sort of figured it out from the other Flowers that I've done so far, I can just color pick from those Flowers when I'm painting these, and it's probably for the best because I want him to all look like the same flower.",
    "So I don't want to bring in a random color on one of them that I didn't use on the others.",
    "Some people would maybe disagree.",
    "I've heard the advice about.",
    "Not colour picking so much from your own painting 'cause it will eventually feel kind of dull.",
    "and I think there's something to that a little bit, but within something like this I think it makes sense to you.",
    "Color pic from my own painting and I do it all the time.",
    "Color picking from my own painting.",
    "I honestly think that it.",
    "Once you get enough colors in there, I think that it honestly helps with cohesiveness more than it hurts, but you do want to keep things fresh, so I think the idea is that you want to keep the colours fresh and lively in your painting.",
    "So as long as you're doing that.",
    "I don't think it's a problem.",
    "Well, I'm kind of being at the process here.",
    "Maybe we can go in assembly line, flower painting mode.",
    "Why all the yellow petals in one go all the Flowers?",
    "Now would be the center.",
    "You know it would help.",
    "Probably looking at this in black and white.",
    "I feel like the Flowers have a lot of subtle.",
    "Yeah, look at that whole.",
    "Check this out guys.",
    "Look at the real photo.",
    "The Flowers in black and white, and then look at mine.",
    "So I need a lot more light areas, but overall the Flowers on the left side or like much darker than the Flowers on the right.",
    "So there is a good reason to turn your painting in black-and-white, 'cause sometimes you're surprised.",
    "I'm just going to paint in black and white for a little bit.",
    "So I showed this at the beginning of stream and I can show it again 'cause I know some of you weren't here that Ben to turn your painting in the black and white like this.",
    "You have to.",
    "Set it up as a shortcut and then once you've done that, you can just do that anytime.",
    "And it's super handy and easy to do.",
    "Just pressing CTRL Y.",
    "Hey Andy.",
    "Howdy, welcome.",
    "Let me show you real quick.",
    "You guys you can go to view, proof, setup custom and then select device to simulate working grade gain 20% and then press OK.",
    "And then anytime you press CTRL Y, you'll get the black and white view and you can paint.",
    "In this view you can color picking paint in this view.",
    "Anything that you, any colors that you color, pick and use it will be the real colors, not the grey.",
    "So that's something that.",
    "In whatever other ways that you might desaturate, you don't have the ability to color pick the real colors and paint with them.",
    "Like this, so that's why I like to do it this way.",
    "But hopefully will get more to the right value range with the Flowers, so we're going to bring the later yellows over here.",
    "Sometimes you can be harsh to do those tests, but it's good to find out what's wrong.",
    "All thank you, thanks Steven.",
    "Thanks Kevin, I appreciate that we're getting there with the.",
    "So after I work on the Flowers a little bit more until they feel yeah, the Flowers, they just need to be acceptable.",
    "I'd like them to be nice, but they're not the point of the scene, but they need to be like good enough that you're just like, Oh, she's holding some nice Flowers.",
    "I don't want them to get the tractor.",
    "I like what's going on with those Flowers.",
    "So I feel like I was getting for awhile.",
    "But yeah, after we work on the Flowers a little bit more and they're like.",
    "They're good.",
    "Then we're going to work on the hair in the face little bit more.",
    "The hair is just like a big block right now, but we're going to add some little shines.",
    "A little flyaways.",
    "Not much hair is pretty like smoothing and nice, but we can add some little.",
    "I mean, I think that it's pretty to have those little fly away things in the ponytail.",
    "Um, let's see power versus my conscious mind will always say don't go for too much details.",
    "What is not going to show up of my subconscious mind is always pushing for more details of sad.",
    "I promise I really understand.",
    "It's so hard not to get sucked into doing details.",
    "It's really, really tough.",
    "But you will get better at that.",
    "And like you're saying, but you are conscious of it, that's so huge because not not everyone is, you know it's.",
    "I wasn't until a certain point in my.",
    "Art education, and I mean our education wise I wasn't even thinking about official education but just online watching tutorials, listening to other artists talk and learning.",
    "That way I started getting the idea.",
    "OK, I need to be.",
    "Need to learn how to simplify things more and not get too into details, and that's hard when it's your natural tendency.",
    "But it does get better and like the fact that you're thinking about that and you're working on it, it's going to improve overtime.",
    "The more the more you practice.",
    "Oh thank you yeah scenario, thank you.",
    "So I think something that that I could probably do to improve this is maybe put some more Flowers that are like facing, like different ways in the reference, the.",
    "The Flowers are not all perfectly upright, and some of them are kind of scratched up a little bit.",
    "And maybe that's a bit more natural.",
    "Mine kind of got a bit organized.",
    "But that's OK.",
    "Speaking of fighting your subconscious, one of my battles is.",
    "Not making things to organize like that.",
    "Like, especially when you're painting Flowers or.",
    "Anything organic you want to let there be imperfections and stuff, and it can be hard to.",
    "Oh Janice, that's so sweet.",
    "Thank you.",
    "So I just did all this work and I'm going through purposely smudge some of it away, but the issue I have here is that.",
    "I don't.",
    "I think the balance between soft and hard edges is not quite satisfying to me yet.",
    "I find there needs to be more.",
    "Softness.",
    "Maybe I could try using the mixer brush a little bit.",
    "So the mixer brush is something that I don't have a full handle on yet, but I think it's fun to dry.",
    "It's the icon for the mixer brushes.",
    "This paint brush with a little paint drop here.",
    "And.",
    "Yeah, so we have this brush and all of the.",
    "Settings up here are related to the mixer brush and how dry or wet.",
    "How much paint is on the brush, how much it's going to mix with what's already on the on, the canvas it supposed to imitate, like a real painter mixing together and stuff like that.",
    "So if I if you press alt just like with the clone stamp tool or the color Picker, you press alt and it's going to select from a certain area and you can see up here what it's selecting so I can select this grey part.",
    "I can select sure I can select in between two things and then you'll see this kind of thing happening.",
    "And then when you paint.",
    "It takes that selection and uses that as your paint.",
    "What's on your paintbrush?",
    "So it's very cool forgetting.",
    "Traditional kind of feeling and that might be a cool thing to do here.",
    "I could smudge a bit the.",
    "Some of the edges with the Flowers.",
    "Steven says regarding details.",
    "The thing I picked up from photography is to preserve as much detail as possible.",
    "You might produce something thinking it would be printed 77 by 5 at 72 DPI.",
    "Then the customer wants a 90 inch art prints of 600 DPI.",
    "That's a very good point.",
    "So what I would say to that is you can still make it a large canvas Ann.",
    "Hi, Hi DPI, but you can still paint with larger brushes.",
    "In relationship to that and still avoid getting hyper fixated on little things but still make it.",
    "But still make it nice for printing, but that's a good point.",
    "Thank you Paramo.",
    "Just came to mind.",
    "Is this the same model we painted for art clips of time ago?",
    "I'm not crazy.",
    "It's possible because a lot of the photographers that I.",
    "Follow on pixels and Unsplash in places like that.",
    "I probably used multiple photos from the same photographers before so it could be.",
    "I'm not sure if it is.",
    "I'm having trouble being able to tell.",
    "But it really it's very possible.",
    "But yeah, so this is getting in to be a little bit of a different style.",
    "If I continue with these kind of brush strokes, but I think it's kind of fun.",
    "This a little bit of traditional feeling and you can go over so for the using the mixer brush.",
    "I kind of like to use it like what I'm doing here when I already painted something and then going back and adding some fun textures and stuff and going on top.",
    "Working in edge is doing things like this.",
    "I don't really like to paint from scratch with this brush because I feel like.",
    "It works best when you have we already have stuff on the canvas to go from.",
    "I don't really like it so much when I'm trying to paint with it from scratch, but I don't.",
    "I think maybe.",
    "This is more what you're supposed to do with it.",
    "I'm not sure I'm egnew to exploring the mixer brush, but you can see is really cool.",
    "I'm supposed to be painting Flowers and I'm all over the place, but I hope you guys find the mixer brush interesting.",
    "Look you can color pic from this and then look at that.",
    "Look at that.",
    "Get all these crazy streaky effects.",
    "So this mixer brush is going to be included in the new brush pack the time.",
    "Making that I'm going to be selling.",
    "If anyone's interested, this one that I'm using right now.",
    "I have saved this one and if a couple others that I.",
    "Came up with better working, nice enough to think it might be good to include.",
    "But it's definitely the closest effect that I found in.",
    "Photo shop to real paint is very, very cool.",
    "It's also fast because you're cloning like multiple colors at one time.",
    "So for me to come in and add more shading to the Flowers like this, it's faster.",
    "I don't have to.",
    "I have multiple colors on my brush at one time.",
    "Oh Foster, maybe that is her.",
    "Oh, maybe that's The One.",
    "I'm trying to see like where else I can use this.",
    "I do want to paint some things on her with this too, not just the Flowers and not just her outfits.",
    "I want to.",
    "It's consistent style.",
    "Also we can use this in the background.",
    "So maybe a little bit of an interesting touch.",
    "To make it with more painting.",
    "I kind of like this accidental square I got over here.",
    "Oh no.",
    "Yeah, that stuff.",
    "I feel like until you get involved with the digital.",
    "Digital desire and design world and have some experience with DP eyes and file sizes.",
    "It can be really confusing.",
    "Yeah, a lot of people that aren't involved in that kind of stuff have no idea how sizes and DPI's work.",
    "Thank you Jane, thank you.",
    "I would suggest about the whole DPI thing to do some Googling.",
    "If anyone's listening in and you want to learn more about it.",
    "But basically, just to give some basic information.",
    "Resolution default web resolution is 72, so if you're making something that's just going to be for Internet use, it's fine to make it at that size.",
    "If you think you're going to want to print it out, you might want to make it 300 DPI just in case.",
    "'cause That's going to be the proper resolution for print and then you'll be in the right place right after that and.",
    "You want to consider the maximum size you might want to print it out too.",
    "So for example.",
    "Realistically, regardless of the original resolution, if the painting is big enough pixel wise, you can still make a nice big program.",
    "You can still make a nice break print of it.",
    "You can change it to be.",
    "In the 300 resolution format, and if it's enough pixels, it's going to be fine, but the point is, if you if you know you're going to print it from the start I would.",
    "When you're making your image when you're making your file, I would just go to pixels or not pixels in inches or centimeters like whatever you use and put in 300 resolution and then put in the size that you want it to be.",
    "Like the size you want to print it out and make it that size from the beginning.",
    "You know?",
    "And then you don't have any problems later trying to scale it.",
    "Let me see so Jackson.",
    "Oh, let me take a peek.",
    "Let's see, did we find her?",
    "No.",
    "She has the same eyebrows.",
    "I don't know.",
    "I don't think it's her.",
    "But they have a very similar look.",
    "I could be wrong, I could be wrong, that's really tricky one, especially because we're not seeing her about her.",
    "Nose is similar to.",
    "I don't think so.",
    "I don't think it's her, but that's a really tricky one.",
    "It could be.",
    "Ha, that's tricky.",
    "When I signed for magazine rapper some decades back, I just did it 72 DPI without having any idea, no.",
    "All that's so sad.",
    "I think everyone.",
    "I think everyone who is ever gotten involved in digital arts hasn't like gone through that mistake.",
    "I don't know anybody who has escaped it.",
    "It's like it's just happens to everyone.",
    "It's part of learning process.",
    "It's like you don't just know this stuff, you know you.",
    "There's no you don't born knowing about it.",
    "You should learn it at some point and most of most of us are learning that from sadly having experience.",
    "Of making something too small or whatever at the beginning.",
    "But hey, once you make that mistake, you're not going to forget about it.",
    "I say that every once in a while I still have the experience where I paint something.",
    "Not thinking I was going to end up liking it so much and like, Oh, it's just a quick sketch.",
    "And then later I'm like you know what that kind of like this.",
    "I would like to print it and then it's too small.",
    "But Um Judy says here's my version where the girl is so disappointed with the rubbish Flowers she's been given.",
    "Ah, that's funny.",
    "I you know, I, I don't think I would have read her her expression that way if you say so.",
    "But now that you mention it.",
    "She could be side eyeing the Flowers a little bit.",
    "This is a very delicate.",
    "I like your color palette.",
    "It's very pretty.",
    "Also a little bit your own from the reference, but I like that.",
    "I like that.",
    "Nice, I like the shine on the cheek bone.",
    "Very satisfying.",
    "Cool, thank you for painting with me.",
    "I really I really enjoy seeing.",
    "Different.",
    "Different art styles.",
    "Trying out the references.",
    "And yeah, it's just nice to have have some company while doing studies and things.",
    "It makes it go little, go along a little easier.",
    "So right now I'm adding some little stray hairs and Flyaways and things to the to the top of the head.",
    "I have to be careful because I really wanted to still look like her proper head shape.",
    "One thing that I used to do so I can, I guess I could share this mistake with you guys.",
    "Maybe you will avoid doing this in your work, but one thing that I used to do was get so carried away with like I'm going to give her all these fun little WAVY things and I would get so carried away with all these loose WAVY.",
    "Designs, but it would.",
    "I would lose the head shape eventually.",
    "You know what I mean and then it would start to what kind of a natural and I wouldn't know why it is because we can't.",
    "You still want to get you still want to be able to tell the shape of her head you want to add little things but not go totally wild.",
    "I mean, unless you do want to go totally while that's sometimes you drive someone with crazy hair and that's cool.",
    "But generally it's more flattering if you can still tell the head shape somewhere in there.",
    "At least on part of the head, you know, like she could have her hair could be going out, totally getting her hair could be doing whatever it wants, but you've got to have.",
    "Part of it like tight to the head somewhere it kind of helps if you have like.",
    "Anyway, this is sort of a generalization, but I noticed it sometimes when I would try to add crazy curls and waves.",
    "My layers, including my blending modes.",
    "Totally ruined my peace.",
    "I had to do it all again.",
    "Almost missed the deadline.",
    "Once I wanted advanced Photoshop magazine competition, they asked for the work to be sent to them, but actually planned it all.",
    "Oh man.",
    "Holy cow, well congratulations, but that's super stressful.",
    "Oh man.",
    "Well, thanks Judy.",
    "Crazy says the hair of mine is just getting all quiz like she's looking like 50,000 life.",
    "Ha ha ha.",
    "I like Flyaways.",
    "I think they give a lot of.",
    "Like spirit and.",
    "Liveliness to the hair if your stylizing, of course, you don't need to go in that direction, but I like adding like little little hairs and stuff lying around.",
    "Let's see I have not used Photoshop to paint before, could be quick enough to follow you next time though I paint manually.",
    "Um, so when you say manually, do you mean like with a mouse?",
    "Or do you mean?",
    "Um?",
    "Let me know what you mean by that, but.",
    "I do try to explain what I'm doing as I go and go at A.",
    "Um?",
    "Hopefully a rate of speed that you can follow along as far as like understanding and learning, but I don't know if you're just starting out.",
    "If you'd be able to follow along, live an like paint along in real time I say this because when I was first starting out I had to you have to learn first like where things in menus are and how to do stuff.",
    "And sometimes that kind of thing can slow you up.",
    "In you know in following something in real time what I used to do was follow some tutorials on YouTube because then I would be able to pause and restart the tutorial whenever I wanted to an I ended up having to do that and like rewatch some of 'em and just re watch parts that confuse me and kind of do that.",
    "That sort of thing.",
    "Stopping and starting it as needed so.",
    "You're definitely welcomed.",
    "I would love if you join us, but I don't want you to be discouraged if it's not possible to follow along in real time.",
    "If you're just starting out 'cause there would be, it would probably be pretty difficult, but what you can do is if you go to my page here, if you go to my profile here on the hands and go to the videos tab, you can watch any of my past videos at any time.",
    "Going back to.",
    "I mean it's almost is getting a few months away from a year now.",
    "I think August maybe was when I had my first dream is from here, so there's lots of videos going all the way back and there's this cool thing that be hands have the tool timeline.",
    "So this is capturing the tool that I'm using as I'm using it and it doesn't show when I'm live, but if you're watching the replay it will show that that's also something that's like easier to follow along in the replay and then you can pause and start the video again at anytime, so that's probably what I would suggest if you want to really follow along.",
    "Oh, you paint oil?",
    "That's awesome.",
    "Well then that's different.",
    "That's different then then.",
    "That's probably a It's probably fine.",
    "I guess that's then just up to how fast, like what you're painting speed is, you know.",
    "I don't have a lot of experience in an oil, sadly, but I'm not sure that would depend.",
    "I guess I usually spend about two 2 1/2 hours per painting an I usually stream for about 5 hours.",
    "Um, somewhere in the four to six range we usually right at five hours is way what I do on Wednesdays so.",
    "Um?",
    "I would say.",
    "Got your welcome to try an if it's too fast then you could.",
    "You could always do the follow along in the videos.",
    "It is the same girl.",
    "Her name is Alejandra that is like a perfect name for her I think especially with this red dress.",
    "I don't know, it just feels right.",
    "Nice Jackson, well that's awesome, I'm impressed.",
    "For some reason I don't know if it's the lipsticks, but through me or just the profile view, but I wasn't.",
    "You know, when I started to think you might have been right with her nose.",
    "But I just I just wasn't enough.",
    "Yeah, were seen it.",
    "That's cool.",
    "Also Jane, Let me give you another link.",
    "This is a lot of stuff, so feel free to just skim through and cherry pick what you like, but I've been collecting tutorials and resources and things that helped me out over the.",
    "Over the years.",
    "So I just posted in the chat the link to that.",
    "It's like a list of tutorials and things, so if you wanted to peruse through there, there's some.",
    "There's free tutorials, things on YouTube, there's tutorials you can buy.",
    "All kinds of stuff.",
    "I know project isn't it absolutely crazy like it's hard to believe.",
    "And thanks for being here since the beginning.",
    "It's very cool.",
    "Yeah, it's nice that the videos.",
    "Are available for so long like the past, the streams from the videos from past streams, even from way back then are available, so there's like tons of.",
    "Tons of streams that catch up on if you're looking to.",
    "Join in with this kind of thing and I always share my reference and I shared them.",
    "I think you can access all those files after the fact, so if you wanted to like watch any of the past streams and try to paint along during those, then the reference files should be there.",
    "So I'm trying to get her.",
    "Eyebrow Shaper, right?",
    "It's a little tricky.",
    "I think maybe I.",
    "Her eyebrows, little closer down and they should be.",
    "I'm not sure I'm just going to keep going.",
    "Yeah, she is a very pretty nose though.",
    "Stephanie says, I've been wondering what is the next big thing you like to achieve in your art career?",
    "Like another level and thing you work towards to one day say I did it.",
    "Oh There is nothing that immediately comes to mind.",
    "I hope it's not disappointing.",
    "Some people have a particular goal concrete goal like they want to work for a certain company or they want to.",
    "I don't know make a book or something like that for me.",
    "I just want to.",
    "I want to keep working on my painting skills and I want to get better at teaching too, like I think that's almost a separate skill from painting an I wanted.",
    "Do more tutorials in the future, maybe In addition to an separate from live streaming, as much as I love streaming, sometimes it's hard to explain something in a very, very step by step manner on stream, because there can be all kinds of little interruptions and things like we might start talking about something random, something else.",
    "So then it's like harder to go in exact order, so I would like to do some more, make more tutorials In addition to being alive an.",
    "I don't know.",
    "I don't know about specific goals, but I just want to keep working on my art and my ability to share with others.",
    "Process and teaching things and share inspiration.",
    "and I guess I'm kind of exploring like how that's possible via the Internet.",
    "There's lots of different ways streaming.",
    "I think for me streaming in recorded tutorials probably make the most sense.",
    "I know some people do books, write books and do that kind of thing, but I've never.",
    "I've always found that through videos are it's easier for me to learn, so that's kind of the content that I'm more interested in making.",
    "Books are good too, but everyone learns in different ways and I found books not as helpful for me as videos.",
    "Hey sing.",
    "Thank you, I'll we're doing good.",
    "We're painting the.",
    "We're keeping people today.",
    "Ladies, I should say yeah we're doing.",
    "Maybe will do some purchase of guys in the future too.",
    "I tend to prefer painting women so I'm not as good at painting guys 'cause I get less practice.",
    "So we should do some of that too, but here were the two paintings that I did today.",
    "Pretty different vives.",
    "But that's what we've been working on.",
    "Oh no, that's OK, Stephanie.",
    "I just.",
    "I kinda wish there was like something some big thing, but I think maybe I'll find that you know what I mean.",
    "Maybe it will become more obvious I guess.",
    "I'm really happy being doing what I get to do now.",
    "I'm being an independent artist so I want to just.",
    "Keep doing that and exploring where it takes me and how I can.",
    "Yeah, move along with teaching on line and knowledge sharing, exploring art techniques and stuff like that.",
    "Thank you clears that you know what I think you just found my.",
    "You know what I would love that so I didn't think of it off the top of my head.",
    "But I guess that would be a good goal for me as someone who wants to continue teaching.",
    "And yeah, something like that would be really cool to do in the future.",
    "When they will meditate.",
    "Sci-fi, hum.",
    "We could just put like a helmet on her and call it sci-fi like shoes.",
    "She's in space.",
    "Do a little.",
    "Do.",
    "There you go.",
    "I did sci-fi.",
    "Although there's a few problems with this outfit, she's not quite covered.",
    "She's not quite sealed in move to do something like this.",
    "There we go.",
    "But thank you, Stephanie.",
    "When they will make it right.",
    "Oil painting maybe maybe.",
    "Someday.",
    "I've got too many mediums at the moment, but.",
    "I would like to someday.",
    "Really like the dreamlike quality of light in the first one at thank you, I really love that.",
    "The photo for that reason.",
    "Yeah, I prefer like if I'm going to pick my favorite type of images to paint from or scenarios paint from with this in real life is.",
    "Any type of setting was a big splash of light.",
    "I think it just looks like a lot of Drama and it's really pretty.",
    "And it helps was showing form really well.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Would you make a package and sell it on you'd?",
    "Me like tutorial on different categories, landscape, portrait, etc.",
    "Yeah, I would consider that I would most likely probably just sell it through a personal website or maybe gumroad or something like that, but yeah.",
    "Helmet go sci-fi.",
    "Maybe the Flowers are from her robot lover.",
    "Oh my gosh, crazy, you're right, that's so cute.",
    "I slept a little.",
    "Only on the Flowers.",
    "So silly.",
    "Yeah, I need to make an alternate version of this.",
    "Christmas ready for outer space.",
    "Sometimes we do the before and after and I'm just like that get better or not I don't know.",
    "I her mouth is like.",
    "Very different from the reference what I've done.",
    "It's ended up giving her a different.",
    "Expression and I.",
    "I don't dislike it, but I'm going to try getting a little closer to the reference and see if I prefer that.",
    "If not I might leave it as is.",
    "Like it's kind of like she's.",
    "I don't know.",
    "I've given her.",
    "I almost like a more of A.",
    "She's more upset in mine or something.",
    "By project, thanks for hanging out.",
    "I hope you have a good rest of your day.",
    "See you later.",
    "Well I like to explain what I'm doing as I go through, but I'm at this stage of the painting where there's there's not like anything.",
    "Very big happening.",
    "It's like tiny little tweaks.",
    "I'm just looking around the painting to see what might be able to improve, testing little details, trying little things out.",
    "And usually at this point I just kind of.",
    "Move around the painting based on what catches my eye like.",
    "What is, if anything, is distracting me in a bad way.",
    "If anything catches my eye and I'm like, why don't like that?",
    "I'll go there and start working on that area to try to fix it.",
    "'cause I don't want any of the parts of the painting distracting me in a negative way.",
    "I want to be able to like look at the painting in a relaxed way.",
    "Feel like it's working.",
    "So that's usually when I feel like it's a done when I feel like a painting is done is when I stop having that feeling of like what's wrong here.",
    "What's wrong here and like going around the painting looking for little things to fix when I finally feel like I could just look at the painting and kind of be a piece.",
    "and I know for some people that feeling comes a little bit more.",
    "Like slowly or it's more difficult to feel that I'm I'm lucky 'cause I feel like it usually.",
    "At some point I do feel like.",
    "I've reached at least the Level.",
    "I'm happy enough with it.",
    "You know, I feel like some artists say there.",
    "There they feel like a piece is never done and they just kind of abandoned it.",
    "I understand that feeling too.",
    "Sometimes I get that, but a lot of times I feel like I do reach a place where I'm like Alright.",
    "Well, that's enough for this one or I feel like at my current skill level, this is the best I'm going to do with this one and just end it and keep trying on the next one and.",
    "It took me awhile to get to that place because I used to.",
    "Sort of work and rework areas were very frustrated manner.",
    "But Original picture is a bit more chin and a little less under her lower lip.",
    "Yeah, her chin was, yeah oh I see that I see that yeah her chin proportions have been a struggle for me the whole time and see if I can fit that.",
    "Red Oh, welcome back my goal, thank you.",
    "Thank you were working around here trying to.",
    "Figure out some little things with the chin.",
    "I think I do think it's better.",
    "Thank you, Foster.",
    "Sometimes you also need a fresh look.",
    "I might take a little break after stream and then come back for this after stepping away from the computer for a little bit.",
    "And maybe you know I see something different then.",
    "Sometimes that's true.",
    "You just need a little bit of a break.",
    "But this was fine.",
    "Thank you guys for being so like excited about doing portraits.",
    "I really enjoyed it.",
    "We're going to go for a little bit longer, but we're nearing the end so I'm just going to try to Polish it up and go through some finishing things.",
    "Thank you you are a.",
    "I'm happy you think so.",
    "I think the mixer brush came in and really helped out with that.",
    "Her ear has a little bit more like lightness and saturation than what I have done, so I'm going to try to bring in this lick lighter orange color.",
    "Just around the edge you'll see in the reference to the warm color to her skin.",
    "Just as a little bit more lights to it.",
    "So if anybody was painting along for this one, and you do want to share before the end of stream.",
    "I would say maybe this is a time to upload your work or upload like a work in progress.",
    "I don't want to like rush you and through ending your painting instantly, but if you do want to share wherever your at with this one before we end, I would say.",
    "This is a good time to start uploading it somewhere so that you can post it in the chat room quick before before we head off for the day.",
    "Oh, by tax and thank you so much for painting with me.",
    "I enjoyed your 3D artworks.",
    "And thank you for the next comments about my pay days.",
    "Think faster.",
    "I still need to fix a couple little anatomy things with the ear.",
    "I can't per skip out on it.",
    "Kevin says, do you ever get halfway through a painting and discover a new style and think oh, that looks good.",
    "I think I'll finish there even though it's not where you intended it to end.",
    "Yeah, I've had all sorts of things like that happen.",
    "You know one thing that's also happened, especially at the beginning when I was first getting into digital painting is I would you know, you're learning a lot in a short time 'cause everything is new, so you're learning all the tools and everything and I would have quite a few circumstances where.",
    "Uhm, I would start with a painting and by the halfway through or or somewhere around there I would be like Oh my gosh I would have done this so differently just based on everything you learn during the process of doing that one painting I would think Oh my gosh, I would have started this so differently if I was going to restart it and it sometimes it gets the point where you're just like you know what.",
    "I'm just going to call it done here and just apply what I learned to the next one because it's too hard to kind of try to save this and I'm realizing now that.",
    "I did some fundamental things wrong at the beginning kind of thing, so I had a lot of unfinished paintings when I very first got into digital 'cause I was just learning so much and I was.",
    "It was hard by the end of a painting to finish it, 'cause I would be like, Oh, you know what I now I know how to do it.",
    "I'm just going to do it differently now and so I would just kind of move along.",
    "I've left unfinished ones from the early days, but it does get a little easier with that whole thing.",
    "But randomly, yeah, you know I don't finish all the.",
    "Well, when I say don't finish, I don't finish to a quality that I would publish online at everything that I do like I do a lot of studies that I just say OK, well there was an hour.",
    "There was two hours.",
    "I learned something I don't really love it, but I learned something and I'll get to apply that knowledge in future projects.",
    "And I'm just going to call this one done, you know, not every artwork that I do is something that I want to.",
    "Publish and share and look at forever.",
    "You know, sometimes we just do something for the experience of doing it.",
    "I don't always even save the paintings that I make like sometimes, especially in evenings.",
    "If I'm just going to do like a little sketch, sometimes they just open Photoshop and it kind of paint.",
    "This is when I sometimes just paying from my head to like almost always when I study, I use reference and when I'm even more in personal work, I'll gather references to get the best results.",
    "But sometimes I'll just doodle around without reference and sometimes they don't even save those files.",
    "I just kind of come in here, paint random stuff, and then just like close it.",
    "Ann It's just I don't know.",
    "It's just too totally relaxed.",
    "And just enjoy the experience of painting and not worry one bit about.",
    "Saving it or needing to share it or making anything that's.",
    "You know?",
    "Presentable in any specific way is just about messing around.",
    "Sometimes it's fun to do that.",
    "As the same idea with like drawing with sidewalk chalk or something like that, it's like sometimes it's fun to just make an art even if it's going to get washed away with the rain and.",
    "And that's all that it was.",
    "Was just having some fun making it, doing a little sketch.",
    "Gareth says I really relate to that.",
    "Sometimes I can really psych myself out thinking it has to be good enough to post before I even start.",
    "Yeah, I know.",
    "I know that feeling that's when I started doing these time studies.",
    "Then I kind of like let myself relax from that a bit and I was like look, this is just a study you don't need to post it, just do it for yourself.",
    "An overtime after a while of doing those.",
    "Then I ended up slowly finding ones that I liked enough to share and I shared a bunch of the studies that I do on Instagram, but I don't share all of them.",
    "Today I'm sure you guys remember once that I've worked on that haven't shown up on line.",
