    "Hello good morning everybody welcome high foster highly art.",
    "Hi Lisa, welcome everyone.",
    "I hope you guys are having a good day so far.",
    "Good to see you were going to be doing cloud studies today.",
    "So if anybody is interested in joining in, if you want to work on some skies for your landscapes for future landscapes, this is what we're going to be doing.",
    "Photo studies of today.",
    "So I'm going to be painting from these images and these beautiful photos are from various photographers.",
    "You can find links to their original posts below.",
    "The stream in the description.",
    "One of them is from Morguefile, One is from unsplash, well, two are from Unsplash and one is from pixels there a little bit from all over the place, but you can find the photographers below if you'd like.",
    "Hey Jennifer, saw the images.",
    "I really love the top left and bottom right.",
    "The colors are beautiful but I'm partial through colorful Sky scenes.",
    "Yeah, I totally agree.",
    "Let's see top left, bottom right.",
    "Those yeah well top right also is like very Contra high contrast that tends to like grab my attention when I look at the sheet but I would say top left and bottom right give me the most like happy feels.",
    "So.",
    "Oh, I'm glad you're doing better earlier, I'm glad you're feeling better.",
    "That's good news.",
    "So yeah, if you guys want to grab the reference images, you can find them in the stream description below the individual images.",
    "Or you can download above the chat.",
    "There should be info tab and I uploaded a like a.",
    "Basically this sheet right here.",
    "It's like a combination of all of 'em and it's still pretty high res, so you can pay from this if you want to just get a big collage to work from.",
    "So.",
    "I hope you guys are able to see me OK.",
    "Is there a lot of buffering or are we doing alright?",
    "I got a little message that there was some connectivity issue.",
    "For a moment there, so I hope I hope it's OK.",
    "Yeah, I'll just keep going.",
    "You guys can let me know.",
    "OK so well I'm going to get set up to do painting so I'm going to move the references over to the other monitor.",
    "And will make a.",
    "Sheet the paint on.",
    "And I'm going to make this pretty large, about 4000 by 4000 pixels.",
    "Something like that.",
    "Actually, maybe what's the size of my reference sheet?",
    "3500 by 2200 maybe I should go more in that size.",
    "Let's do that.",
    "Let's match the same size as my reference sheet.",
    "I'd like to match the dimensions anyway as far as the height and width.",
    "I can make it a little bit larger resolution Wise.",
    "Seems OK.",
    "OK, awesome, thank you Lisa.",
    "Hi Michael, thank you Jennifer.",
    "OK, I'm relieved to hear that.",
    "Little message and I was like no.",
    "No no no.",
    "OK.",
    "So.",
    "I'm just going to save this, so if you guys are interested, yeah, my image size is 4000 by 2500, roughly an.",
    "I think I'm going to be doing what we did the other a couple streams ago where we did for images and kind of did little sketches of each one.",
    "Leards, you're not going to screw it up, and besides, it's just practice.",
    "So even if you do, you're allowed OK.",
    "That's what we're here to do.",
    "We're here to learn, so yeah, it's not going to be perfect.",
    "I'm going to try to do these about an hour and a half for each painting so I know that my I'm sure they aren't going to be perfect, but I hope that I can learn something about color, light values maybe.",
    "Some textures with the clouds.",
    "Just get a little practice in.",
    "Alright so cloud studies one.",
    "Hey Elgyem, Thanks, thanks for coming over is good to see you.",
    "I'm Alina OK, so let me show you guys my plan here if anybody wants to follow along and you can choose to do it this way too or organize it however you want, but I'm going to make.",
    "A little.",
    "A sheet for myself.",
    "So let's do something like this.",
    "I'm going to try to go from the reference.",
    "So we have two images over here that are.",
    "More square Oh, you know what I could do guys?",
    "I just realized I'm making this a lot harder for myself and it needs to be.",
    "We could do it this way.",
    "So basically I want to study sheet and I'm going to be painting these images.",
    "So one thing that can make it easier for me as if I don't know if you ever notice this.",
    "But if I'm doing a.",
    "If I'm doing a painting from reference, I find that it helps me to paint the image in the same aspect ratio as the original.",
    "So if I'm ever re cropping it then I like to actually crop my reference too, 'cause if I'm ever just cropping the image itself.",
    "I feel like that's a little difficult in my brain to translate, so anyway, Long story short.",
    "I want to paint within these squares.",
    "That's my plan.",
    "Hyalina hybrid good to see you all.",
    "Yeah, I hope so.",
    "We are.",
    "I don't know if I can do it.",
    "I don't know if I can do all four but I'm really I'm gonna try.",
    "What do you guys think?",
    "So we have.",
    "We have managed it before here in the stream.",
    "We've done speedpaint session where we did for images and then another time when I tried that I only got through three, so my goal will be to get through all four today.",
    "But we'll see how it goes.",
    "And you guys are welcome to do however many you want.",
    "You don't have to be.",
    "Doing at super speed and less you want to if you want a big challenge, but the idea is just to talk my talk through my thoughts here.",
    "The idea is not that I'm going to paint superspeed, it said I'm going to simplify the reference into something maybe a little stylized.",
    "That gets the feeling of the scene, but in a simpler way.",
    "So.",
    "That cropping is what I'm starting to do.",
    "Some time I'll post my work.",
    "Yeah, I would like that you guys are welcome to share stuff you're working on if you want.",
    "Alright, so I'm going to put a Gray background just so I can see what I'm doing here, but I'm going to make a little stencil for myself, so I'm going to take a brush that has some texture to it.",
    "Do I have a certain brush I like to use for this, and then we're going to bring back in the white border, so this is just a little really a stencil for myself so I can paint underneath this white border.",
    "And I will always be in the lines.",
    "The Magic of Photoshop.",
    "Hey madzia, hey Jackson, get to see you were doing.",
    "We're going to attempt a speed cloud painting day.",
    "So we can learn.",
    "So we're making our little layout here.",
    "These are really fun to look at later.",
    "They're kind of like a little sketch book view.",
    "Alright, so now I can get rid of my little pencil drawing there an I have my Little Stencil outline so I'm going to lock this so this white part is going to be on the layer above everything else.",
    "The whole time I'm painting.",
    "So that will always be clean, so will lock that layer.",
    "I can get rid of my sketch rectangle sketch now and I think we're ready to start paintings to make sure I save this, yes?",
    "Hey David, get to see you.",
    "Well go.",
    "I made some tea.",
    "You guys before stream.",
    "So we're good to go here.",
    "Well, I think I'm just going to start with the top left again.",
    "You guys can find these references below in the stream description or on the info tab, and I'm going to put.",
    "A little thumbnail view up here using pure ref so it will hover above everything.",
    "And.",
    "Let's get started.",
    "Yeah, if you guys have any questions as we go let me know, but I'm going to talk through my process of how I'm going to approach these and I might take a little different approach depending on the image.",
    "So for this one.",
    "First, what I'm going to do is make a selection of the area.",
    "How should I do this?",
    "I don't want to deal with overspray of my painting onto the other areas here, so I'm just going to copy the background layer and paint underneath that.",
    "So now anything that I paint will be blocked off with in this because I have a Gray area here and I'll just end up getting rid of that later so.",
    "I could use a clipping mask also, but I think I want to use clipping masks, masks in my actual painting process.",
    "I'm going to save it for that.",
    "Oh, thank you Lisa it is.",
    "It is so this brush is coming soon.",
    "This precious coming soon.",
    "Although there are brushes somewhat like this in the free brush pack that you can download below my stream for anyone looking to play with some new brushes.",
    "But my custom pack is coming soon.",
    "I was trying to work on it this past weekend and then I got sucked into that Sailor Moon redraw an I ended up spending too much time on that.",
    "So I can show you real quick.",
    "I showed a sneak peek on my last stream here.",
    "I showed my quick work in progress, peek at my Sailor Moon, redraw painting that meme going around.",
    "And I can show you the finished one.",
    "Now to bring it full circle.",
    "But yeah, this is what I was working on last weekend a lot.",
    "And Yeah, there's some links to my Twitter and Instagram below the stream into the Scription.",
    "If anybody wanted to like look more closely at this, it's been posted there, but.",
    "Yeah, thank you, Sailor Moon.",
    "Delaying my brushes.",
    "All right?",
    "Like one of the light Rays meet you alright, let's get into it.",
    "So I'm going to start with a an airbrush.",
    "Just the regular airbrush I think.",
    "And we're going to get a nice blue Sky.",
    "I'm going to try.",
    "Well, without color picking, so we'll see how that goes.",
    "Will get pretty close, hopefully.",
    "So roughly, I'm seeing a little bit of a gradient with the top left being the darker part of the Sky.",
    "Something like this, although a lot of the lights coming from those Rays.",
    "A lot of people got into that redraw.",
    "You have one of the best all.",
    "Thank you.",
    "That's very nice of you.",
    "Yeah, I couldn't resist it because I was such a Sailor Moon fan growing up and it's like it was a big part of my inspiration getting into art so I couldn't.",
    "Couldn't resist.",
    "Thank you, father.",
    "So we've got a basic background.",
    "Now I'm going to switch to a brush that's a little bit as a little bit of a harder edge.",
    "So I was thinking something like this or.",
    "Yeah, just something you could use a hard Brown brush for this.",
    "You just need to use something that has a little bit of a harder edge.",
    "I think to block in the shape of the cloud it was.",
    "That's what I'm going to go for.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Lisa Alina.",
    "Thanks everybody.",
    "So for me, I find that it's easier to do one thing at a time, sometimes when it comes to painting.",
    "So for example, this cloud here.",
    "I'm going to just make these little little.",
    "Dad's little dab sheets, but I'm going to try to just get the shape of the cloud first.",
    "Before we get into the the shading of on the cloud and where the light is.",
    "So that's going to be my first task here, and it's a little hard to actually see what's going on on the underside of the cloud because of all the.",
    "The light Rays are pretty bright.",
    "But yeah, I'm not concerned with the color yet.",
    "I mean, I could degrade.",
    "It's like close to what's really going on.",
    "That will do one thing at a time.",
    "I would definitely suggest this kind of thing if you're feeling overwhelmed like begin with the silhouette shape of the whatever.",
    "The thing is that your painting.",
    "And just do it one step at a time that way.",
    "So for example, we have all this on one layer now.",
    "So I can go here to the checkerboard icon and.",
    "Press that down and now the transparency is locked so I could paint on top of this an I'll only be basically allowed to paint within the area that I already painted on, so very handy.",
    "So now I can come back in an choose a darker color for some shadows on the cloud.",
    "We can go darker or maybe a little bit towards like blue, purple little bit more more towards purple and I could start painting in darker areas like this.",
    "But it's a lot easier to start tackling this as a second step, so I already have the cloud shape in for the most part.",
    "Not perfect, but it's a start and then we can.",
    "The Shadows I I generally go with like sort of a base color, like a midtone color and then go shadows after that and then highlights.",
    "That's just what I've noticed has been my workflow.",
    "You don't have to.",
    "There will be exceptions like from image to image.",
    "Sometimes I'll paint a scenario that it seems easier to do it differently, but usually for me it's like mid tone colour than shadows and highlights.",
    "I kind of like the the highlights last.",
    "Back later to front or vice versa, which is your preferred method almost always back to front.",
    "But there can be exceptions.",
    "You know, sometimes you see you're working on certain illustration and they'll be like a strange composition or something and you're like going to do it differently.",
    "But I would say like 99% of the time I work it back to front.",
    "So in this case for me.",
    "I thought it was easiest to do the blue Sky, the flat loose guy back there, or like the gradient back there and then get to the clouds.",
    "There's not too much.",
    "In the scene so.",
    "But yeah, I definitely prefer to do back to front.",
    "So.",
    "The so I like to do digital and traditional art and what I'm doing digital.",
    "I like to take advantage of the digital tools at the same time.",
    "Sometimes I use traditional methods like under painting and stuff like that to get a well I think is a cool look, but for example, and it seemed like this the way that the photo is almost over exposed.",
    "It really.",
    "It's screaming color Dodge to me personally.",
    "So what I'm going to do is begin with.",
    "A little bit, maybe I'll get a more wispy type of brush since we've put first the.",
    "The main shape of the cloud now maybe we can go in with the sort of rim light highlight and maybe I'll use a little bit more of a wispy brush for this since we have a lot of textures on the outside and I'm going to put a little bit of lay a little bit of room light on the outside of the cloud.",
    "So what I've learned from using.",
    "Using.",
    "Color Dodge, which is a layer blending mode that will look at that.",
    "You guys are maybe already very familiar with, but in case anyone's not, I'll show you where you can find it and everything I like to paint first, sort of by hand.",
    "Or you know, just go in and manually paint the highlights, but room light and then use color Dodge to like bump it up and give it an extra glow.",
    "I prefer that too.",
    "Just using color Dodge right out of the gate 'cause I feel like it.",
    "I don't know.",
    "I just like the results better.",
    "I feel like it's more believable somehow.",
    "The color Dodge can occasionally be a natural, but I like it as a way to exaggerate, but the lighting that's already painted in.",
    "Um?",
    "LG and says what version of photo shop are you using?",
    "I'm actually using 2019 right now.",
    "I've been meaning to.",
    "To update to 2020 I grabbed the update when it first came out and I was having a little bit of weird interaction between it and my streaming process with OBSI.",
    "Don't know just what's causing me some issues, so I ended up going back to 2019 and I feel like by now it should probably be fine, but I haven't gone back and move things around since everything is like working great, but I probably should.",
    "But yeah, I'm using 2019 at the moment.",
    "Highlights of the highlight is true.",
    "Highlights are the best high Yarra.",
    "Yeah this one.",
    "Well, we'll see how it goes.",
    "I agree with you if it.",
    "And sometimes I have an idea when I'm starting a painting, like, oh, I know exactly how I'm going to do this, and sometimes I'm like, OK, we'll figure it out as we go.",
    "I do have a little bit of an idea how we're going to do this with the.",
    "I have some things I can show you tricks for doing the light Rays and stuff.",
    "Hopefully it'll workout like I think.",
    "But OK, so right now we have a very furry looking cloud and it's kind of funny.",
    "I'm going to use the, so here's something I like to use a lot when painting, skies anasa smudge brush.",
    "So I'm just going to make a regular paint stroke here to show you this is what the smudge brush that I have looks like.",
    "So if you want to download this one you can find it in the free brushes that are below in the stream description an I like to keep the strength level at about 30% as like a hiest so between 15 and 30% is good for me.",
    "And you just like, tap it lightly and you can get these nice blurred edges.",
    "and I love it because you can decide like when you want the blurring to stop.",
    "So I use this a lot in painting instead of using like a Gaussian blur filter or something like that, I just go in and manually blur it 'cause I like that organic quality in deciding when exactly where the blur is going to be so you can use that to get some last edges and stuff.",
    "And yeah, it's really fun.",
    "So for example I can come back in here after I painted all this and blur some of these edges so you get some of the hard edges.",
    "And some of those soft dissolving edges that you get in the Sky and the clouds.",
    "And yeah, I like to kind of go back and forth between painting and smudging.",
    "Not in every workflow, but it kind of depends on the look I'm going for it, and if I want a nice painterly workflow a lot of times I will do this.",
    "So.",
    "OK, values Wise I can tell you without even looking at the this in black and white that we are.",
    "Very like mild.",
    "Right now we need to bump up the contrast a lot so.",
    "The next thing will do is I'm going to make a new layer and put it on multiply mode and I'm going to take an airbrush.",
    "And we're going to give some more shadows.",
    "I've seeing I'm trying to figure out what color it is.",
    "It's almost like green.",
    "I don't know if I'm imagining that, but.",
    "Ah, I'm going to go to like a desaturated teal color and bring that.",
    "Bring some shadows into the clouds here so you can see.",
    "This is band of darker area here.",
    "I'm just going to do that.",
    "It looks a bit and mighty.",
    "So maybe I should hugest that a little bit more towards like blue or something but Gray is making it look a bit dirty but there's always that out.",
    "Try again.",
    "I'm gonna also choose the airbrushes my eraser 'cause right now some funky brush and it's making creepy pictures.",
    "Oh, OK, thank you for letting me know Masia I can either is fine, either is fine.",
    "I kind of like Madziar 'cause it sounds like.",
    "Well my name is Maddie, but then it sounds like fancy.",
    "Is a cool name.",
    "Hygiene yeah, thanks.",
    "Nice weather.",
    "It's actually really nice here to my where I am.",
    "I'm in the Netherlands right now and it's a yeah this guy we've got.",
    "Puffy blue clouds in the Sky right now.",
    "OK, so here we go.",
    "We've painted in some shadows, I could use a clipping masks.",
    "You clip this onto the clouds or.",
    "Or we can just let it be free, but I think I'll use the clipping mask.",
    "So here's my layers so far.",
    "I have the background Sky, a blank layer that I don't know what that's therefore will just move it and then yeah, this so basically only two layers at the moment, so we have a new layer.",
    "Now we're going to paint.",
    "Let's be just a little bit freely free painting on top.",
    "Here you can add some more details and stuff so there's a little area with a anywhere that clouds become thinner.",
    "There's you can see the light glow kind of coming through.",
    "So for example up here.",
    "Right there, the clouds a little thinner so it gets lighter.",
    "If anybody is curious, this brush that I'm using now is also in the brushes pack you can download below and it's the soft shading and blending brush.",
    "Wanted to share my last painting.",
    "Hope you like it.",
    "I'll take them.",
    "Any critique would be Great.",
    "Alright, let's see what LG ends up to.",
    "Beautiful portrait.",
    "Wow, check this out guys.",
    "I love the traditional vibe that you get.",
    "This one is very nice mood.",
    "'cause of the lighting?",
    "Imagine she's like sitting in front of a window or something.",
    "The soft hair.",
    "Well, as far as critique, there's nothing bothering me.",
    "There's nothing standing out to me.",
    "Um, the anatomy looks good.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Yeah.",
    "I'm sorry to disappoint you, pretty quiet, so I don't really have any advice.",
    "It's a beautiful painting.",
    "I hope you're happy with this one that would be.",
    "Yeah, if it has a kind of oil painting, feeling nice, subdued palette too.",
    "My full name is Magdalena.",
    "Surnames are very similar.",
    "They are they are similar.",
    "Madeline.",
    "OK, so I'm just going around with a little bit more of this soft silver lining and we're getting close to doing some from color Dodge here.",
    "So I'm going to.",
    "Duplicate the cloud layer because it was a bit maybe a bit too transparent in some areas.",
    "And let's do some color Dodge, so I'm going to make a new layer and double click on the layer and when it brings up the layer style, I'm just going to Unclick the transparency shapes layer because I like this.",
    "How it effects the color Dajan makes the effect a little bit more saturated colors.",
    "And I will choose the Airbrush again.",
    "It's already on color Dodge mode.",
    "I'm going to clip.",
    "I'm going to create a clipping mask on to the cloud layer.",
    "And then let's bring in some this bright color, and we're going to choose like a warm warm color for the.",
    "The painting color foreground color.",
    "And just kind of dab this in around the edges.",
    "So it needs a lot more finessing, but you can see that were like starting to get that right feeling from the reference.",
    "If you were to look at this zoomed out at a glance, you can kind of get where we're going with it.",
    "Jennifer says anyone here intermingled a photo with surrealism painting?",
    "If So what was the problems he faced?",
    "Interesting, I have not.",
    "But that's a good question.",
    "So anyone doing any photo manipulation and things like that?",
    "With surrealism Yeah, I think that would be a challenge.",
    "I could have really cool results.",
    "Can you guys see my avatar?",
    "Not yet, but I've seen a couple times LG on that.",
    "If you update like your name or profile picture, sometimes it just takes a few minutes before it shows up in chat and then suddenly it'll change.",
    "So maybe that's going to happen.",
    "I don't know how long ago you updated it, but hopefully it's just going to show up like in a couple minutes.",
    "Yes, now it's there.",
    "I see it suddenly.",
    "Yeah, I don't know what you did, but you got it.",
    "Nailed it.",
    "OK, so going back to the clouds, I'm going to paint a little bit more around the outside, so now we have this nice bright color.",
    "I'm going to color pic from it and just add these little wisps and highlights and.",
    "Hopefully will get a nice soft look right now.",
    "The cloud doesn't feel quite like what I want.",
    "I want it to feel more softon dissolving and right now it feels.",
    "Fuzzy.",
    "So now will keep working.",
    "Just adding some these little details.",
    "For me, cloud painting in the past, the cloud painting that I've done, I found that it just takes some time.",
    "There's a lot of back and forth and painting clouds usually have to do shadows and highlights if to paint some self edges, some hard edges, and it's just about layering to me, there might be other methods, but I've found that if they do, it just takes some time.",
    "There's not a really big shortcut to painting clouds.",
    "You do have to do some back and forth with shadows and highlights and eventually get the right look that you want.",
    "Complain with idea if I should leave that so this one area so overexposed, or if I should add some.",
    "Blue Sky picking through there.",
    "And we also try different brush, something that has a more wispy kind of thing going on.",
    "That can be nice for painting clubs.",
    "Dissolving texture.",
    "That's a charcoal portrait from Sergeant and check his charcoal stuff.",
    "Those are amazing.",
    "I haven't seen a lot of his charcoal.",
    "Actually I don't know if I've seen any of it to be honest.",
    "Other than, yeah, I've seen his watercolor work and oil.",
    "Have to check that out.",
    "Thanks for the recommendation.",
    "If anybody painting along, I hope you have a good time and enjoy your painting.",
    "Paint it Ella.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Thank you, you're just getting started over here with the we're going to do a number of Cloud Studies today.",
    "Hopefully let me keep an eye on the time 'cause I want to budget it out so we have time to do.",
    "Four and some of them might be a little more difficult.",
    "I'd like to flip.",
    "I don't know what I'm doing wrong lately.",
    "I used to be able to flip this.",
    "I don't know if I turned off that shortcut or something.",
    "I have no idea why I can't flip this reference anymore.",
    "I must have done something I'm talking about in pure ref, so it's a different shortcut than in photo shop, and for some reason I can't get it working.",
    "Oh well, that's OK, but sorry I'm not flipping my reference up there.",
    "Jane says Hi Mateas, you feel digital oil watercolor paint is a lot easier than painting by hand.",
    "If you mastered the Photoshop skill.",
    "Oh So I hope I'm going to answer your question what you're asking, so I've done.",
    "I haven't done oil painting, but I've done a lot of watercolor, gouache, that kind of thing an for me.",
    "There are some things that are a lot easier on digital because you can edit things and change them, and that flexibility is amazing and there are some things that are a little more difficult like some of the textures that you just naturally get using paper and traditional selfies.",
    "Although that's one of the things that it's become a real big passion for me is trying to imitate those textures in digital an figuring out like the puzzle of how to do it, and there's a lot of stuff you can use nowadays to really help with that.",
    "Like you can overlay a pig paper texture on to your work.",
    "You can use brushes that have a traditional look an.",
    "Yeah, others.",
    "There's definitely ways to get clothes, but I think that's where I would say the like.",
    "Sort of.",
    "Strengths and weaknesses.",
    "I think this may be a weakness of digital is some of the.",
    "Textures are really, really hard to have.",
    "Look at the same.",
    "You know?",
    "Thanks.",
    "Let me see Algerians link here.",
    "Who did he eventually make a painting of this person 'cause I feel like I've seen this before in the painting.",
    "Yeah.",
    "He's amazing.",
    "Alright, I'm going to switch to.",
    "A an airbrush.",
    "We're going to try to bring in some warm glow.",
    "I feel like I'm ending up with some muddy colors, but we're going to save it.",
    "Guys were going to save it.",
    "I'm going to bring in some warm glow around the areas nearest to the.",
    "Starbrite silver lining And I think it's also time for me to look at the reference in black and white and my painting in black and white.",
    "That will also help.",
    "So let's see what we've got.",
    "Well, I certainly need to add the.",
    "The light Rays.",
    "The light Rays need to come in, but besides that I think I'm missing some darker areas on the cloud.",
    "Some of the shadows need to be darker, so that's what I'm going to work on now.",
    "Right so down here, little bit darker.",
    "Sorry, my name is super itchy, just having some allergies.",
    "OK, so let's work on the light Rays and this is something that like I can show a little bit of a tip for.",
    "And that is I would suggest for something like this, the easiest way might be to use the latter tools.",
    "So you could use the Polygon lasso for straight line.",
    "Like this and just make a selection.",
    "Well, first of all, you want to think about where is the light coming from.",
    "So it looks like the sun is maybe right behind here, does brightest part and the lines are all pointing back towards that.",
    "So you want to keep that in mind.",
    "You want your lines all radiating out from one place and you can just make some selections like this.",
    "So I'm just holding shift to continue adding to the selection and they can also deselect some little stripes here too 'cause that main area oops.",
    "Was a bit.",
    "Yeah, OK, so if we follow the reference.",
    "What will probably have is.",
    "A little bit of a gap over here.",
    "There you go.",
    "And down here so you can think about where the.",
    "The son is blocking the light.",
    "I'm going to try to get mine close to the reference.",
    "I might be a little bit.",
    "Off I'm not trying to get every light right in the exact same place, but I just want the overall lighting situation to feel the same, you know?",
    "And we want this to extend all the way out to the edge.",
    "Whoops, alright, so holding shift continuing to select more and more.",
    "And we're almost there.",
    "And we can do another goal of this.",
    "We don't have to do it all at once, but I do feel like it's a little easier.",
    "To get them all pointing in the right direction to get a big group together.",
    "OK, so now we have that.",
    "Now we're going to take the soft airbrush.",
    "We have a big selection and.",
    "I got to choose a light color.",
    "And you can put it on overlay.",
    "Maybe color Dodge there's any number of layer blending modes that might work for this.",
    "You can play painted on normal mode, but feel like a layer blending mode, but it might be nice.",
    "I'm going to experiment with color.",
    "So right now I think the best one I found is this greenish Gray green color.",
    "Yeah, this one seems to be working pretty well, so just use the.",
    "The Airbrush and filling those Rays and then deselect it.",
    "So then I have this.",
    "Oh, thank you, Matthew.",
    "Thank you.",
    "I'm not sure if it helps with visibility or not.",
    "Actually now that you mention it, I'm not sure, but I definitely appreciate it.",
    "It makes me happy to know you like it.",
    "Thank you for hanging out with me.",
    "Yes, so we've got these very harsh Rays selected now.",
    "So what we can do?",
    "There's a couple of things you can apply a filter of some kind, like a blur filter.",
    "Um, I've used in the past motion blur for something like this.",
    "It can actually workout sometimes, but I usually what I'll do is select individual Ray groups and have the motion kind of makes sense.",
    "So for example.",
    "I'll select this area and then go to filter, blur, motion blur and angle it so that the motion is kind of bringing the Rays either in or out.",
    "But I think for this I'd rather just hand hand to do the blur.",
    "So like with a smudge tool, just go and blur the edges a little bit here and there and leave some hard edges and some softer.",
    "And we're also going to erase out a little bit what's going to be behind the cloud.",
    "So for example, this darker cloud is blocking off these raise up here, so we only see the Rays after they come out behind the cloud.",
    "So we're going to reset away.",
    "You can also use a mask if you want to maybe be able to bring this back in if you want to paint in a less destructive way.",
    "You can mask this out so that you can bring it back, but I'm just going to erase because I don't think I'm going to be needing the bring them back.",
    "But these Rays are shining through that opening, so they're going to come out in front of the the cloud like that.",
    "All right?",
    "So another thing we can do is use either to airbrush or a different brush and erase out more little streaks coming in like this.",
    "And if you want to match the precise NIS of your other raise that you've done, you might want to use some kind of tool or hold shift to make sure you get a straight line, but I'm just going to kind of Freehand it.",
    "Hopefully it'll be fine.",
    "And then we're going to make a new layer, and I want to paint some more on top of this.",
    "So this was like using the.",
    "The lasso tool to help as a guide, but now I'd like to do some sort of freehand painting, and if you look here there's a cool effect where the light.",
    "I don't know if there's some maecenas so Misty clouds in the air, but the light seems to catch on this.",
    "This area up here.",
    "Little extras, like a little Aurora kind of look.",
    "So I'm going to paint that in.",
    "High risk, you thank you.",
    "Thank you, thank you.",
    "We're painting Cloud Studies from photos today.",
    "So.",
    "You guys are welcome to join in if you like for anyone looking for a little extra practice, this can kind of help with your environment paintings.",
    "Since clouds are very common in the environment, seems we like to do.",
    "I'm doing this on a separate layer which is nice 'cause I can lower the Opacity and see.",
    "It looks better a little bit more transparent.",
    "Before I commit to it.",
    "Hi Dorothy, thank you.",
    "I'm having a good day.",
    "Feeling a little tired today, but.",
    "It's a nice day to chill and paint, so we're going to have a relaxing.",
    "Relaxing painting day.",
    "Alright, so these are my layers, this one, this one and this one.",
    "And I'm feeling like maybe I should merge them.",
    "Let's do it.",
    "I like to merge my layers fairly often, especially when I'm going for sort of a painterly look an I'm doing quick studies.",
    "I'll merge if I was doing something that I might need to come back and make a lot of changes to.",
    "Maybe I'd be a little less likely to merge so quick, but for something like this, will do it.",
    "Alright, so I will make a new layer on top of that.",
    "So I as much as I like to merge, I do like to paint what I am painting.",
    "I like to do it on a new layer so that I can.",
    "Make sure I like what I'm doing before it added to the painting.",
    "I think those are chem trails that doesn't.",
    "Moving lizards keep us Dosa.",
    "That's an interesting theory.",
    "About maybe I've heard some crazier things lately.",
    "OK, I'm flipping my reference, slipping my canvas.",
    "Taking a look will see what we still need to do.",
    "So value wise as far as lights and darks there's still some room for improvement.",
    "I think what I'm going to do is take the The layer and working on.",
    "I'm going to go to image adjust levels.",
    "And I'm going to try to make the shadows like pull the slider from the left, make the shadows a little bit darker an I might also do that to the mid tones.",
    "Just honestly give us a lot more.",
    "Oops, did I cancel?",
    "Try it again.",
    "Give it a more contrast, a little bit more punch.",
    "It also helps because it gives us.",
    "An area to go brighter if everything is so.",
    "If everything is so bright already than the light areas don't stand out as much.",
    "And I want those highlights to really stand out.",
    "Every Wednesday, Dorothy every Wednesday stream here at.",
    "12 so about 47 minutes ago, and that's the same same, I believe.",
    "Sorry for the noise, if you guys going to hear my neighbors are doing some construction so occasionally is a little.",
    "We hear some of it.",
    "If my neighbor a couple houses down since Luckily it's not too bad.",
    "OK, so now that we've made it darker, I can come back in and give more of a bright highlight up here that said, that little Aurora kind of.",
    "Extra highway area up here that we see.",
    "Just really bump up the.",
    "The glow.",
    "We can also use either multiply or overlay and add some shadows.",
    "So right around the cloud here is kind of interesting.",
    "But there's a bit of darker area here right outside the cloud before that later band.",
    "I like this little.",
    "This Aqua colors is kind of showing up here.",
    "I'm going to bring that a little bit into the cloud.",
    "The cloud has a lot of.",
    "Little huge shifts in it.",
    "Nothing too wild's, all pretty close.",
    "But I want to get a little bit more variety.",
    "No flipping again.",
    "I know that's true.",
    "Like there's always something going on.",
    "Construction, or my other neighbor within demon dog?",
    "I'm sorry.",
    "Pretty chill today.",
    "No complaints mostly.",
    "Well, I will say as far as the Creek critique.",
    "My painting or my workflow here.",
    "I think the hardest thing for me has been getting the different colors that are in this cloud without having it be muddy.",
    "I feel like it's leaning towards some kind of muddiness.",
    "What the colors you know.",
    "The shadows of the clouds have a lot of blue.",
    "There's like glue and then it shifts to like a warmer color.",
    "And it seems like in between that shift is kind of.",
    "Puzzle for me, shifting from the Blues to the.",
    "The brownish gold.",
    "Without getting muddy.",
    "That's been my biggest challenge with this one.",
    "So right now I'm just kind of doing polishing like everything's been blocked in.",
    "Just going back in an painting like some little.",
    "Extra rim light.",
    "Some of this.",
    "You know bubbly, bubbly, kind of shadows that you see in the clouds.",
    "I'm trying to go off of what is really happening in the reference.",
    "I really love the light Rays.",
    "It's such a cool effect when you see this.",
    "In person.",
    "I used to take a lot of pictures of the Sky when I lived in Florida because we'd often have these really big crazy thunderhead type clouds and.",
    "It's really fun to feed.",
    "One, if I could find some of those pictures, feel like some of them have just been lost overtime.",
    "Things that I never bothered transferring from my phone, unfortunately.",
    "But Alright, let's get a little bit more.",
    "Polish over here so.",
    "Cineraria little light coming through or catching on the side.",
    "Maybe it would have been interesting or would be interesting to try.",
    "Sort of a one brush challenge for these.",
    "I think that would be tough.",
    "I tend to like to use a few different brushes when I paint clouds.",
    "I don't have necessarily specific ones that I always use, but just the idea that I like to switch between some hard edge brushes and soft edge rushes 'cause clouds seem to have a lot of both of those.",
    "I know faster.",
    "That's a big surprise to me too.",
    "I didn't think there were so many colors in this cloud.",
    "It just looks like kind of a blue Sky white cloud.",
    "Obviously a lot of shadow.",
    "But when you get you get in there.",
    "You're like, wait a second.",
    "There's like all this.",
    "Blue and.",
    "Brown Green Did not see the green coming.",
    "So I feel like sometimes.",
    "With clouds in the past I've I feel like it's one of those things where you could just keep going.",
    "Forever, he could really keep going forever.",
    "Just a matter of how.",
    "Detailed or how polished you're looking to get in that specific scenario.",
    "And we're going to spend a little bit longer on this, but.",
    "I think maybe another 5 minutes or so and we might call it.",
    "Call it done and move on to the next study.",
    "I want to paint some clouds in different scenarios today.",
    "Almost got the Gist of it.",
    "I'm adding a little extra.",
    "To the light Rays.",
    "Here, 'cause it's not just the flat rate.",
    "I mean, if you really want to stylize it, it could be, but there's different amounts of glow.",
    "Kind of pouring out here.",
    "The only problem with painting this by hand is it's hard to get the late raise at the perfect angle and.",
    "Looking straight and everything.",
    "So I'm going to make an adjustment layer, so I'm going to click the half circle icon on the bottom of the layers palette an select selective color.",
    "And I'm going to go through the Blues.",
    "Without Without doing too much of making selections, I want to change the color I want to change some Hughes here shift things around a bit.",
    "Selective color is really, really handy for that.",
    "Let's see how that looks.",
    "No, actually it's like a very tiny difference.",
    "Didn't really do anything.",
    "Thank you, Foster.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Let's try cyan.",
    "So we can really take the Sky more towards purple or towards the greenish blue.",
    "More contrast or less.",
    "I think that's a little bit better for my taste.",
    "It's tiny, tiny difference in Hue, but you know.",
    "I like it.",
    "I'm going to put a layer an overlay.",
    "And just go over some of these glow glow a little bit more like right as it's coming out from behind the.",
    "The opening Yeah.",
    "So if anybody is a painting along, I hope you're having a good time.",
    "You're enjoying your study, or if you're working on something else, I hope it's going well.",
    "Frame ideas super pretty all thank you.",
    "Yeah, I like to do my sketches like this in traditional Ann.",
    "I found that you can do it in digital 2 and it gives you that same kind of feeling.",
    "Little sketchbook studies and it's a nice way to look back at what you've done and so nice presentation if you want to share on social media or something like that.",
    "And it's not too hard to do.",
    "If you guys if anybody was coming in here later and you're curious how I made the border thing is very simple and you can see at the beginning of stream if you re watch this stream later.",
    "But basically I just used a textured brush to paint these borders and then I have the layer locked and it's above everything else so I can if you yeah you can see what it really would have looked like something like this.",
    "Um?",
    "It's kind of funny to see it that way.",
    "But yeah, either could do, but it's kind of nice to look at.",
    "So I want to have this.",
    "Little extra bit of cloud hanging down in front of the opening.",
    "Got it OK.",
    "OK, well I think I'm going to call this my first study of the day and we will.",
    "Continue on because we've got a few other images, but I feel a little bit more warmed up now that one was kind of stuff at the beginning, but hopefully the next one will go a little more smoothly.",
    "But yeah, those are nice sunny cloud.",
    "And we've got some more dramatic ones coming up.",
    "Rainy sunset, dusk.",
    "Ironically, I feel like this type of cloud seems to be the one that I need the most practice with.",
    "Just a regular blue Sky they cloud.",
    "Thank you read Thank you actually programming and it's going well, nice.",
    "Well, I'm glad that we have a nice happy aesthetic here.",
    "Well, it's going to get a little more dramatic soon.",
    "I think.",
    "I'd like to go a little out of order and maybe work on the one down here next.",
    "I just feels like a good progression.",
    "Maybe we can do this one and then this one.",
    "So.",
    "Yeah, if anybody wants to join in with any of these paintings, you can find the references below in the description above and the info tab or in my discord.",
    "And you're welcome to join in.",
    "Alright, I think this next one is going to be fun.",
    "The reference is really pretty.",
    "Let's get it up here on the screen.",
    "This is like I'm ready to set this as my desktop wallpaper, so this is so pretty.",
    "Very like I don't know color cotton candy.",
    "Tropical feeling.",
    "Thanks, gnutella thinks everybody maybe will try a little bit of a different texture or a different kind of five to this one.",
    "I think that's a good thing to do with studies.",
    "Get experiment.",
    "I think the easiest way to start this will be to use a gradient though.",
    "So.",
    "Let's do that, so I'm going to grab again to Airbrush and will start with a gradient.",
    "Clean gradients in the back.",
    "And let's get a little bit of darker blue for the top corners.",
    "Little bit more.",
    "Gradual shift down so we start with like more of a true blue at the top and then we get down into a more cyan colored blue.",
    "Hi honey.",
    "Hi Diana, just woke up and joined Good morning good morning.",
    "Cheers.",
    "If you're drinking some coffee.",
    "I am well, it's not morning here, but I'm also.",
    "I was also feeling a little slow start to the day.",
    "But it's good to be here.",
    "All right, so we're going blue.",
    "Let's go down through a nice purple magenta color.",
    "And then we'll go through to orange.",
    "An yellow at the bottom.",
    "See, you could absolutely use some kind of gradient tool for this, but I feel like it's easier, even as a bit less complicated to just kind of paint it in yourself, and then you can choose if you want, not just the flat gradient, but you want, like a little bit of net.",
    "Or if there's like a place that.",
    "Varies a little bit.",
    "You can just do all that however you want.",
    "What's up with this lighter area in the middle though?",
    "That's where the sun is shining.",
    "I'm going to use overlay mode and let's try just bringing that up a little bit in the middle.",
    "OK, so right now I'm painting just the gradient behind where the clouds are going to be so.",
    "We're going to get to the cloud soon.",
    "Swimmers that down.",
    "So if we're looking at layers back to front, there's a bit of.",
    "Wispy Like a whiter light clouds that are wispy and then on top are these more solid darker ones.",
    "So let's paint the wispy clouds first.",
    "And.",
    "Yeah, it's still very early.",
    "Still very early there, Diana.",
    "Well, good morning to you.",
    "Thanks faster yeah I really like the colors here too.",
    "This one might be nice to try and watercolors.",
    "See how that might differ from the digital process.",
    "Does a Penguin comfy as my spot?",
    "Yeah, it's a Penguin.",
    "I love this Cup one because it has a Penguin into because it's gigantic.",
    "It holds a lot of T or coffee.",
    "So I really like that streak of like red orange down there.",
    "So I'm starting with that.",
    "And.",
    "Will move up through this purple magenta and I'm just like letting my paint strokes we really lose here.",
    "Will just embrace the embrace.",
    "The organic quality in the scene, not try to over think it too much and I'm using the smudge tool so I'm painting in with a brush that's overall pretty soft but has a little bit of a harder edge.",
    "You know it's not not an airbrush, but very soft brush.",
    "And then I'm using the smudge tool to blend a little bit as much to get some last edges and for the.",
    "Background so if I were to turn this off, maybe you can see it.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Where do I get one?",
    "I got this mug from Amazon, Amazon DE actually so I don't know if you can find it.",
    "We need this.",
    "There's no markings on it, but I just find an Amazon D if you wanted to search and see.",
    "OK, so I'm going to make a new layer and try some lighter wispy clouds up here.",
    "So sort of going up into the blue Sky.",
    "And then we can also use this much tool to.",
    "Blurred out a little bit, thank you.",
    "I know faster it's been on my mind set on my mind a lot.",
    "It's funny getting into watercolors.",
    "Lately in traditional has gotten me a little bit more interested in the idea of trying trying Adobe fresco to see about those.",
    "Watercolor textures.",
    "Think that colors can actually blend into each other.",
    "I've only seen videos like men, tried it myself, but it looks very cool.",
    "OK, I'm gonna lower the opacity here.",
    "So I think we've got a good backdrop for.",
    "For the darker clouds to come on top of will just.",
    "Build up to that.",
    "Pick up with you one more light layer and then we'll do the darker clouds.",
    "All thanks Sarah.",
    "Yeah I really liked the colors in this scene.",
    "It's a bit.",
    "Yeah, it's it's like a dramatic sunset, but it's not.",
    "It's kind of peaceful feeling one 'cause the colors are a little bit more.",
    "Playful and pastel.",
    "Sometimes you get those sunsets that are very dramatic.",
    "Intense Reds and there's a different feeling.",
    "We have one of those coming up.",
    "Yes, I'm bringing in some later colors in the middle down here.",
    "At least this much brush.",
    "And it still might not much to see it, but.",
    "This is just.",
    "Step by step process, I think this is the way to go for me.",
    "So we were doing see this is OK, so I was just saying with the painting right before this that most of the time I paint.",
    "Midtones then shadows and highlights.",
    "But this is an exception because as you can see the shadow, the clouds are in shadow are like in front of everything else there, like the closest thing to us.",
    "and I like to work back to front.",
    "So in this case I ended up doing the brighter highlights before the darker clouds, 'cause it just seems like it would be easier.",
    "So there's always like exceptions, even if you generally work.",
    "One way that can be these times where you'll mix it up because of specific.",
    "Circumstance.",
    "Uh my Matty.",
    "What's the difference of affect achieved between multiply and overlay?",
    "Let me show some examples.",
    "So usually I use multiply 4 specifically for shadows.",
    "So I'm going to.",
    "I'm going to put a color right here, let's.",
    "Put a little.",
    "Pick a color like this.",
    "OK, so here's a little Swatch.",
    "We're just going to refer to this, so I'm going to color pic from this color.",
    "On a new layer, we're going to try see what that looks like on multiply.",
    "So this is that color over here on multiply.",
    "If I were to paint, this is what it does.",
    "So instead of it painting on a normal layer where this would be totally covered, I put this on normal.",
    "You don't see through it, you know 'cause?",
    "I'm painting very solid, but on multiply it's going to.",
    "Dark and that the layers of below it, but not completely.",
    "Cover them so it's a nice way to add shading, but without losing all the details that you painted in.",
    "Let's check out what overlay would look like.",
    "Again, same color.",
    "And this is what overlay would look like.",
    "So I use so overly can also make things darker, but it's not as intense As for darkening as multiplier multiplies, like better for shadows overlay can add overlays.",
    "Good for highlights and shadows, but you kind of have to pick the color according to that.",
    "So if I wanted to brighten things up I could pick a lighter color with overlay and if I wanted to darken it I could pick a darker color overlay.",
    "You kind of do a little bit of both and it also saturates a lot, whereas multiply if you check this out.",
    "Even if I go all the way up here and pick a light color.",
    "Wait, I'm still an overlay.",
    "Hold on let's go back to the multiplayer, even if I go all the way up here and pick a light color, it's still going to darken, but it'll just dark and less.",
    "So, overly, there's probably.",
    "There may be better ways to explain it, but the way that I use them in painting the way that they work for me is like I use multiply for shadows and I use overlay sometimes for both, but usually in a scenario where I want to also saturate or put like a bit more of color infused into what I'm doing.",
    "And that's why I use those for.",
    "This kind of pretty though is it in front of the sunset OK?",
    "Yeah, so um, I also like color Dodge for highlights and I also used lighten and darken.",
    "Sometimes color burn I use like once in a blue moon when I remember about it.",
    "Color burn is kind of like it kind of can be like multiply also, but it's you can see it's a bit more intense with the colors too.",
    "It's just fun to experiment with them, You know.",
    "It's really fun to experiment.",
    "You kind of have to get a feel for how they work.",
    "OK, so I'm going to go to one of my textured paint brushes that I've been working on.",
    "If I can find the one I'm thinking of.",
    "Yeah, here we go.",
    "I think this one might be nice for a little bit of a chalky look, but I think it might be nice for the texture of this cloud.",
    "I'm going to try to.",
    "Figured that out.",
    "So we need more saturation, so I'm going.",
    "I'm trying to figure out what this color is.",
    "I think we've almost got it.",
    "What I'm going to do is maybe the same thing is the last cloud and focus first on the shape of the cloud, and then we can look at.",
    "Um?",
    "The colours so there's going to be a gradient sort of effect applied to the whole shape of the cloud, but I think it's easier for us to just paint the shape 1st and then apply the gradient.",
    "Oh thanks faster.",
    "I really enjoyed the layer blending modes.",
    "I do use them in my work.",
    "I have to say like as I've gotten a little bit more comfortable choosing colors.",
    "I use the normal layer more often because a lot of what I use layer blending modes for is like fixing or pushing things further.",
    "And if I if I can get it right the first time when I'm painting, then oftentimes I don't need to go back and use layer blending modes.",
    "But it's not only for fixing the states, sometimes there's just, it's just an.",
    "Easier way to use the layer blending modes, and sometimes it's the only way to get a certain kind of look.",
    "Well at least again within a reasonable amount of time.",
    "So.",
    "I do use them a lot, but I would say if you use them a little bit less.",
    "Overtime, as I've gotten, it's gotten easier for me to like.",
    "Pick the colors I want the first time.",
    "But they're really fun to play with.",
    "Hum softly is another one you should look at.",
    "It's a very good, very popular one to use.",
    "A lot of people prefer soft light to overlay.",
    "I kind of prefer overlay for whatever reason.",
    "I think it's like saturated colors.",
    "Soft light is like it.",
    "Seems like a little bit more of a chill version of overlay.",
    "So I'm trying to get the gesture of the cloud as a really interesting.",
    "Group.",
    "Really interesting shapes going on here.",
    "And then there's some little.",
    "Flip got these little clouds and I drifted off.",
    "And this is an interesting area here.",
    "So it might be nice to take a similar brush or a different brush that also has a lot of texture and use that as an eraser so you can kind of cut back in erase back into the original cloud shape that we made and.",
    "Make some more interesting effects.",
    "That we might not have thought of doing the first time.",
    "Or it might be.",
    "Easier to do it with the eraser.",
    "You get more dynamic effects sometimes.",
    "And happy accidents.",
    "Sometimes the racer will erase something in a way you don't expect.",
    "It's like oh, that looks cool.",
    "I like to use this for organic things like clouds.",
    "Yeah, soft light is also layer mode.",
    "If you go to show real quick so overlay this would be.",
    "This blue coat, well, that's hard to see, so taking a dark blue color an overlay.",
    "This is what you get.",
    "Let's put it on a soft light.",
    "I mean, they look almost exactly the same.",
    "I don't know if you can tell the difference, but.",
    "It seems like on the left the overlay is a little bit stronger of an effect, just like just barely.",
    "Yeah, so people a lot of people prefer soft light.",
    "If you want a more sort of natural, less intense effect.",
    "But for me, I kind of like to just use overlay and then lower, you know, use opacity to decide how much.",
    "But everyone got their different preferences.",
    "But they're very similar, at least to my eyes.",
    "All right, so we're almost ready to do the shading on the cloud, which I think is going to be very satisfying after seeing it like this.",
    "'cause it's definitely needs a bit of a gradient to it.",
    "David says if you want a little more of a technical explanation, overlay multiplies the color in the top layer less than 50% of the full value range and screens if the content is greater than 50%, cool.",
    "So that makes sense.",
    "That's how it's able to lighten and darken.",
    "It's like combination of screen and multiply mode.",
    "50% Gray would stay unaffected.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Hey Makaveli, welcome.",
    "Thank you, thank you David.",
    "OK, so one thing that I can say about painting clouds is sometimes it's nice to use warp tool so you can make a selection, go to edit, transform, warp and just pull things around a little bit.",
    "Clouds often get this like stretched kind of streaky look through this guy and so if warp distorts things a little bit it's not a problem and sometimes it can really help if you're trying to give an effect of.",
    "Something similar to like a wide angle camera view.",
    "I know sometimes you might not want that, but if you're going for that kind of effect you can really like stretch things out.",
    "Anna, that could be really cool.",
    "I think that this one is OK already, but maybe this cloud here.",
    "We could do a little bit more, get, stretch it out a little bit more so you can just exaggerate.",
    "Sometimes the.",
    "The feeling of wind and stuff like that with using the warp tool.",
    "Stretching things around.",
    "If you find your initial.",
    "Version didn't have enough.",
    "Feeling of wind.",
    "Thanks Jean.",
    "Watching John having a purring cat in the lap equal to short nap but sounds really nice.",
    "Cats Purring is like the best thing ever.",
    "Alright, so there's this little example.",
    "Stretch things out of it.",
    "OK, so this is on its own layer.",
    "So I'm going to add.",
    "Some color now so we can lock the layer.",
    "Press little checkerboard icon, then you know we can pay whatever we want within that shape.",
    "So I think I'm going to go to the Airbrush.",
    "And.",
    "Give a little bit of a gradient.",
    "Like this?",
    "Down towards purple.",
    "So it's really nice to kind of do this all at once, like to have the shape created and then be able to go in and do this gradient 'cause it makes a nice move.",
    "Transition.",
    "Yeah, we can even go all the way down to having like a magenta.",
    "Highlight rated the bottom.",
    "Purple, magenta.",
    "So I'm gonna get a warm glow.",
    "I'm going to go back to the same brush that I used to paint the clouds.",
    "We can make a new layer.",
    "And.",
    "Adding some.",
    "Shadows.",
    "The stretching tools.",
    "My Dean I'm trying to have a set of photos.",
    "They simply will not work properly with the warp.",
    "How to get proper lines almost 45 degrees?",
    "This yeah, the workflow can sometimes really distort things too much to wear this like.",
    "He just won't.",
    "It won't sell it, you know.",
    "Um, they will not work properly with work.",
    "How do you get proper lines?",
    "Almost 45 degree.",
    "I don't know if I'm understanding your question.",
    "Unfortunately Jennifer can you try explaining it differently?",
    "Proper lines, almost 45 degree that the party understand with the lines what you're trying to go for, but I'd be happy to help if I can.",
    "Yeah, you're welcome to even share an example if you want to.",
    "I'm not sure.",
    "And one of those people that often understands things a lot better via visual hold on 1 second guys, the doorbell just Rang.",
    "I'm going to grab that, apologize.",
    "OK, thank you for waiting.",
    "One is is perhaps seeking his puppet warp.",
    "Yeah, that might work.",
    "I'm not very familiar with the puppet warp, although I am curious about it.",
    "I've seen some little clips, little videos of it being used.",
    "So right now I'm using a layer on multiply to add a little extra shadows to what we've already painted.",
    "As far as the cloud shape.",
    "And over here Parker did you.",
    "The tops of the youth.",
    "Can be a little bit more towards blue.",
    "The bottom is getting that maze.",
    "Magenta light part explain yes, of course it's hard to explain with words.",
    "Visual stuff.",
    "I try my best, but that's one of the things I really like about doing.",
    "Live streaming is that I can like show on the screen because a lot of times when I try to explain, I feel like I'm not getting it across well enough.",
    "Did you order another Penguin book?",
    "No, although I do kind of need to because mine got a little chip.",
    "Although that doesn't stop me from using it, but it got a little chip on the nose at times.",
    "They did not.",
    "You're so I ordered some watercolor paints an yesterday.",
    "I was like thinking, oh maybe they're going to come soon.",
    "And then yesterday evening I got the notification that they had just shipped.",
    "So I was like, whoops, I had thought they were like already on the way, but they were just processing.",
    "So yeah, I have to be patient and wait a little bit longer.",
    "Right now.",
    "Ha ha.",
    "With photo shop you can have as many layers as possible.",
    "What is your suggestion on manage layers?",
    "OK, that's a good question.",
    "I I want to say first that it really varies from person to person, and that's OK.",
    "And it really varies depending on your art style.",
    "So some people paint in a style or drawn a style that's very graphic and they keep a lot of things on separate layers.",
    "And that's probably for the best for them, because it, especially if you have like line art for example, in your work, it doesn't make a lot of sense to merge the line art.",
    "This clean line art onto.",
    "You're painting, you might need to keep that separate, so there's a lot of reasons why you might want to.",
    "Do things in a different way, and again, that's all OK for me.",
    "I do often go for a more.",
    "Traditional look in my digital paintings and I find that emerging more often helps me to get closer to that look where I want to keep things separate.",
    "I have a tendency to paint more rigid an like keep things separate.",
    "You know?",
    "I don't know how to explain it, but I do like to merge my layers pretty often.",
    "If I'm doing a character in the background, I will try to at least keep those separate for awhile so that you can paint the background and then if you want to move the character or.",
    "Have something going right behind the characters head.",
    "You don't have to avoid that painting on the head.",
    "You know you can just paint right behind it, so depending on the situation you can keep things more separate.",
    "But what I tend to like to do is just keep it separate, as long as it's still helping me to do so.",
    "Like for example I didn't merge this layer onto the background layer yet with the rest of the gradient 'cause I feel like it still might benefit me.",
    "I still might want to come in behind here and like add some more.",
    "Textures and as soon as I merge that down, it's going to be less easy for me to do that, but as I kind of tried to.",
    "Move along through those parts of the process early on so that I can.",
    "I just get things in place and merge them so that I can continue to render the illustration all.",
    "Um, as in 1 one go.",
    "So what I like to do is have one layer with my painting on it, and then I usually make a new layer and paint whatever I'm working on that area of the painting.",
    "And then when I.",
    "You know, I'll look at what I've done after a few minutes of painting, and if I like it, I'll merge it down.",
    "If I don't, I'll fix it.",
    "Yeah, so I tend to work with very minimal amount of layers, usually about.",
    "Four or five maximum for like a quick study and maybe even less.",
    "Yeah, sometimes just one or two, but for a quick studies I like to use very few layers an 4.",
    "Illustrations I'll still probably not have more than 10 for most of the time.",
    "But this is kind of A.",
    "You know who knows if this is a phase, but currently I find that it really helps get my work to have a more traditional kind of look.",
    "If I merge things a lot and like paint over mistakes rather than.",
    "Rather than erasing out and fixing it that way.",
    "But I used to when I first got into digital painting and when I was in different art styles, I used to have tons of layers and I think there's there's a little bit of difference to what I was doing.",
    "Like some professionals need to work with a lot of layers and that's fine.",
    "what I was doing wasn't.",
    "It wasn't really because, uh, it was more because I didn't know what I was doing.",
    "I was being too obsessive with keeping layers thinking to myself.",
    "Oh, you might need to change that.",
    "You might need to change that and it was holding me back a bit 'cause I was just obsessing over.",
    "The idea that I might need to change something so I would never merge it and then I would end up with so many layers that photo shop was like about the crash because I just had like hundreds.",
    "So that was when I first got into digital and it took me awhile to to let go of that fear.",
    "Like, OK, you might need to change something fine, you can do it.",
    "I learned a lot more.",
    "I learned a lot more tools that helps with those things, like for example just using the lasso tool to make a selection helps you fix in an area or copy and move it around.",
    "Um?",
    "Exactly what they've is just saying.",
    "Sometimes people get afraid to move the merge their layers stack thinking it will help the process.",
    "We more flexible, but sometimes it can actually be faster to just cut something out and redraw it.",
    "Yes, yes, absolutely, that's what I've experienced a very very much.",
    "So sometimes just redrawing it, or there's all kinds of adjustment layers, like the selective color and stuff like that.",
    "That can help you edit things without even making the selection.",
    "If it's something like that.",
    "There's sort of a danger that you end up spending more time managing layers rather than painting.",
    "That was definitely the trap that I had fallen into personally, so I I tend to kind of advice against like don't get sucked into that if you really need a lot of layers, 'cause If your art style and Workflow That's fine, but if you're feeling very restricted while you're painting with a lot of layers and you're feeling like you're afraid to merge 'cause you might need to change something, there's a lot of ways that you can change things and.",
    "You can make selections, you can.",
    "Yeah, that's just.",
    "Your it'll be, it'll be OK.",
    "It will be OK and it can often be a lot faster because for example if you want to change something you don't have to go like right now.",
    "If I want to change something about this.",
    "Cloud I have to go to this layer and then erase the cloud.",
    "Then I have to go back to the other layer and paint one.",
    "I want to paint it or something but if I merge them all then I can freely paint everywhere.",
    "Like let's do it.",
    "So emerged everything.",
    "So now if I want to.",
    "Come and paint some little.",
    "Like of this purple shining through like maybe there's a little crack in the cloud here in the purple shining through I can just go ahead and paint that right on top.",
    "I don't have to like erase out in order to do that.",
    "So.",
    "Oh no.",
    "Oh no, Jennifer.",
    "Yeah, it can be so.",
    "I think the main reasons to reserve layers.",
    "Yeah there can be like.",
    "Workflow things or you're working in a studio.",
    "We're going to be sharing files and other people might need to change things and might need to keep something on a separate.",
    "Layer or like if you have a client that you know might want to change something, but that's difficult, it's difficult.",
    "Even so, there does come a point.",
    "If you're dealing with the hundreds of layers where it might be, might be going a little too far.",
    "You might be depends, but I definitely was.",
    "I was going way too far with it and I felt a lot of relief doing less.",
    "So my suggestion would be anyone who's looking to like cut back on their layers and paint more freely.",
    "I would suggest experimenting with that idea, but like not with your client work, you know.",
    "Like do that in your studies and work.",
    "However you're most comfortable and most familiar when you're doing your work.",
    "That's like for your business, but maybe during studies and stuff, allow yourself to try out some of those challenges, like painting on all one layer, or you know whatever.",
    "There's a lot of different challenges, no undo's or whatever, and I don't know it could be fun to do those kind of challenges in your practice work.",
    "But I don't know.",
    "I don't need to run out and do it in the middle of a Commission or something.",
    "That might be that might be a bit too sudden.",
    "Well, I'm having a lot more fun with this one.",
    "The one we did right before actually think I feel like a little bit more warmed up and also like this cloud is very cool from the color combinations.",
    "Nice to work with.",
    "So there's some little trailing.",
    "Little trailing clouds over here.",
    "They haven't gone in yet that I'd like to you.",
    "I also like the idea sometimes of showing the brush strokes a little bit more.",
    "Letting that be kind of.",
    "Stylus pig toys Like it's not going to necessarily be vital photo realism if you're going to show different brush strokes and things, but it can be interesting.",
    "And that's more when going for is just trying to get the feeling of this scene.",
    "Make it interesting.",
    "I do feel like I'm missing a little bit a focal point here, like I need to pick an area maybe around this center area and detail a little bit more.",
    "You take a look at my timer.",
    "Alright, we're doing pretty good on time.",
    "I'm wanting to spend around an hour to an hour and 15 minutes on these.",
    "I'm trying to keep on track 'cause we've got a couple more paintings and one of them, I think is a.",
    "A tricky reference image, beautiful photo, but there's a lot going on, so I want to.",
    "Make sure you save us time to work on it.",
    "Thank you foster, thank you.",
    "Yeah, I think you're right.",
    "The colors look really nice to work with.",
    "So I'm using a harder edged brush that I can get some more details that catch our eye.",
    "Over here.",
    "Same thing down here.",
    "I want a little bit more noise, a little bit more detail.",
    "The focal area needs to have some more complexity so that we have a place that look at that holds our interest for a little bit longer.",
    "That's something that I haven't been paying enough attention to in these studies, and it seems like such a basic thing.",
    "But it's easy to forget.",
    "Often time.",
    "I'm just looking for the whole picture to work with, like the colors and the values.",
    "And does it feel right?",
    "But I really need to work on this particular thing.",
    "Making sure I find an area and make it interesting.",
    "Here's my blurry mess.",
    "Let's see what we are.",
    "It's working on doing the clouds with us.",
    "Yes.",
    "Nice colours leards.",
    "I like those sort of pattern that's formed with your brush strokes.",
    "I feel like you've got a lot of vertical and horizontal flat brush strokes.",
    "It feels very pretty, especially the area between were like different colors are mixing together from the orange up to this magenta up to the purple.",
    "And a little Blue Sky, it feels like.",
    "Almost impressionistic, kind of brush strokes.",
    "Similar size brush strokes around your peace.",
    "Very pretty Lee.",
    "The stormy photo should be challenging.",
    "Yeah, I'm curious how that one will go.",
    "I have an idea, like when I looked at it, I was like, oh, I think I know how I'm gonna try what I'm going to try their like.",
    "Sometimes I get that feeling.",
    "Sometimes I'm just like I have no idea what I'm going to do.",
    "But that one I have kind of an idea, so I'll just see if it works out.",
    "Oh, not for this one euros only because I have some cloud brushes in there that are like I think they will maybe make it too easy.",
    "I need to work on painting clouds and for me I gotta I want to try doing it with a paintbrush is rather than the the cloud brushes that I made.",
    "Though I do use those in my paintings.",
    "I'm not going to use them in my study today, but I do use those in my painting.",
    "Those cloud brushes.",
    "Cotton candy colors.",
    "Alright, I'm going to try a little bit of overlay or color Dodge to give a pop right in the center here.",
    "I think that's something that's missing right now.",
    "Let's try color Dodge, 'cause.",
    "Code that is fun.",
    "We use the Airbrush.",
    "So I have an airbrush that so I got a little bit of fun noisy.",
    "Effects to it, so it has a.",
    "Like a texture that applies.",
    "We could even make a selection.",
    "So for example, if I want to select this little strip of light and then fill that in, that's kind of cool.",
    "We like that.",
    "So little strips where the light might be illuminating cloud.",
    "Something like that little room light.",
    "Oh yeah, no problem here.",
    "Of course.",
    "Oh, thanks Foster, I'm happy to hear that.",
    "Yeah, so for this one.",
    "Just to summarize, we started with the gradient background.",
    "Then we added the lighter like this brighter area that's behind the darker cloud.",
    "And then we painted the darker cloud.",
    "Then we added some.",
    "We just added some color Dodge extra boost, the lighting.",
    "And that's kind of what I'm working on now.",
    "Is adding little extra lighting things?",
    "Oops.",
    "Feels almost like what you see out of the window of an airplane.",
    "Everything moves and it feels like this moves.",
    "Step back.",
    "Yeah, thank you.",
    "I'm glad that it has a little bit of a feeling of motion through it.",
    "Crazy kind of feeling.",
    "Couple areas here where I'd like to get a little bit more of A.",
    "Little more detail in the shadows.",
    "Just a couple more of these, like bubbley shadowy areas.",
    "Oops.",
    "Thank goodness for undo.",
    "Just deleted my layer my whole painting.",
    "Let's say that before anything else.",
    "At home.",
    "So I think this is the kind of this is the kind of seen that I'm feeling the urge to just put like sparkles and stuff in the Sky.",
    "I know that's probably a bit much, but.",
    "We're getting like a cool picture kind of feeling and I'm wondering if we have any brushes that would be good for this.",
    "So I I'm working on a brush that kind of supposed to add a little bit of the look of like canvas showing through.",
    "So down here you can see it a little bit what I did.",
    "So it almost it's like adding an underpainting later.",
    "You gotta have a little bit of that.",
    "Hi Pablo's, welcome.",
    "Welcome welcome.",
    "And I have a splatter brush, so I feel like if we were trying to add glitter.",
    "A little bit of us a bladder affect could be cool for that.",
    "Again, this is just also to help with the whole adding noise to the focal area.",
    "Just having a little bit of these dots this dot texture is kind of cool.",
    "I notice in the reference there's like a little bit of a vapor trail kind of thing.",
    "Coming in from up here.",
    "Maybe that brings RI back in towards the center a little bit.",
    "Make California 9 hours behind.",
    "Need to sleep?",
    "Thank you so much.",
    "This is been very inspiring.",
    "Thank you Lisa.",
    "That's very nice of you.",
    "Yeah, definitely go get some risk.",
    "Thanks for hanging out with us.",
    "Take care.",
    "Well.",
    "Yeah, that's a little better.",
    "OK, well, I think I'm happy with this one.",
    "It was kind of A.",
    "A little bit more painterly effect.",
    "Free zoom in you can see a bunch of different textures and things.",
    "Yeah, I think I like this one.",
    "So here's our sheet so far.",
    "We've got two more paintings to do and I think they might be a little bit more challenging, so I'm glad that the first 2 went on a good pace.",
    "'cause I'm looking to do all four in this stream and let me show you the next 2.",
    "Which one?",
    "Which one are you guys in the mood to see right now?",
    "I was thinking maybe.",
    "Yeah, we're choosing between top right and bottom left, so chat.",
    "What do you guys think?",
    "First people to speak up will decide our fate.",
    "All we're going to paint both of 'em anyway, so it's not a big deal.",
    "But which one would you guys like to see first?",
    "The cloudy rainy day?",
    "Um sort of Moody Sky or well, another movie Sky, but like with a fiery fiery sunset.",
    "You guys let me know.",
    "Close up this reference if you guys are painting along with me, feel free to take as much time as you need for any of these.",
    "Don't feel like you have to rush or be on the exact same pace.",
    "That is not not needed.",
    "I'm always happy to have people painting along.",
    "Yeah, this one went faster than the first one.",
    "Thank you faster.",
    "Thanks you guys.",
    "Appreciate it.",
    "You like top Right Alright Jennifer.",
    "Voted for top, right.",
    "That was the first one I saw in chat so.",
    "Thank you for the request.",
    "So we're going to do top right first.",
    "You know it might be good to get that one out of the way.",
    "I feel like that's the hardest one.",
    "Jane says, yeah, tough top, right?",
    "I think bottom left is interesting too.",
    "Maybe that'll be a nice cool down after this intense one which were about to do the cows.",
    "I will save the cows is like a chill cool down.",
    "Top right OK or sheep?",
    "Yeah, what is it?",
    "Will only few minutes that cows.",
    "It is cows in his cows.",
    "All by Diana.",
    "Thanks for hanging out.",
    "Ono worries mas?",
    "Yeah, we're going to do both, but I was curious to see what people want to see first, and I think it's probably for the best.",
    "'cause this one is a bit of a challenge, so let me pull up the new reference image you guys can find the references that I'm using.",
    "If you want to see them up close or want to get a link to the original photographers page below the stream in the description, there's links to Morguefile Pexels.",
    "Unsplash is where all these photos are from.",
    "You can also download a collage version of the references, which is what I'm using here and this is if you click the info tab above the chat then you can find that.",
    "Look at all the dark magenta in those clouds.",
    "Yeah, there is war in fiery orange.",
    "It does get to like a more pink, magenta, Y kind of look up at the top.",
    "To me, that's where I'm seeing it.",
    "Oh, thank you Charlie Cherries.",
    "I hope I'm saying Your name right?",
    "Thank you very much.",
    "OK, so here's our reference.",
    "I think we'll just get started.",
    "Alright, good luck.",
    "Everybody is your painting this with me.",
    "OK, so let's get rid of our little area blocking off.",
    "Um?",
    "Do.",
    "OK, there we go.",
    "Some groups.",
    "I had a blocked off this area just so my paintings wouldn't sort of like overspray on to each other while is working so the last one that I have blocked is now the left area so we'll leave that.",
    "I will just be painting below that.",
    "Definitely move counts.",
    "That's Cute.",
    "OK, so I might actually sketch this one out.",
    "This is the first one that has a horizon line in it.",
    "The other two that we just painted only have.",
    "It's only a picture of the Sky, you know an for me.",
    "Whenever I'm doing a real a landscape painting it's useful for me to sketch out where the horizon is and think through that kind of stuff instead of just going right into the painting.",
    "So let's do that.",
    "There's our horizon.",
    "It's Luckily it's going to be.",
    "Pretty simplified with a, It's just a silhouette, basically.",
    "So.",
    "We've got something like this.",
    "We do have groups.",
    "Let's choose a better eraser.",
    "Right now I have splatter brush or research.",
    "There we go.",
    "We do have this little trail that kind of go in land here.",
    "Little River, some kind.",
    "If I had to pick a song to listen to while doing this piece, I probably play never ending story.",
    "It's a perfect song and painting that would be so dramatic.",
    "I like that.",
    "Good vibes definitely.",
    "I'm probably going to that song.",
    "That song stuck in my head now.",
    "It was not a bad song stuck in your head.",
    "So there's this little island in the kind of wraps around front here.",
    "Alright, so there's our sketch.",
    "Scan is not too much because we're focusing on the clouds, but it I do think it helps to sketch this in.",
    "Maybe I should sketch that clouds too.",
    "I mean, there's so much going on I'll do a little sketch just to try to get like spirit of it just to try to get the gesture.",
    "So we've got this area down here, which is going to be darker and we've got a big swoop.",
    "This kind of Swoopes all around.",
    "And over here we've got little.",
    "Pendules bringing back in.",
    "More swoosh.",
    "OK.",
    "Girl, that's the general idea what I'm seeing.",
    "Can you lower the opacity on that quite a lot?",
    "Emerging so not merge it.",
    "We're going to put the opacity lower.",
    "With headphones, my headphones working.",
    "Now that's not a bad thing.",
    "It's not a bad thing.",
    "Yeah, I I.",
    "Lately I haven't been listening to a lot of music while I've been painting for the most part.",
    "Of course someone songs in your head is different, but as far as this thing to external songs and music.",
    "I mean, I've been in a phase lately where I haven't been.",
    "It's been a couple of years, actually.",
    "I haven't really been listening to music while I paint just because it kinda helps me to focus better, but everyone is different.",
    "Some people get like hugely inspired by listening to music when they work.",
    "The second one does look a bit like a Sky reflection on a Lake.",
    "Yeah, it's really intense.",
    "I have no idea.",
    "How we're going to do this?",
    "I know what I'm going to do, so whatever I do what I do when I feel overwhelmed like that.",
    "You know, it's just go with the normal workflow.",
    "Like if you're ever feeling overwhelmed.",
    "Just how do you usually start paying things?",
    "Go in that order.",
    "So I usually start with a sketch, so I did that.",
    "Let's start with the background.",
    "We're going to go back to front.",
    "Like usual an I'm going to use a gradient because the Sky is barely showing through.",
    "But we do get.",
    "We do get to see a bit of the Sky.",
    "We see a green greenish color over here and then comes down into this.",
    "Fiery color at the bottom, but in the middle we see like a light blue.",
    "So we've got something like this happening.",
    "Yeah, it's going to be.",
    "It's going to be covered up.",
    "It's going to be kind of tough.",
    "To paint it all in now without any of the darker areas, it just doesn't look right.",
    "But we gotta start somewhere, so let's just attempt.",
    "Going to attempt to these colors.",
    "Maybe I could use a harder edged brush, something like this.",
    "For some of these details.",
    "Under some later pink, I think there's like a cloud of here behind the darker shadow cloud.",
    "Alright, so I'm using this much brush this much somebody's together edges together so we get some hard edges, but overall it's pretty soft.",
    "And this is our.",
    "This can be our backdrop to the scene so.",
    "I'm going to keep the sketch layer above that and I'm going to lock it so I don't accidentally merge it, or like paint on top of it or something.",
    "That And I think it's going to help me be able to visualize the scene better if I block something in for the water right now, because right now there's that area is Gray.",
    "Completely Gray down there, but let's just block in.",
    "So that we have the right.",
    "Level of shadow down there.",
    "How help with the mood we're going to come back and do more details with like the reflection in the water and get little fancier with that hopefully, but will just block in the rough.",
    "Roughly the gradient that exists, which is at least get that in.",
    "So something like that.",
    "And then.",
    "On top of that layer, I'm going to select, I'm going to turn off the layer temporarily, 'cause I want to see my sketch lines.",
    "And I'm going to just trace over what I sketched for the environment for the.",
    "In the land.",
    "And you can hold alt to subtract from your selection and shift add from your selection.",
    "Usually when doing a big selection like this I have to correct a couple times different things.",
    "It's kind of hard to select everything perfectly.",
    "And you could select the The Little Island here.",
    "You could do this like as a separate selection and separate layer if you want, but.",
    "Again, for speed, I feel like.",
    "It's so close there just.",
    "Silhouettes there so close in value and everything that I think we can just do it together and basically make it all one color.",
    "It's almost doesn't matter.",
    "You know?",
    "For the sake of speed.",
    "Alright, so do we need to lower this little bit?",
    "That's better.",
    "Trying to figure out what what I did wrong there.",
    "Yeah, I just going to bring the water up higher basically needs to fill in this River area.",
    "OK, that's better.",
    "Yeah, so do we want to merge those?",
    "I think I am going to keep that layer separate for now.",
    "I do think it will be easier when we come back through this area if it's separate.",
    "So for example like maybe we can do it now, but I want to add a little bit of shadow under the.",
    "Onto the water right near the land.",
    "See this.",
    "Little extra shadow here.",
    "Reflection of the.",
    "The island stuff like that.",
    "I'm going to put a lock change, lock the transparency so I don't have to worry about painting the lines here.",
    "Just go for it.",
    "Alright I will marry merge those layers.",
    "So it's looking a bit flat right now, but.",
    "That's just the start.",
    "And we'll come back to it.",
    "It's nice to get things blocked in.",
    "When did I purchase the sketch layer on to their that was on my?",
    "It wasn't my goal, just wanted to merge the other things.",
    "Typical.",
    "How do I block that later?",
    "But I guess not OK.",
    "Well, just erase it real quick.",
    "No problem.",
    "OK.",
    "At home can be viewing on, so I'm going to make a new layer and let's start painting the clouds.",
    "This is going to be hopefully the good part.",
    "So how should we do this?",
    "I think I'm just gonna grab a regular paint brush and start painting it in this area down at the bottom is so it's just the clouds look very hard.",
    "Let's take a look at look at our reference so this area down here.",
    "Do you see what I mean?",
    "It's very hard and precise.",
    "The edges a hard like up here.",
    "You've got all this soft, flowy's fluffy clouds, but down here it's like pretty intense, so let's use a hard edge brush for that.",
    "And we just kind of sketch.",
    "Get you around like this.",
    "So as I'm sketching this, I'm already seeing that.",
    "I probably should.",
    "The background, the orange and all that stuff behind this cloud is going to need to be more saturated.",
    "It's so interesting.",
    "Before I painted this in, it was like it looked pretty bright back there, but now it's clear that it's not.",
    "So interesting color and value, how it's relative, and that's the main reason that I try to work around the Cynan not work on any one area too long.",
    "While other areas are unfinished or if you have any like area that still the white canvas, you kind of want to at least get rid of all that.",
    "As fast as possible and then you can go back in like Polish the different areas.",
    "But until everything that's going to be in the scene is at least there in a very simple way, it's hard to.",
    "It's hard to.",
    "See how things are working together.",
    "Might sound silly, but how the overcome a fear of a complex peace?",
    "When I look at the reference and so intimidated that it would be difficult for me to not give up really quickly, OK, I can give some tips.",
    "So some of this?",
    "Uhm, you might have heard me say before, but like specifically the things that help me with that is one sticking to your workflow.",
    "Sometimes when you get overwhelmed with the peace when you're about to start it, you just I don't know it like something crazy goes through your head and you just throw what you know out the window and start painting it differently than normal.",
    "I don't know what that is.",
    "That phenomenon.",
    "I've done it and I'm like why am I doing this like just painted the way you paint everything you know.",
    "So stick to your workflow.",
    "Do you usually sketch everytime sketch this one?",
    "Do you usually don't?",
    "Don't just start trying some wild stuff you know, like stick to your flow, go step by step.",
    "That's number one thing, sometimes doing more than one sketch.",
    "If you need to like really, try to simplify the shapes you're seeing.",
    "So for me I mean my sketch wasn't perfect, but I tried to look at like what was.",
    "What is the basic idea of what's going on in the Sky like this is a big like.",
    "Try to make things as simple as possible so like over here on the most basic way.",
    "This all is like one big shape over here, you know.",
    "Like that whole, that's like a one big swoosh.",
    "So look for opportunities to see like the basic idea of what's going on in certain areas and.",
    "For just remember that if you get that right in your painting, you're probably going to be in good shape to start off with, and then you can go back and Polish it more, but try to stick to basics as much as possible.",
    "Thank you, Pablo, thank you.",
    "Thank you, thank you.",
    "I appreciate the nice comment.",
    "And you're right, you know.",
    "Just remember that you can.",
    "You can make changes to what you do, especially when you're working digitally, like try to remember that it's not the end of the world if you make a mistake, like sometimes that's another thing is like we're just being a little too.",
    "The stakes are don't need to be, so I don't need to feel so high.",
    "You know you can do stuff on a different layer.",
    "Try something if it doesn't work, try something else.",
    "Just don't worry, you know.",
    "Just remember like.",
    "It's nothing bad is going to happen if the painting isn't looking how you want.",
    "You can try a different approach.",
    "Of course, it's frustrating, and it's like human nature to be like.",
    "It's not working.",
    "I'm annoyed.",
    "I get that.",
    "Obviously, I definitely get that.",
    "But realistically, like.",
    "Yeah, the stakes aren't that high and in even in a complicated painting you know, just give it a shot and you can always change things.",
    "Alright, I'm going to flip my canvas to the other side.",
    "So we can paint from here, so I'm using more of a texture brush for this, unlike the bottom area of clouds, which is like more hard edges.",
    "This is a little more textured and soft.",
    "Oh, you're welcome.",
    "You welcome the thing that really helped me out was with some of these more complicated references.",
    "Honestly, was just the fact that I'm streaming.",
    "I know it sounds weird, but it's really a thing.",
    "There was a lot of times where I've started one of these studies where it's been a really tough one.",
    "An I think like the fact that I am here live and look over the last years of streaming.",
    "The fact that I'm here live and trying to show my process and stuff, it really helps me like stick to it and push through the.",
    "Difficult pieces where if I had been painting on my own, I might have been like, Oh, you know, in the ugly stage of the painting you might have been like, oh, this is really.",
    "How is this going to come through?",
    "And I'm done with this one.",
    "And being that I'm streaming, you know I'm not going to do that and it really pushed me to like continue more through those those feelings in those phases in my painting.",
    "And it helps you like instill that faith that OK if we do keep going it we are going to get through that.",
    "So having streams that kind of force me through those bad moments was really really helpful.",
    "So, and I know that everyone has that to some extent you have pushed through a painting that you weren't happy with and ended up.",
    "You ended up getting to a better place by the end.",
    "So just remember that that's often what you're experiencing too, and some of these complicated ones like you have to go through quite a ugly phase in the in the process, but it will get there.",
    "Yeah, isn't it faster?",
    "It's such a pretty photo.",
    "Is really nice, really nice motion to it.",
    "Like I make the mistake of sitting down and thinking Alright, I need to make something from My Portfolio.",
    "I'm going to get upset over every mistake.",
    "Yeah you know it sometimes.",
    "Portfolio pieces kind of end up being a surprise like they've been paintings that I started as a personal work and I didn't expect to end up putting you know.",
    "And then I got really inspired and I got really into it and ended up putting in more time and.",
    "Polishing it up more, but there were pieces that I didn't sort of expect to end up being portfolio pieces at the beginning and it just goes to show sometimes when you're relaxed and having fun and not taking it too seriously.",
    "Sometimes your best work comes out that way, so even if it's kind of you're tricking yourself mentally it sometimes it's nice to start these things without that expectation, like.",
    "It's just a quick study.",
    "If it doesn't turn out good.",
    "Oh well, never mind.",
    "We just learned something.",
    "It will apply that what we learned to the next thing that we won't.",
    "We won't obsess over it, you know.",
    "And then.",
    "Yeah you can.",
    "Have a little bit of relief there because really it is about learning and each time you go through that, you're going to learn something to be able to apply it to the next time.",
    "Michael says coming from traditional oil painting the ability to change things that usually in digital has to be the main advantage for me.",
    "Yes, Absolutely.",
    "I really agree like being able to modify things with colors.",
    "The values without losing what you've already done.",
    "There's been a lot of times where I painted something and then realized it was just a little bit off.",
    "Like, oh, I'm going to move this.",
    "I over just a little bit like you don't have to repaint the whole I because just move it over a little bit.",
    "Those kind of things or like.",
    "Slightly changing the colors, there's so many powerful tools for editing your work and getting it to look exactly like how you want.",
    "My Portfolio looks like I slept.",
    "Everything I've done in it like a bottom right drawer of my desk.",
    "Well, you're not alone, you're not alone.",
    "It's very easy to have things be like all over the place in your portfolio, especially if you have a lot of clients client work that you're doing with a lot of different things for.",
    "So it depends on what your goals are as an artist, how to.",
    "Curate your portfolio like just because you did a painting and it's a nice painting doesn't necessarily mean you have to put in your portfolio.",
    "It's kind of up to you.",
    "One thing that I learned was.",
    "Even if I've done a really nice painting, if it's something that I don't want to ever have to do again if I did not enjoy it, I will just not put that thing in My Portfolio, even if I feel like I'm kind of missing out on showing off this piece that came out good, you know 'cause people are going to see that, and they might be like.",
    "About to message you and ask if you can do that for them, and if you really don't want to do it again, you know you can leave it out, so that's one of the biggest things revolutionary ideas to me.",
    "That I got more comfortable with overtimes.",
    "Like your portfolio doesn't have to have everything you can curate it to just show of course your best stuff but also.",
    "Like you can specialize.",
    "You don't have to show.",
    "You can show like on Instagram or wherever else liked opposed.",
    "You can show a little bit more.",
    "Of your versatility, but then on your official portfolio you can sort of limit the things there.",
    "Up to what you really want to be hired for.",
    "That's one way of doing it.",
    "For me, every pieces for My Portfolio Omar.",
    "That's intense, less intense, but everyone is different.",
    "If you're building up your portfolio and or if that's the mindset you like to have and that works for you, then that's all fine.",
    "You know, for me, it works a little easier when I do a lot of studies that I don't put in My Portfolio, because if I knew I was going to put them there, then I.",
    "I don't feel as much freedom.",
    "Sometimes I like to just experiment and I know that it might not come out good, but I still want to try something different and if I.",
    "Yeah, so it doesn't always end up portfolio worthy for me.",
    "But",
    "There's no drying time.",
    "Yes, Oh my gosh, I love that about it till I get so impatient.",
    "So when I paint in traditional I mostly painting with watercolor and Gouache and I do like that wash dries pretty fast and watercolor.",
    "You can pull out the Hair Dryer.",
    "So yeah, oil is probably not for me.",
    "Maybe down the line maybe down the line.",
    "But yeah.",
    "You agree with that one.",
    "Thanks, Jennifer.",
    "And you tell us if I'm staring at my blank canvas and I don't know what to paint, I'm thinking because it's my first one.",
    "I'm kind of intimidated, kind of scared of the cloud pictures, but should I just go for it?",
    "You should go for it and tell a Yes.",
    "Yes, listen, you don't have to show anyone, it just do it to put some paint on the page and have fun.",
    "Maybe like tests out some brushes or you know, just just just play with it.",
    "You know there's all of different references in the art club prompt this time around.",
    "Don't have to pick it.",
    "I mean, I don't think any cloud paintings are really.",
    "I'm not going to say that any of them are easy.",
    "There's not one that I can point out that's like this one.",
    "Super easy.",
    "Do this one.",
    "I mean, clouds are kind of tricky.",
    "That's why we're studying them.",
    "So just remember that and know that you're going to learn something that's the most important thing.",
    "You don't need to share it, it can just be for you for practice.",
    "I'm looking through them right now, yeah, there's there's some really pretty ones.",
    "Maybe there's one that's just really pretty and you're feeling it because the, you know, has a good vibes like this is a nice one.",
    "But yeah, I would say go for it, you know.",
    "And you could, even depending on what you feel comfortable with, you could set a certain amount of time that you're willing to spend on that.",
    "And then just at the end of time, whatever you learn, do you learned and you know if if you end up liking the painting, you can go on with it or post it as it is as a quick study.",
    "Or you just say, OK, that was my lesson for the day and I'm going on 'cause what you learn from the piece doesn't leave just you could delete the.",
    "File off your computer.",
    "Forever, but that doesn't mean that you are learning of it is gone.",
    "You know there's definitely a.",
    "There's like the peace you create and what you learn from it and.",
    "So sometimes I don't like how it looks, so I just leave it.",
    "As a student, I fall into that trap of putting everything in My Portfolio as well, because we have that one piece is what's going to get me hired.",
    "Well, you know, you can always ask for portfolio critique or review from another artist if you feel comfortable doing that.",
    "There's a lot of.",
    "For example, there's there's me and like a lot of other streamers that may depend on the person.",
    "If they do that kind of thing.",
    "But if there's an art other artist that you know in the community, for example, in my discord server.",
    "You could always post your.",
    "Your portfolio and ask people what they think.",
    "I mean, you have to be sort of ready to hear that someone might tell you a negative thing about something, hopefully in a constructive and polite way.",
    "But you know, if you're if you're prepared, if you're looking for a place where you're emotionally prepared to receive constructive criticism, you could post your portfolio somewhere and get opinions on it.",
    "You know, I just have, hey, do you guys think that any of these pieces don't fit?",
    "Hey, do you guys think that maybe you know and get opinions from?",
    "Other artists, or even better, professional artists that have been involved in getting hired at places or stuff like that.",
    "People that have been art directors even I mean, social media, makes it a lot more possible for us to be in touch with these people, which is amazing.",
    "So you could get professional advice on your portfolio too.",
    "If you're if you're feeling comfortable asking and most people are happy to help with that kind of stuff.",
    "From what I've seen.",
    "Oh, thank you far ahead.",
    "I hope I'm saying Your name right, but thank you for the nice comments welcome.",
    "Yeah, that's true.",
    "Public says you don't need to have one portfolio.",
    "It's a good idea to modify your portfolio depending on the job training forward.",
    "That's true, you can do that, and a lot of people will do that, especially if they're aiming for specific studio that has like an extremely.",
    "Yes, specific artstyle strong look that they go they go for.",
    "People will make a specific portfolio for that.",
    "That place.",
    "Ha ha ha ha ha ha.",
    "That's funny.",
    "David says one of the great things about being a painter.",
    "If you're really bad, you're not going to bother anyone.",
    "Now.",
    "If you're really bad trombone player, people might ask you to stop.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Yeah, I get what you're saying You're you don't have a specialization yet, so I want to show my versatility.",
    "It's not a bad thing.",
    "It's not a bad thing.",
    "Some people have very strong views one way or the other on anything in life.",
    "Some people have strong views and they make it sound a little stressful.",
    "I don't know if you guys have seen this kind of thing, but sometimes you be on Twitter and somebody like don't ever do this.",

    "You're going to be able to change.",

    "Like My Portfolio would have looked so different a few years ago from now.",

    "Uh, Lysol says Hi.",

    "Of a cloud like shifting shifting shape.",

    "And you guys get your welcome to check it out if you want.",
    "A psychic changes the shape of a cloud with psychokinesis power, turning it through a square shaped cloud.",
    "Thank you for sharing.",
    "Your son is very creative.",
    "Um?",
    "Yeah, I will go on with the painting.",
    "Yeah, I hope you don't mind.",
    "Sometimes it just gets into complicated area if I start watching videos on stream.",
    "With the audio and things like that.",
    "Sources have had a lot of conflicting advice over the years about portfolios, especially concerning the amount of pieces or fan art etc etc.",
    "Exactly some people feel very strongly against putting fan art in your portfolio, and that's honestly the most common point of view I've heard.",
    "But then there's a lot of artists that I've seen recently sort of come speak out against that.",
    "Saying I got hired because of the fan art, so it's like.",
    "Yeah, it seems to be a lot to do with your personal experience, and it seems like in the end, if you're doing good work and putting it out there, it's just that's the most important thing.",
    "Up So yeah.",
    "Will learn will learn as we go.",
    "But I do think if you're aiming for a specific specific job or specific company to work a specific company, you can look into what they want more specifically like companies that I've heard people doing this for, like Blizzard for example, or magic the gathering because they tend to hire artists with a very very specific style.",
    "So.",
    "Thank you, thank you for thank you very, so I'll check it out later.",
    "I can post in my discord.",
    "Alright, I'm going to turn off my sketch layer, 'cause I don't think it's really needed anymore.",

    "So before I merge the land with the background with the clouds, I'm seeing the tiniest bit of glow behind here.",

    "Before and after I'm going to put that little bit of glow behind the horizon.",
    "David says I got my job working on DND because I had done Fanart.",
    "That's awesome.",

    "You know, maybe it really was true.",
    "Like 10 or so years ago that fan art was looked down on to having your portfolio, but I don't doesn't seem to be the case anymore.",
    "If anything is kind of showing that company look, I can also do this very good.",
    "I can I can do this and it looks cool.",
    "You know what I mean?",
    "Like people will see that and be like hey?",
    "Yeah, it's.",
    "It really depends where you're applying for and and maybe it so maybe sometimes it's luck.",
    "Maybe the right person looks at your portfolio and that was there.",
    "You know they're really into that and somebody else looking at your portfolio might have an opposite opinion, so it's hard I guess.",
    "The best thing is to just.",
    "Well for me I would say.",
    "Research if you have an idea of the specific job you know, try to cater to that.",
    "Otherwise just put in there things that you're proud of.",
    "Things that.",
    "Are relevant to the type of things you want to be able to do.",
    "Like my best advice is, don't put anything in your portfolio that you don't like doing 'cause you don't really want to get hired to do that.",
    "If you don't like it.",
    "Cater your portfolio to your dream work.",
    "And do a good job and then hopefully people will see you for that and hire you for that.",

    "I think it's important to put your still put your own flare into it.",
    "Uh-huh, I think so.",
    "Tiara Yeah.",
    "So I'm working with the.",
    "Some of these software clouds over here on the left.",
    "It almost looks like they have a blur effect.",
    "I guess this is maybe a long exposure shot or something, I don't know, but the.",
    "Some of these clouds seem like there.",
    "Sort of blurred and like moving.",
    "Oh, I'm happy with helpful yoga and thanks everyone for Chiming in with your experience.",
    "Alright, so right now I have merged everything together.",
    "This painting is now all one piece.",
    "So the nice thing about that is I feel like I can freely paint wherever I want so I can come down here.",
    "I would still like my painting.",
    "My painting always changes a lot whenever right after I merge.",
    "Yeah, and then I feel like I can.",
    "Can have a lot of freedom.",
    "Really want to get this.",
    "Shiny highlight on the water and that's the brightest spot right over here.",

    "The whole generalist versus specialist is a tricky one, 'cause both sides are actually sort of correct.",
    "Yeah, that's the tricky thing.",
    "It's like both can work.",
    "And a lot of people, if they've experienced that one.",
    "One thing happened to work for them.",
    "They tend to go out and say like this is how you have to do it, and so there's still merit to their to their experience and their suggestion.",
    "But there's also people that have the opposite things work.",
    "And then that's where it can be confusing.",

    "What's the right thing?",
    "A lot of things can be raped.",

    "If you do, you know if you have started to grow some of the following somewhere on a social media platform or something like that and.",
    "Going through changes in your art that just naturally happened from inspiration influences all kinds of stuff.",
    "Sometimes it can be tough.",
    "You you worry about like how people are going to react to that or are they going to like this is different then?",
    "What I was doing before and.",
    "Yeah, that was another challenge that I kind of had was how are people going to?",
    "No, no, I'm being landscapes more than characters and.",
    "In the end, I think you have to do what you're inspired to do and what makes you the most happy and.",
    "Even if sometimes at the beginning people are like hey, are you going to do this again?",
    "I kind of miss that eventually.",
    "I don't know now I feel like there's a lot of support for what I'm doing or what I love to do, and I appreciate that.",
    "And every once in awhile yeah well.",
    "Mix it up and stuff, but I don't feel a lot of this stuff that I was worried about and didn't end up being such a big deal.",
    "So I don't know if there's a little tangent slightly related, but if you end up changing some of your style or content or things while you're exploring different ideas.",
    "Yeah.",
    "It can be able to intimidating at first to do that, but.",
    "For me, ended up being a positive thing in the end.",
    "Well, we're not in the end, but where I am now ends up being positive things.",
    "Yeah, Omar says I think at first you need to have a diverse portfolio.",
    "After that you can specialize.",
    "Yeah, I think that makes sense.",
    "I mean, there's always exceptions.",
    "Some people just know what they want early on, and I think that's awesome.",
    "I wasn't really like that.",
    "I kind of had to try different things and end up finding out what I liked after after that, so.",
    "A kind of ended up doing a little bit more diverse to specific, like where you're saying.",
    "Because of discovering that stuff.",
    "But if someone happens to know right out the gate, that's.",
    "Then I guess, based capa couple steps.",
    "Stuck between which photos.",
    "I know you could flip a coin or something.",
    "See, This is why I like to have chat vote like I don't know which one to choose.",
    "OK, so I'm going to go back to that hard edge brush that I was using at the beginning down here.",
    "Let's put in a couple more details.",
    "And same goes for slivers of light shining through and put a little bit more echoes.",
    "So I've still been painting on a normal layer the whole time so far, but trust me, color Dodge is coming.",
    "We're going to happen.",
    "This is the kind of thing is going to get some color Dodge for sure.",
    "I know you are, I don't.",
    "I think it's more.",
    "I don't think that's the most common.",
    "I think that it's more common to have to go through this kind of discovery overtime.",
    "Let's pick up very bright yellow.",
    "Pence Maybe I'll wait on that.",
    "David says, I also think if you were a person who really likes doing all sorts of different things, you wouldn't be happiness.",
    "Specialist role.",
    "Yeah, people are different or personalities.",
    "Some people like to have things mixed up all the time where they get bored and other people find that one thing they like and never tire of it.",
    "And it really depends.",
    "It really depends.",
    "I think that's why you have to take advice with a grain of salt like.",
    "Definitely, I think it's important to seek out advice from professional artists and from people that have sort of gone down the path that you're trying to go down.",
    "That's going to make things easier for you, but you know, take the advice with a grain of salt because.",
    "What might work for them isn't necessarily right right for you for any number of reasons, like what David said just from person to person, those preferences can be really different.",
    "Exactly Pablo is at the end of the day.",
    "It's about what you like doing.",
    "Alright, I'm gonna grab a little more textured brush again.",
    "I'm kind of going back and forth with harder brushes and textured brushes.",
    "I really works good to see you.",
    "It's not about that.",
    "A specialist most of the time is someone with more experience.",
    "That's why he's a specialist.",
    "Oh, I understand your thoughts on that.",
    "I would agree for the most part, but I guess the part I would disagree on is that.",
    "Or what I meant is that some people start off always drawing characters, for example like they just from.",
    "I mean I like for example, I started drawing in like when I was a kid and when I was in middle school and high school was drawn.",
    "All my favorite characters from Sailor Moon and all that kind of stuff.",
    "An anyway, some artists just like for example, love drawing characters and always draw them and never get into environments, and they go on and become a good working concepts are it could work in visual development as a character artist who knows what.",
    "Just because someone specializes, it doesn't necessarily mean that they like tried all the other things first.",
    "Maybe they did.",
    "It's possible they did, but I don't think that it has to be that you have to do everything before you specialize.",
    "Some people sort of specialized the whole time just because that was their preference, you know.",
    "From the beginning.",
    "If anybody is just coming in.",
    "Mohammed roller, I can show you what we did so far.",
    "This was the first study.",
    "We're doing cloud studies for part of the art club were doing clouds in different scenarios, this time different.",
    "Like lightings, different times of day.",
    "This was the second one.",
    "And.",
    "This is what we're working on right now.",
    "See I do think people do though Omar, like maybe maybe you're not relating to it 'cause it's just not what your preferences are but.",
    "I for example, prefer environment designed the character design, and even though I like looking at character art by prefer to make environments, and that's not.",
    "You know, that's just my preference.",
    "All thanks claires you thank you.",
    "Far out, yes.",
    "When I stream I like to talk about my my process and teach different things along the way.",
    "So I do hope that it helps.",
    "I can also.",
    "Give you a link.",
    "Give me 1 second.",
    "I can give you a link that has that takes you to a post that I have a lot of tutorials that helped me out throughout the process of me learning digital art, so let me post that link for you if you want some more.",
    "More help.",
    "Yes I am.",
    "I'm using right now.",
    "I'm using my brushes from the free brush set.",
    "That you can download below my extreme in the description.",
    "This one wasn't as hard as it looked.",
    "I'm glad to hear that we are.",
    "Let me see.",
    "RU Super Moody.",
    "All you made it very dramatic.",
    "Check out what we are.",
    "Did you guys?",
    "I'm like how Moody it is.",
    "It almost feels like I mean, it feels like something really dramatic is going to happen.",
    "Like if this was from a movie or something.",
    "Hey Ryan.",
    "Thank you, yeah, I'm excited about it.",
    "Most people that do character design also do environmental design.",
    "OK, let's get back into.",
    "The painting.",
    "Oh, thank you.",
    "That makes me really happy.",
    "I'm glad you like the brushes.",
    "A couple times today I've used brushes from my custom brush set, but most the brushes I've been eating today or from the.",
    "The free one that you can grab below my stream for people that want to try these out.",
    "Hi Karen, how are you?",
    "There's so many layers to this cloud situation is also some more coming over here.",
    "Sneaking in from the side, I haven't really.",
    "Included those yet.",
    "Yeah, all we are the so cool.",
    "Yes, I am using a welcome 2022.",
    "So I have a stylus and I'm drawing on the screen.",
    "But that's the model I have is the 2022 not the pro, but just like the regular 22?",
    "But I like it alot.",
    "Very happy with it.",
    "OK, I think it's time for a little.",
    "Extra lighting effects going to make a new layer.",
    "And put it on.",
    "Color Dodge I'm going to uncheck the transparency shapes layer box after double clicking the layer, so I'm a layer style palette.",
    "Put the layer on color Dodge I'm going to grab an airbrush.",
    "And.",
    "Choose like a warm, bright color warm yellow.",
    "And the goal little less saturated, I want the yeah look at that so it doesn't color.",
    "Dodge just worked like a charm here.",
    "I mean we can definitely push it too far, but it's really amazing.",
    "I feel like color dodges like made for painting sunsets or something.",
    "So we can get more about feeling of this guy being pretty luminous behind the clouds still.",
    "If you want to add saturation but not brighten it, we could have used.",
    "Maybe like overlay or something like that.",
    "How to areas affected getting a little too bright?",
    "I want them to still have that darker, Moody look.",
    "So I'm going to put the layer on overlay.",
    "And let's try that.",
    "Yeah, that's better.",
    "Don't lose the drama.",
    "Hi Ashley.",
    "Welcome.",
    "Right, so if I turn this later on and off, it's getting pretty intense.",
    "Yeah, so I think I'll merge those down.",
    "So this is our current current painting and I'm going to go back to painting for awhile and then we'll try again with some different layer blending modes.",
    "Will see how that works.",
    "I've been playing around with removing the transparency option from color Dodge.",
    "After seeing you use it, I much prefer the effect.",
    "Oh, you're welcome, crazy.",
    "I'm glad I yeah I somebody awhile back taught me a trick.",
    "Making the layer filling it with a black paint bucket and then painting on it that way on color Dodge.",
    "But the way that we're talking about now is it does the same thing.",
    "It's a little bit more handy, so that was like again, somebody told me that on stream when they saw me doing the other way and I was like.",
    "Cool, so yeah I appreciate you guys teach me stuff.",
    "I'm glad it could pass it on.",
    "Do you crazy?",
    "The other image has Seven cows.",
    "Thank you for counting them.",
    "Now I need to make sure I don't leave any cows out of the picture.",
    "OK, so.",
    "The area I'm working on now, I want to come back and paint this cloud up here and add a little bit more bright NIS and a little bit more pinkness.",
    "Yeah, it does look like that.",
    "You're it does look like fire in the Sky.",
    "I've recently sauce concept was really intense like this and I was just like what the sun was really big.",
    "Really big in low in the Sky, very dramatic.",
    "Of course I tried to take a picture of it and it looked stupid.",
    "It's like so epic in person and then I try to take a picture of it.",
    "I was like, never mind.",
    "My phone is not made to capture that epicness.",
    "That's why we should do it in painting.",
    "Yeah yeah man, let me show you real quick.",
    "So new layer.",
    "Put in the black paint bucket like this and put that on color Dodge.",
    "This does the same thing as unchecking the transparency shapes layer, so this will give you that similar effect.",
    "That's an alternate way to do it.",
    "Or you can just make a new layer, double click and uncheck transparency shapes layer.",
    "Then go to color Dodge.",
    "They both give you the same same look.",
    "But it's nice because with the transparency shapes layer, if you want to erase out, you can just erase out with the black paint bucket layer.",
    "If you want to erase, you basically have to paint back in with a black.",
    "It's a little bit more work.",
    "I mean, I think it's not as convenient.",
    "I think you actually thanks.",
    "Appreciate it.",
    "So I want to add these little red reddish highlights up here.",
    "Oh, thank you, thanks Omar, that's very nice of you.",
    "Alright, let's put these little little highlights, but it's almost like sometimes with clouds you get that effect as if it's like the bottom of the ocean, like the sand ripples.",
    "That's what it looks like in the Sky.",
    "That's kind of happening here.",
    "Alright so I'm gonna smudge.",
    "A little bit.",
    "Some of these?",
    "Shapes that I mean just so that it feels like it blurs into the Sky.",
    "I want to make blend.",
    "Oh You're welcome, you can always if you like, forget.",
    "You could always come and ask me like was that thing you showed and I'll show you.",
    "But you can also watch this stream later for anybody who's interested.",
    "If you missed something earlier on, if you want to go back and see an earlier part of the painting process, the streams.",
    "My streams are always available on my page.",
    "There's a video tab and you can just click that and you'll see any of the previous live streams that I've had here and.",
    "Yeah, it goes back like months and months, so there's lots of stuff to watch if you wanted to watch any of the older streams.",
    "A nice thing about watching the past streams is there's the tool timeline feature, so this is like recording the tools.",
    "I'm using the colors I'm picking and all that stuff as I'm painting, and when you watch the replay that plays like alongside the video so it can help with following along if you're like learning some of the tools for the first time, it might make it easier.",
    "Sorry, I'm going to merge these down.",
    "Hi Lisa, my weakness, oh that's interesting.",
    "Highlights are like my favorite part.",
    "I don't know why but.",
    "I think it's just like it gives that extra bit of.",
    "Taz as give extra pop at the end like bands highlights.",
    "Kind of like in portraits when you do the little shine and I at the end and it's like yeah, there we go.",
    "So I'm happy to help with any tips on painting highlights.",
    "This area up here.",
    "I probably got a little too dark so I can just add.",
    "Hello.",
    "Well, if any guys are painting along, I hope it's going well.",
    "We are finished super quick on this one, but you guys are welcome to peak as much time as you need if you need.",
    "People count it past past amount of time I work on.",
    "It's all good.",
    "You can share whenever you want.",
    "Alright, I want to put some Riddle.",
    "Highlights here actually let slip again, so it can be lined up with our reference here.",
    "I want to put some little rim light, like really born orange rim light under the clouds here going off.",
    "Into the distance.",
    "Hopefully.",
    "So all these little darker clouds they can get a little bit of this rim lay on the bottom edge.",
    "You always over do it, I see, so that's the issue.",
    "Hi Lee Yeah, I know I've had to restrain my color Dodge a little bit over the years.",
    "I used to definitely go a little overboard.",
    "Hi Steven.",
    "So you're like last week I saw your artwork in your page impressed with your talent and I'm here again.",
    "Well, welcome back and thank you.",
    "Did he use into Uspro before?",
    "Ah, thank you so much.",
    "I have used the Intuos along time ago when I was first thinking of getting into digital art.",
    "I've borrowed an intuos 2 from a friend and I made a couple of paintings with it and eventually I ended up.",
    "I saved up and got us antique so I didn't work for a very long time on an intuos.",
    "I had kind of a short experience working with it.",
    "But I mainly work on a screen tablet.",
    "I have the Wakeham Centriq 22.",
    "Of course you don't have to have screen tablet.",
    "I found it personally a little bit of an easier transition.",
    "I thought the into us was a little hard for me too.",
    "You know, 'cause you're like looking up at the screen, but you're drawing down on like the mouse pad type thing and it just takes a little bit of time to get used to an.",
    "I guess I was impatient, but at the time I was like you know what this is.",
    "This is really feels unnatural to me.",
    "I'm going to save up and get a screen tablet.",
    "That's what I did, but I've talked to a lot of artists since then.",
    "Have kind of gave me the impression that.",
    "Maybe if I stuck with it a little bit longer I would've been fine with the intuos anyway, but.",
    "Yeah, long story, but I'm using a centriq.",
    "The highlights in spandex, for example.",
    "Yeah, painting shiny paper clothing.",
    "Is really fun if you're doing like I've done some superhero Fanarts people wearing like sort of latex outfit, that kind of thing.",
    "It was really fun to paint the highlights in very, very shiny.",
    "High rise.",
    "How are you?",
    "Alright, let me take a peek at what time it is 'cause I'm trying to stay on track here.",
    "We're doing good.",
    "Actually, we're doing good.",
    "I want to make sure we had enough time.",
    "We have another painting to do after this one, but I'd like to Polish this one up a bit more.",
    "I think we can.",
    "I think we can do better.",
    "I'd like to have this area feel like really soft.",
    "So for me there's like levels of softness and hardness in this picture.",
    "This is like the softest area.",
    "This would be like the next softest area, and then this area down here.",
    "Should the clouds should be like have a pretty hard edge, so I wanna get that variety feeling a little bit more strong in my painting.",
    "Like a little bit more obvious right now it's a bit.",
    "Yeah, the textures aren't so different from each other.",
    "So one thing we can do is take a brush that's a little bit smoother and paint over in the areas where we want the software effect, so I can kind of blur out some things.",
    "Oh, by the way, I forgot um, Steven, and anyone else is interested in information about tablets.",
    "I added a link below my stream in the description to a blague that does really good reviews on different types of tablets.",
    "Whether it's a screen, tablet or pen tablets.",
    "Up 'cause I get a lot of questions about tablets and things and it's a really, really good place to look for information and reviews about that.",
    "So if anyone's like shopping around for tablet, check out that link.",
    "I'm not like affiliated with the Bradley called call Bo.",
    "I hope I'm pronouncing his name right.",
    "I'm not affiliated with them in any way, but I really like his.",
    "His blog is very good for looking at different tablets and stuff.",
    "Oh, don't worry, you know that's very nice of you Steve and I appreciate it.",
    "That wasn't long.",
    "Don't worry, don't worry.",
    "Not bad.",
    "Nothing beats a well placed I highlight as so true.",
    "So through the best part of the painting.",
    "All thank you.",
    "Thanks Mohammed.",
    "I painted the final image in a minimal lazy manner.",
    "Hey, you're still welcome to share it.",
    "You're welcome to share it.",
    "Yeah, once it's uploaded to discord, if you want it, you can post the link in the chat here.",
    "When someone says color, Dodge a small Ross draws comes in my head, yeah, same same.",
    "He definitely brought, uh, some extra.",
    "I don't know.",
    "He he really jazzed up the whole color Dodge idea, you know?",
    "I like how he embraced it though, 'cause there was a lot of people being a bit harsh on using layer blending modes.",
    "You know there's always going to be purists out there that are like you need to paint all naturally.",
    "It's like come on man, you know we're using digital paint.",
    "Let's let's use all the tools we have to make it awesome.",
    "So contemplating screen or keeping my huion H610 well, how's it working?",
    "Do you like it?",
    "I mean, I'm going to screen.",
    "Tablet is always nice.",
    "But the fuel comfortable with your tablet if you feel like it's restricting you.",
    "I think you're right.",
    "Thanks.",
    "Hi Mona, Good morning fabulous work.",
    "Thank you and good morning to you.",
    "Hope you're having a good day so far.",
    "We are working on cloud studies.",
    "I've got a few photo references and were.",
    "We're trying out different different type of time of day.",
    "You know different lighting in the clouds.",
    "Let's take a peek at what Pavlos did for this study.",
    "Well mine is more oh, I thought you were painting clouds.",
    "Are you doing some graphic design?",
    "That's funny, I was expecting a cloud.",
    "Nonetheless, nice color palette nonetheless.",
    "You got me on that one.",
    "Where is the cloud?",
    "We are.",
    "That's true you did.",
    "You, did you minimize it?",
    "Minimalized minimize it.",
    "Simplified it, I guess is what I'm trying to say.",
    "Oh boy.",
    "Sometimes the layers on my previous digital.",
    "Hey Sean, how are you?",
    "Welcome.",
    "I'm trying to avoid muddy colors in this and it's quite difficult.",
    "I don't know if you guys are feeling that, but.",
    "It's pretty.",
    "Feel like it's a bit tough.",
    "To have these overlap but not become muddy.",
    "I just keep going with it.",
    "Other images sensor details is the River resolution that prevents it coming out.",
    "Oh Curious high performance screen tablet having this tablet for years.",
    "You know that there are some.",
    "There are like pros and cons I've heard.",
    "Even though it seems like the overall.",
    "Attitude is that like it's really nice touch screen tablet and I do love mine.",
    "I've heard some people have differing opinions.",
    "Some of the negative things that I've heard.",
    "Are Some people find that they get more like back pain from a screen tablet because they tend to like kind of hunch over it, more like a piece of paper instead of sitting straight up like they would look at a monitor when they're working in the into a style tablet.",
    "That's an interesting side effect that I heard about.",
    "Luckily I haven't.",
    "I don't have that too much, but I guess I don't.",
    "I have my tablet at an angle where that doesn't really get cause the issue for me.",
    "But another thing that I've heard is that some people prefer to have.",
    "They don't prefer the screen tablet because your hand actually is covering part of image.",
    "As you're working, you know.",
    "You will not be able to be part of it 'cause your arm is there, whereas when you are drawing on the Intuos style tablet and looking up at the screen, you have that you can see the entire painting and even when you're drawing in one area, your hand is not really covering it.",
    "and I was like wow, that's interesting.",
    "I didn't.",
    "I didn't think of that, so there can be like.",
    "There can be advantages to the other side of tablet, like the one you have.",
    "I've heard people talk about.",
    "It would be.",
    "It would be ideal if you could test 1 right?",
    "I'm right now with everything going on.",
    "It's not so possible to do that, but under normal circumstances I know.",
    "Welcome has like testing centers that.",
    "I went to one to try out my tablet before buying it, 'cause it's like a rather large investment an I wanted to try it out and see what it felt like first.",
    "Then I was deciding between a couple models so usually.",
    "They have like the one I went to was about.",
    "Yeah, I was almost an hour drive away.",
    "So depending on where you live, it might be more easy to have access to one.",
    "But again, right now I don't know if that's something like that.",
    "Would be a good idea or that it would even be open, sadly.",
    "Is going to go down in history follows?",
    "Oh well, thank you.",
    "Thanks Mohammed.",
    "We art says that depends on how one sets the screen tablet.",
    "I set mine almost like a canvas on an easel.",
    "Whoa, so yours is like I think Max Max.",
    "Greg also does that like I've seen him with his tablet and it's like he's drawing like up like those kind of like it's almost 90 degrees like a regular monitor would be.",
    "I have no idea like doesn't it hurt?",
    "It doesn't hurt your wrist or anything.",
    "I guess it wouldn't if it doesn't regularly with paper, but that seems so intense.",
    "It's amazing.",
    "Everyone has really different set up.",
    "Everyone is a personalizing, their their stuff quite a bit, but it does interest me.",
    "I like to see other people.",
    "Other artist setups gives me ideas and maybe I'll try something like that, but I guess I've been comfortable for awhile with this.",
    "I like a year and a half ago or so.",
    "It was having some problems with wrist pain and stuff like that which creeps in now and then.",
    "An I had to, you know, kind of reconfigure my desk height of things, angle of things and it's it's better.",
    "So I have been like I'm not going to touch a thing you know like it's working.",
    "I'm not having a lot of his problems right now, so I'm trying to keep things like they are at the moment.",
    "Try to rent one, but it's only for corporate clients.",
    "Oh really.",
    "Oh man, that would have been a good option.",
    "Too bad.",
    "If the tablet is more vertical, it's easier to sit, but harder to paint.",
    "If it's horizontal, it's easier to paint, but harder to sit properly.",
    "We are says I'm used to traditional painting, so setting the tablet vertically doesn't bother me.",
    "That's cool, right?",
    "Yeah, David, that I wouldn't be able to do it either, but I think part of the issue is I'm just not used to painting like that.",
    "Even in traditional, I tend to have my paper or flat.",
    "On the table.",
    "So it's been a long time back when I took a figure drawing class.",
    "You know I would stand and draw like that and it's actually a bit tiring like out surprised.",
    "I was surprised, but you know, if you're if you're taking like a 'cause.",
    "My class is almost three hours long and you're just one arm.",
    "Whether you're right or less, you know you've got one arm that you're holding up the whole time, and I would definitely get tired by the end that one arm would be done.",
    "But I think I've gotten the impression that you would be looser with your drawing in that sort of position, which can have benefits.",
    "If you're trying to trying to loosen up with your drawings.",
    "Weather you doing figures or something like that.",
    "Alright, I'll bring in some some more shadows.",
    "These clouds here that have the bright light on the lower end up feeling kind of disappearing a little bit.",
    "We need some more shadows on the top.",
    "Make them look a little bit more three-dimensional.",
    "How fast are thank you, thank you, thank you.",
    "It started know starting to feel better.",
    "Grow more fair.",
    "I like mine like a drafting table almost in my lap at a slight angle.",
    "That's pretty much where mine is.",
    "I also like it at that angle.",
    "I would say my tablets probably at like a 30.",
    "Maybe 40 degree angle, not quite 45 at somewhere between 30 and 40 degree angle.",
    "I'm gonna put some more tiny little details right in the middle here.",
    "We're working on that on the other painting earlier talking about establishing a focal point and putting some extra energy there.",
    "I'm trying to pay more attention to that lately.",
    "Finding one area to Polish up a bit more.",
    "You can get away with the rest of the painting, be a little looser if you find that area that you want to.",
    "Make look really nice and catch our eye and.",
    "Yeah, how many goes great?",
    "There's a lot of artists using into us or those style tablets.",
    "There's a lot of professional artists using them.",
    "You don't have to have a screen tablet.",
    "Thank you Michael, thank you, I'm I'm relieved.",
    "Especially after the first, the first thinking of today, the values really kind of confused me, but I feel like we got more into a flow now.",
    "Thank you for the thank you for the encouraging comments.",
    "Equipment will help, but definitely not make you better artists right away.",
    "Yeah I have a lot of uhm.",
    "Artist I've talked to you that have been doing digital art for a long time, so more this is like the group of people that are have been in professional art for awhile and a lot of them just didn't switch over like screen.",
    "Tablet started becoming more popular and a lot of people have been using intuos for the whole like career.",
    "Those style tablets and I just thinking with it 'cause it's like, why change?",
    "It's working.",
    "Why would why change the tablets or?",
    "Got good pressure sensitivity.",
    "And it's less expensive.",
    "So I mean, if that's working for you and your really used to it, and then I say, hey, that's a good situation.",
    "You know?",
    "I don't know that I'd go out of my way to go buy a screen tablet if I was like using, uh.",
    "Regular pen, tablet and I was really happy with it.",
    "Then I would just be like Hey.",
    "I don't know.",
    "It seems better that you don't have to go through more expensive model if you're doing great already.",
    "But yeah, from person to person, these preferences are different.",
    "I like working this way.",
    "And it it made the transition a little easier for me.",
    "So.",
    "There's these little risk.",
    "So with the clouds coming out here.",
    "Maybe out a little too, carried away with some of these colors.",
    "Hi Ryan Welcome.",
    "We are doing some photo studies.",
    "From pictures of clouds.",
    "Same with interested.",
    "You can find the.",
    "Linked to the photos below the stream, the description.",
    "And we're almost done with this one, I think.",
    "Hey girl, my class who is convinced her it would only be good Anderson Peak, Yeah?",
    "I've seen those kind of those kind of thoughts on things.",
    "Yeah, it's definitely one of those things that's not going to.",
    "The fundamentals of are the more important thing rather than the tools like understanding composition.",
    "Color theory values all those things.",
    "That's the most important thing my tablet can maybe make things easier for you in some way, but.",
    "Those things are the most important thing to get right.",
    "Interesting, we are says, I find I usually get the best results when I use cheap supplies or I don't care about the results.",
    "I know, I know that feeling too, especially, especially in traditional for me.",
    "Sometimes I feel a little nervous about wasting paint or something like that.",
    "If I have some really fancy paint.",
    "Yeah, that's true.",
    "I'm going to color pic from my photo.",
    "I want to check my work.",
    "I feel like I'm having a really hard time with this color, so let's see what it really is.",
    "So here's what I have.",
    "And then let's see their real color.",
    "Wow, look at that.",
    "So the value I chose is like relatively close, but the color is much more like mines over here in purple, and the color is much more warm, like towards a red orange.",
    "That's a big difference.",
    "OK, well that's not that helps.",
    "Alright, so.",
    "Let's come in with that more muted.",
    "Color.",
    "Looking so beautiful I want to go there.",
    "Thank you I know wouldn't it be nice to be like on a sailboat or something?",
    "Just enjoying the sunset.",
    "I don't know when I'm going to feel like it done, but I feel like I'm still missing the last little while this little something.",
    "I'm going to keep working a little bit more.",
    "Color picking is not cheating.",
    "No, we talk about this a lot.",
    "I'm specifically trying to work on getting better at.",
    "Like eyeballing my colors, like looking at the reference and being able to tell what color that is in selecting it for myself, just 'cause I want to improve my speed with painting and.",
    "And we are to succeed magenta.",
    "We are.",
    "Lyrics is going to make everything magenta.",
    "It is a deep magenta, though, you're right, but I think it's funny now.",
    "It's like your color is your color VR.",
    "Um?",
    "Let's see who is it going to say?",
    "I can't remember what it's saying, it's just kind of distracting.",
    "Oh yeah, color picking.",
    "So I'm trying to not color pictures.",
    "I want to get better at painting without feeling restricted, like feeling like, you know I have to rely on the photo cooperating the photo, but.",
    "As we talked about before, just for anyone, you can color pic is it can be part of a workflow.",
    "Trying acrylics woe is way harder than anticipated.",
    "Also work on it for days.",
    "I'm not very experienced with acrylics.",
    "But I did find it a little tough when I was trying the first time to use them.",
    "I was not used to the paint being drawing and then kind of being permanent because usually gouache and watercolor.",
    "You can re wet thing so that was like.",
    "Yeah Kerlix, You seem hard to work with.",
    "But cannot very pretty results, so I think it would be worth it, but.",
    "Yeah, probably pick some trial and error to figure it out.",
    "New mediums always.",
    "A bit tricky singles for digital things.",
    "You know, if you're just starting with photo shop for the first time, it's going to be a bit tricky and you have to get a feel for it and learn where things are in the menus and stuff.",
    "That's a bit different.",
    "The transit?",
    "Yeah, trying different traditional medium trying a different digital medium.",
    "There are some similarities, but some differences.",
    "Photo shops.",
    "The biggest thing for me was when I first started I had to spend some time learning where all the menus and things work, and it's hard because.",
    "There's I don't know that there's necessarily a point in just trying to learn everything because not everything is going to pertain to what you want to do.",
    "Depending on what you want to do in Photoshop Humane.",
    "I mean, there's so many things you can do, but you don't need all of it, and it will depend on your art, your style, your workflow, so it's kind of what worked at ended up working out for me is just starting trying to.",
    "Paint, and as I would think of something I wanted to do I would be like How do I do that?",
    "And then I would go look up a tutorial on how to do that thing.",
    "And so the first bit paintings that I did wear a bit slow 'cause I had to stop and research a few things to learn where things were.",
    "But once you know that stuff then it gets a lot faster.",
    "It's also nice to watch tutorials and kind of paint along with the tutorials so you can pause it and.",
    "Stop and go at your speed.",
    "'cause I was a bit slow when I started out and I wanted to you know I wouldn't be able to go at the same speed of the tutorial, but it really helps.",
    "Things sink in more if you participate along versus just kind of watching like it's a different level of comprehension of the teaching I guess.",
    "I'll paste this link in the class in the class, in the chat.",
    "Again, this is a bunch of tutorial things that helped me out when I was first getting into.",
    "Digital and throughout the years, so I keep adding on to that and if you click on that page, the one of the very first links there is under getting started is a one pixel brush tutorial.",
    "Those tutorials on that plate were super helpful for me and I followed along with them.",
    "I just took you know, found a photo 'cause he does a photo painting from a photo in the tutorial and I just like took a photo that I found and I thought it would work.",
    "That was kind of similar to the environment that he chose.",
    "He doesn't like provide the photo or anything so you know I just took my own photo and just paint it along with it.",
    "The menus are all at the top your welcome David.",
    "Glass armor favorite paints but unfortunately underestimated.",
    "Yeah, I think wash is becoming more popular now.",
    "I think it's like social media is introducing a lot of people to quash that maybe that kind of went under the radar before.",
    "I love that medium.",
    "Thanks Ashley.",
    "Yeah, I found that really helped me out.",
    "And I just don't be yourself.",
    "If things are a bit slow at first.",
    "It's like totally normal.",
    "You have to learn where everything is or where the things are that you are going to need to use.",
    "Should be good to go.",
    "And I'm still like learning stuff now.",
    "So learn new stuff.",
    "OK, I think we are almost done.",
    "I've been saying that for awhile, but I think I'm going to really like end this now.",
    "Not the stream, just this one painting.",
    "We're going to go into next painting.",
    "Do you see the blue in the middle?",
    "I feel it just went from orange to blue without transition.",
    "Or what do you think?",
    "Yeah, I agree with you.",
    "That area is a bit intense.",
    "I was thinking I might use a an adjustment layer to tone down the blue a little bit, 'cause I think that's part of the problem.",
    "So.",
    "The I'm going to use selective color.",
    "And.",
    "This is going to affect all of the paintings on that layer, so let me just copy this one to new layer.",
    "I think part of it maybe not the whole issue, but part of the issue is the fact that I think my blue is like 2 blue, you know.",
    "But anyway, let's make and you.",
    "Adjustment layer I'm going to go to the little half circle icon under the layers palette like at the bottom, and I'm going to click on selective color and then let's look at science and I'm going to remove some cyan add yellow.",
    "As a little bit better, maybe make it a little bit later, so if we do the before and after we want to clip bounces.",
    "I mean, it was vibrant.",
    "But Yeah, I think that that color this color was just kind of the wrong color.",
    "Of people probably a little bit too and try to get a nice transition.",
    "I mean, sometimes you're just going to bring in your own.",
    "Preferences too I like.",
    "I like my saturated colors.",
    "Some of that can over do it.",
    "I do think over here it's pretty to have the blue a little bit more intense.",
    "Let's get a warmer color in the center.",
    "Yeah, something like that.",
    "OK.",
    "Before and after.",
    "I think that's better.",
    "Which brush to use to sketch in the beginning or doesn't matter?",
    "Just pick small one and draw.",
    "Really you can just pick a small one and draw, especially if you're painting is not going to be.",
    "If your sketch is not going to be in the finished painting, then you really don't need to worry about it having like a perfect texture or anything.",
    "But if you want you can download the.",
    "Um below my stream.",
    "In the description there's a brush pack of free brush pack and it has a sketch brush that I made which I really like.",
    "It's one of my favorite brushes that I made.",
    "And it's just supposed to be like a pencil texture.",
    "I will be back here on be hands next week on Wednesday.",
    "I'm here every Wednesday.",
    "But yeah, Pavlos is right.",
    "I do also stream on Twitch.",
    "You can find my discord below stream in the description if you use discord.",
    "If you join their then you'll get to hear all the all the announcements for one of the streaming.",
    "Thank you guys for answering.",
    "Yeah, we're talking about this earlier.",
    "I feel like clouds just take a lot of time to paint.",
    "Haven't found a magic shortcut for them.",
    "The fastest one was probably this one here.",
    "That one went pretty smoothly for whatever reason, but a lot of times, especially when there's layers and layers of different types of clouds overlapping, I find that it just takes Me time I have to.",
    "Now do a some highlights and do some shadows and you know that back and forth kind of process doesn't happen instantly so.",
    "Even when I tried to simplify them, it takes a little bit of time.",
    "But I think I'll call that one finished for now.",
    "Maybe I'll return to it if there's some extra time and I see something that jumps out at me, but.",
    "I think that'll be.",
    "Will be it for now.",
    "I think the colours you chose created a better contrast than the references.",
    "Oh thank you.",
    "You like the little extra blue blue.",
    "I do think it's a nice to have the brighter blue with the orange contrast.",
    "Glad you like it.",
    "Download the brush back but I don't see the sketch brush.",
    "I wonder if you download the right pack, it should be the very first brush, right?",
    "So this is the brush set that I've linked there.",
    "And it should be the Mattie sketch brush.",
    "I wonder if something is wrong.",
    "It should be there.",
    "But I maybe I'll have to re download this that later and just make sure there's not a mistake.",
    "But we are.",
    "It's right.",
    "Any brush can be sketched brush.",
    "If you make a small, it's fun to have ones that like look like pencil and stuff like that, but realistically it's not.",
    "Most of the time you can't even see.",
    "I've seen people get really silly and like use picture of someone's face as a brush and like make it really small.",
    "As long as you make it small enough that it doesn't matter.",
    "Oh, you saw OK, cool.",
    "A vision thank you.",
    "Thank you fishing.",
    "Thank you, Ashley faster.",
    "Just use a pencil.",
    "Yeah pencil pencil looking brush.",
    "Thank you you are a thanks you guys.",
    "Alright, let me see if this if anybody is working on painting along, you're welcome to like continue.",
    "Don't feel like you need to rush, but I'm going to start with the next painting so we'll have our for studies for the day.",
    "And the next one is kind of cool 'cause there's a little different.",
    "We've got a rainy day here.",
    "Is going to be interesting to get that rain effect, and the fact that the clouds are lit kind of strangely, the shadow is like under the underside of the cloud, so that's interesting.",
    "Oh no worries, no problems.",
    "You're fine, you're fine, don't feel bad about it.",
    "Yeah, no worries.",
    "Yes, but we've got some.",
    "Some 7 Seven cows.",
    "That's what I heard.",
    "Yeah kisses and got 2 cats here I I don't know.",
    "I guess I should include the cows so will try.",
    "Will include some animals in this one.",
    "So let's get rid of this older reference we just used.",
    "I'll get the cows in here.",
    "I do have an idea for how to go about this one.",
    "I think I'm going to be using the lasso tool airbrush to get that.",
    "That look with the clouds, so I'll try that out and see how it works.",
    "I think every brush that looks like a dogs face, pictures on spaces of brush.",
    "I've seen it people being silly.",
    "You can absolutely do it.",
    "OK, here we go.",
    "Our final our final painting.",
    "Of today.",
    "Just like today.",
    "All thank you Jackson.",
    "Thank you.",
    "So what I'm going to do is.",
    "Duplicate the other layers and put them on top like what I've been the opposite of what I've been doing.",
    "That way I can paint below this.",
    "The other layers will block it.",
    "We are.",
    "OK, so that's going to zoom in.",
    "On my reference, let's take a look here.",
    "Alright, so I'm going to start since this is another scene that has a Horizon Line and like a full landscape, even though it's kind of.",
    "Like a basic, there's not like crazy stuff going on to field, but still a landscape.",
    "We still got Horizon Line or cows and stuff going on.",
    "Pure F is that a plug in it is a separate program, but it's not a plug in.",
    "It's not actually like integrated into photo shop in any way, but you can have it hover above the photo shop window and there's a link to it below the stream in the description you could take the impression of the cows.",
    "I think that's probably the best idea because.",
    "There are pretty far away, you know.",
    "We're just kind of seeing like little.",
    "Boo blobs little blobs that are cows, but there is not there.",
    "Not too detailed from where we are.",
    "Yeah, I'm definitely feeling an airbrush in for the clouds in this one.",
    "Maybe some wispy textures.",
    "7 cows.",
    "Uh-huh OK, Alright, so we've got our background Horizon Line and then we've got some cows.",
    "And I'm just going to.",
    "Pop in some shapes for where the cats are going to be.",
    "Call Cindy very temperamental in their excluded from a painting that's true.",
    "Yeah, vision, don't worry, I will include the cows.",
    "We won't skip out on them.",
    "I mean I was.",
    "I was tempted to.",
    "Paint it without the clouds I mean, but well, I can't be without the clouds is cloud study.",
    "I meant painting without the cows.",
    "I would tend to paint without the cows, you know, but",
    "I think it would be good to have some practice.",
    "It can be difficult to put creatures and and or characters in the scene.",
    "You know keeping them into right.",
    "Scale and all that stuff is something that I do need to practice more so we won't skip out on these little guys.",
    "And if the if the horizon line was lower, it be more dramatic who that's a good call.",
    "This reference that will the photo is more closer.",
    "The horizon line is kind of close to the center.",
    "Maybe if we did more of like 1/3.",
    "The rise mine was more like 1/3 that would be and we could even do the same with the cows and kind of put them more on the third over here wonder.",
    "Will try it out.",
    "We are.",
    "And the Sky has kind of a little zigzag to it.",
    "Something like this?",
    "OK.",
    "I don't know now I'm wondering about the cows over there.",
    "Maybe I'll give them back.",
    "Seem to to everything was balanced to the right after I did that.",
    "OK.",
    "So but Merge all these sketch layers together.",
    "We're going to put this on multiply.",
    "Lower the Opacity.",
    "And let's make a new layer and maybe I'll try this one in a little bit of a difference.",
    "I wonder if I should try a different.",
    "I haven't done an underpainting for any of these.",
    "So far I've been.",
    "I'm kind of feeling it for this one, especially for the grass.",
    "There's a lot of like Brown showing through the grass on top.",
    "Maybe I will so this is a traditional.",
    "Texture traditional painting technique we're going to.",
    "Paint in the background.",
    "There we go.",
    "Background color or something a little bit warm.",
    "Warm Brown color and then paint on top of this.",
    "Yes.",
    "All this a bit dark for an underpainting.",
    "My little carried away.",
    "All right?",
    "We'll see.",
    "Alright, new layer.",
    "And let's do ourselves in the ground first.",
    "Just getting some kind of.",
    "Start block down here.",
    "So I'm going to go with a darker green.",
    "They're just going to make a little.",
    "Call dad like this.",
    "For grass picture.",
    "My Omar, thanks for hanging out.",
    "Enjoy the rest of your day.",
    "Something a little bit of horizontal strokes, especially in the distance.",
    "But closer to us will will actually go to see like the groups of grass a little bit better.",
    "Paint underneath.",
    "The way or the grass a little bit.",
    "This thing is so many of those little.",
    "Shadow Indentations So often times when I paint foliage, whether it's a grass or trees, Bush is all the green stuff.",
    "I notice that a lot of times when there's shadow area.",
    "That will be more towards like a blueish green and then the highlights will often be more of a yellow green and even though this is an overcast Sky, you can still see it here too that we have more of a bright saturated green up here in the the light and then any areas that are going down towards the dirt.",
    "In between the Tufts of grass that are darker, those are like a little bit more towards the blueish green kind of color.",
    "Well, I should probably work on the Sky before I start getting too much detail in the grass, but this is a start.",
    "OK, so there's our.",
    "Graph.",
    "Amazing how fast the cows are considering their size.",
    "That's true, I've seen cows run had been really surprised by it.",
    "Alright, so let's start getting this mood, you singing.",
    "So we can see that the there's some glow coming here.",
    "Little Rays of light coming down through the rain.",
    "Hello mother ship, thank you, thank you.",
    "I hope you're having a good day too.",
    "I can zoom out real quick and show you and anyone coming in what we've been working on.",
    "Here are our other clouds from today so far.",
    "So we've done a few different varieties of types of clouds.",
    "And now we're doing one with cows, cows in the rain.",
    "Well, they're not quite in the rain, but it looks like they might be in the rain soon.",
    "I know today has been going really fast for me.",
    "Strange.",
    "OK, so here what I'm going to do is make a selection of where I want the shadow to be on this cloud.",
    "And this is where I would consider using an airbrush, but I'm late.",
    "I might use a texture brush, kind of like this vibe we've got going, but you could, for example, take an airbrush and do something like this.",
    "And you could see how that starts to look like.",
    "You know, if you look at the reference, that kind of curve where the light is coming from.",
    "Oops, wrong color.",
    "Satellites coming from up here and you get that curve around.",
    "But again, we're going for.",
    "A bit of a textured feel with this one, so I'm going to.",
    "I just wanted to show you airbrush would probably be the fastest way to do this, but I think I am going to stick with.",
    "This texture brush.",
    "OK by Mohammed, thanks for hanging out with us.",
    "Good luck with your work stuff.",
    "So I'm trying to follow.",
    "I still have blocked off the bottom edge and I'm still trying to follow this curve.",
    "Alright, so let's add onto that we've got more shadows coming down here and following kind of a zigzag, but I guess I'm going to do one group at a time.",
    "I haven't seen these kind of clouds in a long time.",
    "Honestly.",
    "I haven't seen this kind of storm in awhile.",
    "I do kind of like some skip stormy weather like this every once in awhile for staying home and being cozy.",
    "It's pretty nice.",
    "The other day it was raining in the morning over the weekend.",
    "That was amazing.",
    "So perfect bases sleep in a little bit.",
    "So we can use the stencil kind of effect here so I can make a selection and bring the lighter colors down like this.",
    "And vice versa.",
    "Shadows.",
    "All right, and this is our little storm kind of papers off into the distance back here.",
    "Hey, I think how are you?",
    "Good to see you.",
    "Thanks for coming over.",
    "Hope you're having a good day so far.",
    "We are working on phone cloud studies and at the moment working on the nice thing with some cows.",
    "I think I can turn off the sketch layer for a little bit.",
    "I'm going to do that.",
    "I might need to bring it back when I'm doing the cows.",
    "But for the moment, I think it's easier for me to see what I'm doing without the little scribbles.",
    "Mountains of Colorado is one of those soaking days.",
    "Last week very happy for everyone.",
    "Yeah, it's nice also for, you know the plans and everything.",
    "Then a bit dry overall.",
    "Here where I am too.",
    "So happy for the rain.",
    "OK so I will make a selection.",
    "Same idea here.",
    "Actually I'm going to go a little bit lower.",
    "I think we can make that.",
    "Sorry, the cloud let's select the inverse.",
    "So we can make the cloud little bit bigger, have it come down a little bit further, and then we can select the inverse again.",
    "Select inverse and.",
    "Pulled down like this.",
    "To have that rain effect.",
    "It's so cool seeing the rain from a distance like this and there's like stripes in the Sky.",
    "It's also cool to see this kind of thing if you're in an airplane.",
    "Baby looking.",
    "Alright, so.",
    "Oops, what I see my layers.",
    "There we go.",
    "All well, thank you.",
    "I'm glad you're having a good day.",
    "OK, so I'm going to merge this down.",
    "And it's good to zoom out and take a look at your work from a smaller view like more of a thumbnail, because now it's really apparent we need to.",
    "It's easier for me to see that we need to dark in the.",
    "Bottom cloud, a little bit and then the space between the top of the bottom cloud.",
    "You know we need to.",
    "And bring those together.",
    "Sometimes when you're zoomed in, it's hard to get that big picture stuff.",
    "Makaveli says being someone from the UK, this reference feels like home, something really comfortable about Grace.",
    "Guys in green fields.",
    "I like it to like it so I don't know it has a cozy feeling.",
    "And.",
    "You know, living in the Netherlands now we do see a lot of.",
    "Fields of cows and sheep and that kind of thing so.",
    "Yeah, it's a peaceful setting.",
    "Hey project.",
    "Your day going.",
    "I wonder where exactly this particular photos from.",
    "I could probably find out.",
    "Let me take a look real quick.",
    "I put the link to the photographers pages.",
    "Oh, it's actually in Venezuela.",
    "I guess there's a lot of places that can potentially look like this, but.",
    "Yeah, this is in Venezuela, cool.",
    "I was curious once we started talking about it.",
    "But I agree with you on that one makaveli, I'm good glad it gives good vibes.",
    "Working on this painting of the Mills from this week but still have to find a way to integrate the clouds.",
    "Yeah, this is a good.",
    "This is a good week to rise to the challenge of cloud painting.",
    "This is our our goal for this week.",
    "Thank you, I think he can do it.",
    "Could this actually be alpaca?",
    "Well, maybe hold on.",
    "Let me zoom in.",
    "I've no, I think they are cows.",
    "Zooming in on it.",
    "Kmart via welcome back were already thing was beautiful.",
    "Sheep clouds.",
    "Puffy, puffy storm clouds very puffy.",
    "Direct current agency, art studio or independent only, yes.",
    "Independent at the moment.",
    "I don't work for any particular studio or anything like that.",
    "I'm enjoying.",
    "Getting a chance to do my personal work and focus on the stream community.",
    "Doing a lot of.",
    "Like group study projects and things.",
    "But no, I don't work at a studio.",
    "Can look like the Netherlands as well.",
    "Yeah, I was thinking that although if we're going to make it look like the Netherlands, I could make some adjustments.",
    "Up As for me, there's not a lot of foliage going on in the background in this one, but if it were the Netherlands, I think we'd see like these trees.",
    "Like this?",
    "This is like what it looks like.",
    "And then a little house.",
    "Hey escenario welcome.",
    "I'm doing good things.",
    "Good to see you.",
    "Maybe I can leave the added plants, although I think I need a different brush that brush is having a hard time scaling down so little.",
    "Then we can add a little bit of later.",
    "Later color just a little bit.",
    "On top Best human.",
    "OK, I think a new layer.",
    "Now realistically I think based on the reference I probably maybe this stuff that's further away like 2.",
    "Big.",
    "In the references like the horizon line, it does have a tree line on it, but it's so tiny things just because it's really far away, but you know, is our pain.",
    "Seeing we can mix things up.",
    "So let's see about these cows.",
    "New layers and I'm just going to focus on the big shapes.",
    "We're going to do some.",
    "Painterly cows So they're going to start off pretty rough.",
    "Or maybe we find them a little bit, but the idea is I'm kind of going to put little blobs out here and hope that they look like cows from a distance.",
    "I don't want to sit here and.",
    "Focus too much on that.",
    "The cows.",
    "But I want to get.",
    "I want to get practice at simplifying this kind of thing.",
    "So then we have a cow here.",
    "That's like leaning down.",
    "Eating grass.",
    "Let's too light of a color.",
    "Yeah, because of the over cast.",
    "Sky, even the white cows there looking a little darker.",
    "And we can add a little bit of grim lay on the top maybe, but for the most part there.",
    "Got the cow.",
    "Here's looking out.",
    "There's a Brown cow.",
    "I'm going to zoom in a little bit more, so I'm trying not to zoom in too much on my reference base.",
    "I'm hoping that looking at it zoomed out will let me simplify the cows more, because I'm just seeing like a very basic shapes, but sometimes it's a little too hard to see.",
    "So I zoomed in, see if it helps.",
    "Play a little bit of light on the head there.",
    "The arms, the leg.",
    "The front leg is what I meant is that the arm?",
    "Blobs assigning legs.",
    "Cows are cute.",
    "So this one has them as I can get my silhouette because it's.",
    "Eating some grass so it has this nice flow of light on the back.",
    "Like room light all the way down to the head.",
    "That's like in the grass.",
    "So I think we just really have to make a couple of the cows recognizable.",
    "Whoops, I flip the canvas and were over here.",
    "I think we have to make a couple cows recognizable.",
    "And then our brains going to be like OK, they're all cows.",
    "We don't have to paint them all like so detailed.",
    "Now let's get the head over here.",
    "Legs.",
    "Another thing we can do is underneath of them.",
    "Add a little bit of shadow.",
    "That'll help him feel more grounded an environment.",
    "Haha, this referencing the UFO taking a cow.",
    "This scene has that feel.",
    "Oh Oh no worries.",
    "Yes scenario, I'm glad you're here.",
    "No worries today.",
    "Just went really fast.",
    "But you can always if you're interested in seeing what we did.",
    "You could always later after stream pop in the video tab and you know, watch if you really want to see like the process.",
    "Of anything from earlier but.",
    "No worries.",
    "These little counter here kind of funky.",
    "If I can do better?",
    "We will switch to brush it.",
    "Easier to use, this one is a lot of texture, which I thought would be cool, but.",
    "Challenge.",
    "They definitely cows also account 8 of them.",
    "Hum.",
    "OK, here we go.",
    "So 123450.",
    "That's The One I missed.",
    "There's one behind this guy.",
    "Well.",
    "Very impressed.",
    "You're right.",
    "There's 8 cows, although I think I'm going to draw viewers, cows that there are.",
    "'cause?",
    "You know, I think we get the idea.",
    "There's cows are chilling.",
    "Your paintings were done in the traditional way an you rework them in Photoshop or all.",
    "This work is completely digital.",
    "It is all digital.",
    "But thanks for asking.",
    "That makes me happy if you think it looks, it's looking very traditional 'cause I'm trying to go for that.",
    "So I think some of them look more digital than others.",
    "This was my first painting of the day and I used the airbrush on this and I used a lot of.",
    "Like more smooth brushes and then the other two I used more textured brushes.",
    "I think it starts to look more traditional, but the brushes definitely make a big difference on that and this one.",
    "I tried using an underpainting which is another traditional techniques, so I think it's pushing it more in that way.",
    "Came in a little late.",
    "Well, thanks for being here.",
    "Let's get our last cow over here.",
    "We've got another cow that's like a similar pose.",
    "Ha ha ha ha ha.",
    "They should be llamas.",
    "Very cute.",
    "If they could have just like copied and pasted the other one, but you know what it's going to look more probably more natural.",
    "Can we just say the UFO took the other cow?",
    "Yes, that is that is explained it.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Really.",
    "It's unacceptable, they should be 7 gallons.",
    "Oh no.",
    "So like the guy for CSI Miami with assuming in in hands.",
    "Can you zoom into like a fly sitting on the cow?",
    "I.",
    "Some Girls Make into the painting summer left behind.",
    "Try getting chased by a cow.",
    "Oh my gosh, I kind of had an experience with this one time.",
    "I was it was my first time visiting scotland and we were staying with like family friends there and there was a.",
    "The girl who it was like a my parents were friends with the parents kind of thing so I was hanging out with this girl and we got along and everything.",
    "She was very cool and she she took us out to like kind of explore 'cause they lived in Scotland like near a bunch of farms and like forest area in like a really cool area and we were just like exploring and walking through and stuff and we ended up getting to this area is like a big field an.",
    "We weren't like trying to disturb anything, but I guess we didn't realize that they were going into an area where there was like the cows.",
    "Just all started running towards like we were like.",
    "What like.",
    "Maybe they thought we were going to feed them or something, but we also were like running away from them.",
    "Well we got away from them.",
    "We basically went through like a little Creek.",
    "But I don't know what they're going to do if they caught up with us like they were trying.",
    "They thought we were going to feed them or something, but we were also just like Oh my God.",
    "We did not think that they were going to also running towards us, so it's not what we were going for.",
    "Um mattresses, will you do the happy little cloud?",
    "That's my favorite part in the reference.",
    "Oh yeah, good points.",
    "I don't want to miss that the little tiny, fluffy cloud that's right above them.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Will do that soon.",
    "We're almost done with the cows.",
    "Oh, thank you.",
    "Thank you, very thank you for the nice comments.",
    "Sorry I keep flipping over here flipping my canvas and it keeps putting us over to the other painting.",
    "Sorry about that.",
    "OK, let's merge all this stuff.",
    "Hopefully not going to regret the merge, but I feel like that's the best way to continue on here at a good pace.",
    "So let's try adding the Happy Little Cloud.",
    "The little tiny little clip tiny cloud tuft here.",
    "I think we can just do it with a couple little brush strokes.",
    "I want it to be.",
    "I want to feel feel fresh, small little wisp.",
    "Try again.",
    "Terrifying.",
    "Yeah, was very.",
    "I was mostly scared that well.",
    "We were first scared and running away from the cows but besides that we were also pretty scared that we're going to get in trouble 'cause we didn't mean to like trust pass, but clearly we disturbed all the cows and I was like oh gosh what did we do?",
    "But it ended up being fine.",
    "Jennifer says yeah, I've been in the herd to eat situation as well.",
    "I used to be the one to feed off hey off the back of the truck so I think they identified me or something wo.",
    "Yeah, that's crazy.",
    "My friend once told me a story of a cow chasing everyone in their school.",
    "Note But then.",
    "Are you self taught artist?",
    "I did study art in school but post post college.",
    "I've also done a ton more ton of self teaching and learning from online resources and stuff so I'm a little bit of both.",
    "Over the years I did have a background in.",
    "I went to Florida State University in Tallahassee, so that was kind of my education background and then Post College.",
    "I got into digital so all the digital that you see me doing was all learned via like online tutorials and things.",
    "Like that in school I studied art history and my focus was on drawing.",
    "So I did a lot of drawing courses and figure drawing and all kinds of stuff like that so.",
    "Kind of a little bit of both, but the reason I say that is because even though I studied are in school, alot of what I learned came from post school continuing my education and for anyone who is maybe not in the position to go to an art school right now.",
    "If you want to get into.",
    "If you want to get into our even professionally, you don't necessarily have to go that path, and you can learn online nowadays with a lot of resources out there.",
    "Of course, it's always nice if you can go to a specific school and everything, but don't feel restricted if you can't.",
    "And yeah, there's a link below the stream to a resources tutorial and resources page.",
    "There's a lot of good stuff on their online schools and stuff.",
    "It's like subscription model.",
    "There's also free stuff.",
    "Message Torreilles Oh, that's so sweet.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Yeah I workout too.",
    "OK, I'm going to get rid of my sketch now.",
    "The sketch layer on the cow piece.",
    "It's a little bit too distracting.",
    "I think we need it anymore so.",
    "I'm going to go back to the original brush that I used on this piece with the canvas texture.",
    "I'm going to do a little bit more work.",
    "That brush I really like this bright bright green.",
    "I'm trying to pay attention to the perspective of, like the line that the cows are standing on.",
    "Hope it makes sense.",
    "Ha ha.",
    "Reason known for very good wines, in moderation, of course.",
    "Well that sounds lovely.",
    "I would love to visit there.",
    "I've never been to France and it's on my list.",
    "It's like I had plans before.",
    "All the.",
    "You know situation happened with Corona.",
    "Last year me and my boyfriend were talking about places we'd like to visit.",
    "And try to do a little bit more travels this year.",
    "And France is one of the places that was like one of the first places on the list that we'd like to go to.",
    "So it still will happen eventually.",
    "So I like the effect of the painting getting a little bit more loose around the outsides of the painting, and tighter towards the focal point.",
    "I don't think we need to get really, really polished around the edges with all the graphs.",
    "Probably painted out a little bit more.",
    "But But I think it's working OK.",
    "And with really good food, perfect.",
    "So if anybody was painting along with this study and you would like to share your your painting or that goes for any of the paintings we've done today.",
    "If there's one that we've been working on behind the scenes and you'd like to share with me and chat, you're welcome to upload it and share it.",
    "We're nearing the end issue of stream here.",
    "I'm just going to keep working on this one for a little bit longer and get it get it finished up, but I just wanted to give a little bit heads up for anybody who needed some time to.",
    "To upload their painting anywhere.",
    "That you be able to do that.",
    "So the I'm looking at the reference and there's a little bit more of a shift towards of blue Hue over on there, right?",
    "Going to make a new layer Antri Overlay Mode.",
    "And put it on, but the airbrush.",
    "Select the Airbrush.",
    "Let's go a little bit more towards blue over here and I just want to do it lately.",
    "'cause I like I like the color, the Hue variation that we're getting with a different brush strokes and if I apply this layer blending mode too harshly, it's going to kind of wipe out any of the underpainting that's showing through, and it's going to make everything blue.",
    "So just go a little bit lately.",
    "Shut down.",
    "So I'm just looking at the time and I'm actually really surprised that it's so early.",
    "Still, I guess I guess we went painting a lot faster than I thought.",
    "'cause I was planning to stream until about 5:00 my time today and it's about 4:00 o'clock so I don't know.",
    "I mean, I guess it's a good sign that the paintings, paintings kind of went well.",
    "But I was thinking, well, maybe we could sneak in one more instead of ending.",
    "Now maybe we sneak in one more painting.",
    "Because yeah, I'm just a I was imagining was a bit later.",
    "Thank you Jennifer.",
    "It it feels like it is.",
    "It's so weird, like my crazy.",
    "Yeah, So what I'll do is I'll probably just get up to take us quick stretch break 'cause I probably shouldn't be sitting this long without getting up, but I'm going to.",
    "I'll do one more painting after this.",
    "If you guys would like that.",
    "You tell us struggling very badly.",
    "I'm sorry, kind of like trick you into uploading your painting faster.",
    "Gnutella.",
    "I just realized what time it is but I'm happy for your work in progress.",
    "I hope you don't mind if I check it out anyway.",
    "Oh, I know which reference you're doing.",
    "That one is really detailed.",
    "Your colors, your layout, you're on it.",
    "You're going to good start, gnutella.",
    "Don't worry, I know you think you're struggling, but this is really pretty.",
    "The color scheme is really pretty.",
    "Don't worry, you gotta just keep going.",
    "I know 'cause it's.",
    "It's like the early stages, it's just that it's just that typical thing.",
    "I'm starting to number 5.",
    "Yeah, I think I will do one more painting.",
    "I guess we'll just do it on a separate sheet though.",
    "Or maybe we can make another little.",
    "Where were ruining my whole my layout?",
    "Will do it on a separate sheet, so let's see what should we do next.",
    "I've got a bunch more cloud pictures, although I can't pick anything too wild or it won't be able to do it in an hour, but there's some really pretty ones.",
    "How 'bout?",
    "How about this one?",
    "What do you guys feel about something like this?",
    "Without a moon look, the Moon's back there.",
    "Maybe we could make the brute moon bigger, like exaggerated.",
    "Hey Andy, get to see you were doing good.",
    "Um yeah the paint things been going pretty well.",
    "Appreciate it.",
    "It's like a quick a quick snack before coming back, so I took an extra couple minutes but we're good to go to paint some more clouds and thank you for the nice comments in chat.",
    "I see you guys.",
    "Thank you.",
    "I'm happy you're excited about the next one.",
    "I really like this one.",
    "It reminds me of.",
    "Just have Sailor Moon in my head right now because of the recent redraw challenge.",
    "It's going around, but this one kind of reminds me of that Sailor Moon Aesthetic.",
    "Some of the backgrounds in that show.",
    "Oh, and I need to add this one.",
    "To the.",
    "References that you guys can grab.",
    "Let me give you guys a link for this.",
    "So I'm going to add it.",
    "To the info tab.",
    "And I will put the.",
    "I will put the link below in the stream description too.",
    "Wow.",
    "5.",
    "OK, cool, so that should show up and maybe I'll take a minute or so, but you guys should be able to see that.",
    "Do you think the cow should be a little smaller to push them back up it?",
    "Oh maybe.",
    "Well, it's not bothering me too much where they are, but let's try it.",
    "You might be on to something, just need to.",
    "Luckily, in digital we can just test it out.",
    "Without committing, it is nice, um?",
    "Yeah, let's try.",
    "What am I doing?",
    "Selected areas FD.",
    "Oh oh, I see what I've done.",
    "OK, never mind.",
    "Pro shop was right.",
    "OK so we can copy the cows on to their own layer.",
    "And.",
    "Try making them a little smaller.",
    "So.",
    "It does make the scale and the distance more intense.",
    "But I don't know that the.",
    "I don't know that the original 1 looks wrong.",
    "I think.",
    "I guess it could go either way.",
    "I think part of the issue that throws things off here is the trees that I added in the background.",
    "I'm trying to think of the cows in scale with those trees because I think I made those two big I kind of went off the reference.",
    "That always confuses things when you go off the reference.",
    "Sometimes it works out better than other times.",
    "Speaking of Sailor Moon, I started sketching for the challenge yesterday when I was having my heart block.",
    "Oh wow, that's impressive.",
    "Usually that like it's hard sometimes to start something new when you're having that so.",
    "I'm glad to hear that you like push through and and started your sketch.",
    "Here's my thumbs, could use a lot of work.",
    "Let me see.",
    "Oh nice, this is good pablos Yeah, you got the feeling of the environment.",
    "The bright green, the overcast feeling, but that light, bright light shining through.",
    "I think your lightings actually working really well so far.",
    "Yeah, if you want to keep going with it, I think I think that woman will end up turning out real nice.",
    "Definitely good work in progress.",
    "OK, I'm going to put my reference up here do.",
    "Like we did with the last one.",
    "I feel like this one.",
    "I hope it's going to go smoothly, but I'm like kind of wondering kind of wondering about this one.",
    "That's going to go.",
    "OK.",
    "Trying to add back Grainger to the Sky, Yeah?",
    "I think I should have gone so experimental with the foliage, 'cause I think that definitely changed the scale.",
    "I think.",
    "I think that might be the bigger problem, at least to me.",
    "That's what standing out.",
    "But Yeah, I understand what you mean.",
    "OK.",
    "Hum.",
    "I'm going to just save this art club cloud two.",
    "Technically 5 but.",
    "No.",
    "OK, so here we go.",
    "We're going to do one last one and it will be about an hour.",
    "And let's just see what we can do in that time.",
    "So my favorite thing about this, well, of course the colors right there is the cotton candy kind of colors.",
    "But yeah, this this move gradient gives a really nice feeling, so I'm going to start with that and I'll just use the Airbrush.",
    "I want to experiment with something.",
    "So we're going to keep shifting.",
    "Maybe I work in the future, now I'm trying to finish a 3D animation on making oh cool.",
    "Well, I hope that goes well.",
    "3D animation.",
    "What are you using for the animation?",
    "If you don't mind me asking, are you doing that in photo shop or something else?",
    "But good luck.",
    "So we get all the way down to like a light peachy color down here.",
    "I don't like Facebook hobby shake it.",
    "Yeah, sometimes it takes time to refine things from the Blobby stage.",
    "Thinking of huge shifting this a little bit.",
    "Wow, that's so interesting.",
    "What happens?",
    "Well, OK, OK, I'll stop.",
    "Why is that so entertaining though?",
    "OK, let's go a little bit of the cyan blue.",
    "Here.",
    "Alright, well I think that's a good start with the gradient.",
    "So what I wanted to experiment with is one of the things that are really enjoyed doing lately is having more of a traditional feeling to my digital work.",
    "However, there's certain things that I find it a lot easier doing with like the Airbrush for example, like creating this gradient, I think is a lot smoother and prettier than if I would try to do it with some textured brushes, or at least I would have to work at it along time to get it to a point that I think looks nice.",
    "Otherwise it would be not smooth.",
    "You know the gradient wouldn't go nicely.",
    "But I was thinking of maybe trying.",
    "To add some texture after the fact to this and then go on from there.",
    "Maybe that's something I can do.",
    "So.",
    "Giving the impression as if I've done more of an underpainting or something like that.",
    "So I have this brush that I was working on to try to give that look.",
    "Language find out in a little bit and maybe also erase out in some areas where it's too much.",
    "Let me choose a textured eraser.",
    "Which is kind of give the add texture rather than paint it in with the texture.",
    "Originally you can also just take.",
    "Textured brushes and paint on top of it and try to add some texture that way.",
    "Like to kind of go over the gradient like this.",
    "But still, having started with the digital gradient.",
    "Using Cinema 4D and then assemble in after effects.",
    "Can rendered all at once 'cause it takes 10 hours.",
    "Oh my gosh.",
    "Well, thanks no ship.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Yeah, I think it's kinda cool.",
    "Well, let's see how it goes though.",
    "We're getting a little fuzzy here.",
    "That's not really what I want.",
    "You can also just so much things back into blurry state.",
    "So let's try painting some clouds and I'm going to use.",
    "He sort of rough textured brush to start off with maybe will refine from there, but I think these kind of brushes are fun.",
    "They're very, they're pretty.",
    "It's an interesting combination 'cause they're very digital looking.",
    "If you look closely, but sometimes at a first glance they can look very traditional blue.",
    "Thank you, Jackson.",
    "This is one of my brushes.",
    "I'm glad you like it.",
    "So just get a little.",
    "So this is going to be a little tricky, so the one for the clouds that are lower than we have to go with a darker color.",
    "I think what I'm going to do is I'm not going to worry about the color too much right now like we were talking about earlier.",
    "I'm going to.",
    "Just paint in choosing a color that I can see.",
    "So like this one is lighter 'cause I can see against the dark background.",
    "This is a darker colors 'cause I can see it against the light background, but other than that these colors aren't so important.",
    "Once I get the shapes in then we're going to apply a gradients over top of it.",
    "An improved the colors and everything.",
    "And make it more smooth.",
    "Cool.",
    "Down here this is interesting is like a big.",
    "Chunky cloud.",
    "And then there's like little areas that kind of branch off.",
    "It almost looks like a puzzle fitting together.",
    "There's these little spaces in between the cloud groups.",
    "Not sure what's the best way to go about this, but.",
    "We'll just start and maybe erase out.",
    "Hey hidden tides, nice Congrats.",
    "So it feels good to get stuff up to date.",
    "I always feel very happy whenever I finally updates my my pages.",
    "Needing to post some things lately.",
    "Falling behind a little bit.",
    "OK, well this is a start, so this is all in one layer so I can lock the transparency.",
    "Press little checkerboard icon and then anything I paint will only affect at this layer so.",
    "We could take an airbrush.",
    "We could take any brush and just start painting on top of.",
    "On top of this.",
    "So I like these shadows, there's like a.",
    "Purple magenta shadow over here.",
    "So I'm going to try to look at the big picture, so I'm going to try not to zoom in yet and start painting little details things, but I'm just going to notice that there's a warmer, almost Brown orange kind of pinky color.",
    "Thing from below.",
    "Remind me of River stones cuddling up together.",
    "I like that comparison.",
    "Yeah, they do seem to be like almost a little bit grounded and kind of just snuggled up together.",
    "Alright, so.",
    "Get a later pink.",
    "Up here So I think I'm doing one thing at a time with the shape and then the shading.",
    "This really helped.",
    "That's been my thing, my way of simplifying the clouds today.",
    "Spending one thing at a time with that.",
    "Alright, let's flip this.",
    "So we got a long way to go here.",
    "I mean, as far as we've got a lot of steps to do left for this to start looking pretty, we got somebody colors happening at the start.",
    "Because he hidden Mickey.",
    "I think I see her to make you too.",
    "It's like a hidden Mickey in perspective.",
    "But here.",
    "See, I'm going to use a brush from the free brush that I have below.",
    "It's called soft.",
    "Pastel, soft, fluffy and this is actually.",
    "This is one of my favorite brushes for painting clouds.",
    "I did not create this brush but I really love it for clouds.",
    "It's got a really nice soft kind of dissolving feeling to it.",
    "With a pretty texture.",
    "So right now I'm painting in blueish purple.",
    "Um?",
    "Well, it's kind of shadow.",
    "It's not the latest part.",
    "All the highlights are those glowy pink Peach color, so this is still a shadowed part of the cloud.",
    "But I guess it has a lot of blue bounce light from the Sky.",
    "So it's a nice color.",
    "Love and uploaded on it, but at least it's updated enough.",
    "Oh yeah, yeah yeah, yeah.",
    "Well, that's good.",
    "Yeah, like when you log in and then they have like your.",
    "You know information from years ago where groups.",
    "I'm looking at where the shadows are.",
    "Where the highlights are, the light is clearly coming from this direction.",
    "So we've got the one right here.",
    "Ah.",
    "That's so cool, Jennifer.",
    "Yeah, once you start noticing hidden mchughs it doesn't end, then you're always going to notice hidden mickeys everywhere.",
    "It's really funny.",
    "Where you find them.",
    "As you're using the cooler is 2.5 color wheel.",
    "Is it compatible with the latest version of photo shop?",
    "It is why this choice.",
    "The integrated one is not enough.",
    "OK, so I'll tell you my thought process behind this.",
    "First of all I I purchased Clarissa before Photoshop, had an integrated color wheel.",
    "In case anybody doesn't know if you have Photoshop CC 2019 or any more recent versions, so 2020 etc, then you can go to window color and you can find this color wheel you might be on default, you might be on Hue Cube or something like that, but you can just go to the drop down and select color wheel.",
    "So if you have like an older version of photo shop or.",
    "Yeah, you might have.",
    "You might not have this color wheel and so when I bought Coulouris it was actually a few years ago.",
    "Now is like three or four years ago and.",
    "This wasn't available in photo shop, so that was the main reason I bought it was because I prefer the.",
    "Triangle format.",
    "The reason I still use it now instead of just using only the photo shop one is I slightly prefer the interface.",
    "It does have extra features like gamut, masks and things, but to be honest I I rarely ever use them, but I like the how it shows the foreground color very large.",
    "And since I already paid for it and I already have it, even even just a tiny little preference, I might as well just use this one.",
    "But I'd like that it's a larger foreground color, and I yeah, that's simple.",
    "That's basically it, like, so it's nice to have, but I don't know if I necessary.",
    "I don't know if I would have bought it now that there is one in Photoshop, but it's like, you know, I already have it so.",
    "But some people might like to use all the other features that it has.",
    "I haven't properly explored them.",
    "The gamut masks and things I don't tend to like working in a limited color palette, like sometimes my paintings end up looking a little bit like there's limited palette, but that's just kind of by chance because I happened to.",
    "Gravitate to certain colors.",
    "When I was painting but I kind of like to have all the colors available.",
    "I don't necessarily like to paint with that feeling of being restricted from the beginning.",
    "Yeah, so there's my little back story of why.",
    "Why you but?",
    "There is a coupon code for it below the stream in the description if you if anybody finds that they would prefer to have that and you want to check it out, there's a coupon code there.",
    "So I think I'm going to just merge all these layers.",
    "Because we're trying to kind of paint quickly here, since this is our last painting of the day, were speaking in an extra 1.",
    "So usually I find that I paint a little quicker when I merge instead of like sort of going back and forth between layers and it's a bit more tedious, so I'm just going to paint freely here, and maybe that'll.",
    "Thanks be to process.",
    "Oh, you're welcome.",
    "One of the big reasons of using Krita is from the colors will layouts?",
    "Do they also have a triangle color wheel?",
    "It's funny alot of people prefer the triangle and then there's other people that prefer the Hue Cube.",
    "The classic way, and so I guess it's just really like a lot of personal preference thing.",
    "But I like that it's now an option.",
    "You know?",
    "I think that's the best.",
    "'cause then whatever you prefer you can just switch it.",
    "Or if you change your mind you can switch it and it's like.",
    "You know why not?",
    "So my clouds are looking at it.",
    "Um?",
    "Not quite like clouds yet at the bottom here.",
    "It's gonna keep going until it makes sense.",
    "I'm trying to sneak in these little.",
    "Spaces in between the clouds.",
    "Some of them got painted out.",
    "So just color picking from the Sky.",
    "And bringing little little slivers of Sky back in.",
    "Just looking at where my colors are a little different like this.",
    "I think maybe if I went a little bit more towards pink like the red that I have down here is able to read we go more towards pink would be more cohesive.",
    "We're getting a little muddy here.",
    "Alright, I'm going to switch gears.",
    "I'm going to try different.",
    "Different take here.",
    "From moving through brush that similar to the Airbrush.",
    "A little bit soft looks like this.",
    "And I'm trying to try to paint back a bit of the softness down here.",
    "Trying not to be.",
    "Afraid of painting over what I've done already.",
    "I try to I try with these studies to have that mindset like something needs to change.",
    "Just paint over it.",
    "No need to get too attached to any part of the painting so it's easy to have happen.",
    "Give the perspective of it the from the parts, shadow highlight and mid tone.",
    "How cool.",
    "Yeah, I know there's a bunch of different plugins, but I've had recommended to me.",
    "There's one called chameleon.",
    "Well, there's different plugins that are interesting for.",
    "Helping you with your color palettes and organizing Swatch is and all kinds of things like that.",
    "Maybe I'll eventually looking for that stuff more.",
    "Doesn't have sound right?",
    "Let me see.",
    "Oh cool ha.",
    "The animation I'm working on, I don't remember what you said it was for.",
    "If he did say anything.",
    "This is pretty cool though.",
    "So I could stare at this for way too long.",
    "Gnutella I think in a break and I'll come back tomorrow.",
    "Come back to it tomorrow.",
    "Also I love how soft your painting is.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Thank you, let me check yours out.",
    "Yeah, how are you I feel like this is improved a lot since the work in progress he sent.",
    "That was only a few minutes ago, so I'm not sure what you did but.",
    "It looks like maybe a lot in this area.",
    "But this is so pretty.",
    "This glow is definitely feeling the sunlight.",
    "Very pretty.",
    "Yeah, I'm feeling a bit.",
    "Like I'm in slightly.",
    "Yeah that stage and mine really.",
    "How am I going to get to the end from here?",
    "You know, that feeling, feeling that a little bit at the moment?",
    "But usually all that means is we just gotta keep painting.",
    "We just gotta keep going.",
    "Will get there.",
    "So I'm going to paint in from.",
    "Pink in Sky again.",
    "Haha got stuck in the Pinterest.",
    "Hold color pallet boards no.",
    "Oh my gosh, that's like it's like looking for reference images or something like that and you end up just looking at images for hours.",
    "Oh my God, I was just trying to find one picture and now five hours later.",
    "All thanks Foster.",
    "You're right.",
    "Holy cow see this is this is what I needed to do 'cause I picked so many pictures for Art Club.",
    "This was the only way I was going to do it.",
    "Alright, I'm going to put a new layer on overlay mode and grab an airbrush because I'm feeling like I want more warm like towards.",
    "Funny color down here.",
    "You see what I'm missing?",
    "201 softly, I was like, why is it not intense?",
    "Overlay over the.",
    "OK.",
    "There we go.",
    "I want more sunny feeling from below.",
    "Finished my first map crunch one brush study.",
    "Wasn't a big fan of it in the end.",
    "That's a really tough thing to do.",
    "I think you probably learned alot.",
    "What do you think?",
    "I would imagine that you that you learn even if you didn't look up how the painting looks.",
    "That's a really good study to try.",
    "Alright, so we want a couple places that we have like a really really bright light hitting.",
    "So I wanna make sure I get those, then we're probably going to come back and give a little bit of color Dodge.",
    "Come to those areas.",
    "Oh Edward Oh, thank you.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Well, I hope you're doing well, even if you're you're busy and everything.",
    "But thank you for the nice comments.",
    "I really appreciate that.",
    "Thank you for supporting my art.",
    "All right, so we've got a couple of ways.",
    "Thank you Michael.",
    "Have a good day.",
    "Take care.",
    "Thanks for the company.",
    "Less than one was using the heck out of my customizable buttons.",
    "We put customizable buttons.",
    "That sounds good.",
    "Is that like a shortcut?",
    "Alright, we should probably look in a black and white at the painting and see how we're doing.",
    "Actually not too bad, but as usual, I need to be more intense.",
    "Usually when I as I work on the painting, it gets to be higher contrast as we go.",
    "If you look at my values here, I need to go brighter where the light is hitting on the top clouds Anna little bit darker on the shadows in the bottom cloud so.",
    "Seems normal for my workflow so I can run the right track.",
    "We gotta keep going.",
    "We can add some little.",
    "Bright lights up here.",
    "Little clouds popping out a little further into the light.",
    "Alright, let's try some a little bit of color Dodge.",
    "I don't want to go too much because I really just want to pop this in a couple of places.",
    "I'm going to uncheck the transparency shapes layer and have color Dodge mode selected and then really I just want to do this kind of little pop of highlight.",
    "I know it's kind of over exposing a little bit, but that's sort of what it looks like in the reference to an.",
    "I think if we just do a little bit then it can make the lighting feel stronger.",
    "It already feels like it.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Need to screw, hopefully my first and last visit to dentist.",
    "Oh, definitely.",
    "Fingers crossed.",
    "I hope all goes Super Smooth.",
    "Foster an that you feel good and no pain.",
    "No thank you.",
    "Thank you for the nice comments.",
    "Take care will see you soon.",
    "Alright, will do the reverse of what I just did, so new layer on multiply instead of color Dodge and let's do a little bit of shadows down here so go a little bit more.",
    "Darker colors and just paying attention to where the shadows are.",
    "In the reference, maybe go a little bit more towards blue appear.",
    "OK, so if we do it before and after.",
    "Before, after, well, that definitely, I think.",
    "Let's let's undo we doing too.",
    "I'm going to tone down the color Dodge layer a little bit, 'cause that was intense.",
    "Alright, let's try again.",
    "The before and after.",
    "I think it's a little bit better.",
    "We filled out paint on top of here and like, really.",
    "Merge in or paint in.",
    "Once you do a bunch of layer blending modes, it can sometimes look a little bit.",
    "I don't know.",
    "I don't explain that effects can look a little bit.",
    "Digital yeah, I mean the color Dodge can have really digital kind of look even though I love it.",
    "So it's nice to paint on top of it and then you kind of paint away some of that effect and make it look more handgun.",
    "So you can color pick from whatever the color Dodge did.",
    "You can color pic right from that and kind of work that color into the rest of your painting.",
    "Hidden type this here's what I ended up going with its in Cape Town.",
    "According to math grunge.",
    "Alright, let's see.",
    "Oh nice.",
    "Yeah, this is a good.",
    "This is a good kind of scene to start within their hidden tides.",
    "I learned that by some of the early ones I tried to do with like cities, and way too much stuff in the scene.",
    "And then I got distracted by that and I wasn't able to focus on.",
    "The values in the lighting and so I think it's really good to start with these types of scenes.",
    "This reminds me a little bit of the overcast one that we painted here today.",
    "It's got like kind of Moody Sky.",
    "Yeah, nice job.",
    "Here, do you use your own brushes?",
    "Let me see.",
    "Yes, and Ari is loading for me now.",
    "Oh yeah, yeah, I do use those brushes.",
    "I'm not using them right now in these paintings because it's not really the right like subject matter for that, but I recently did the windmill painting, which I think I posted here on the hands.",
    "2 but basically, anytime that I paint environments with that I want to have in that kind of style.",
    "I use that brush pack.",
    "I have it actually open right now on my way to my brush back, but I have it.",
    "I have it right now.",
    "Yeah, I do use that one.",
    "It just depends.",
    "I'm not always going for that type of style, but I made the brushes to help me be able to paint in that style more easily.",
    "So.",
    "Ha ha Oh yeah, it's where do I do paint in traditional?",
    "Let me give you the link to my.",
    "Account where I post traditional work if you are curious to see.",
    "Uhm, I post on Instagram.",
    "OK, I hope I caught all the.",
    "Um, questions in the chat.",
    "I was scrolling a little bit fast for a moment there, so if I missed any important, if I missed any questions feel free to mention them again to me.",
    "So I'm going to give a little bit of affective dissolving away from this larger cloud groups.",
    "And like there's a little little tiny.",
    "Must be clouds.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Thank you, thanks in ties.",
    "Yeah, so you guys can see.",
    "Some of my gouache paintings and I've been doing some watercolor lately too, but I haven't uploaded anything yet of the watercolor adventures, but I will.",
    "I will I have to photograph some things and.",
    "I will show.",
    "So there does seem to be a little bit of a core shadow on these clouds, like there's an area that has the darkest points, the Darkest Shadow, and then there's.",
    "Lighter, like whether it's a bounce light from the Sky on one side and light from this.",
    "Sun on another side.",
    "Let me show you guys on the reference.",
    "what I mean is that there's kind of this area here that is like the darkest part, and that's not on the edge of the cloud.",
    "You know, there's lighter blue and then later warm color down here.",
    "So I'm trying to pay attention to that and not get a multi color there and still have a little bit of something darker.",
    "Yeah, this soft.",
    "With be brush is really nice for painting clouds.",
    "It just has the.",
    "Nice texture for this.",
    "This type of cloud.",
    "If so many types of clouds.",
    "All thank you.",
    "Thank you for the next common sequence.",
    "Appreciated.",
    "This one is so tough.",
    "I feel like this is the hardest one.",
    "I don't know why.",
    "I don't know why is getting we're getting there, but oh, it's just.",
    "Tough, I'm the colors get so quickly.",
    "They get muddy so quickly.",
    "So I really love this blue color on the side.",
    "I wonder if I can how I can add more of that, if there's a way with the layer blending mode or if I should just kind of.",
    "Just take the time through hand painted in.",
    "I think I'm going to stay zoomed out for a little bit, maybe that'll help with seeing the big picture, but I'm starting to see shapes in the clouds.",
    "It's funny.",
    "Are your brains of that?",
    "Even painted clouds, we get the same kind of effect that looks like this.",
    "It looks like that.",
    "You know kinds of things.",
    "And flip the canvas.",
    "And.",
    "Hum.",
    "Yeah, I think it's better if we light and this is helping.",
    "You guys are welcome to ask me if you have any questions and I'm getting it a little bit in the zone here.",
    "'cause I'm trying to figure this out.",
    "This wasn't quite puzzled.",
    "The favor do anything and you're wondering what I'm doing.",
    "If I go through something really quick, you're welcome to ask and I'm happy to explain it.",
    "I'm going to come up here and.",
    "Get a little bit of these squirrels.",
    "Hi Pablo, thanks for hanging out with this.",
    "In keeping with us.",
    "Have a good rest of your day and good luck with your animation.",
    "I'm going to try using selective color and going to the Reds, so I feel like that's the issue that's the part of painting that I'm not happy with.",
    "So maybe I can.",
    "Do something here.",
    "Let's try that again.",
    "Or maybe a little bit more cyan, but we can make that.",
    "We can either make the Reds brighter.",
    "Jamming out my neighborhood.",
    "Let's go a little bit later, a little bit more saturated that hasn't more cheerful look.",
    "I feel like the darker Reds were getting muddy somehow.",
    "This is a intense color, but it's a happy color, so maybe that helps.",
    "So thank you, selected color.",
    "Going to try it out.",
    "Yeah, it's working better.",
    "See I really love using the selective color and layer blending modes to help fix things.",
    "Sometimes when it's not flowing, it can really make such a big difference.",
    "Suddenly get back in a groove again.",
    "I'm also going to choose make a new layer and choose a harder edged brush.",
    "To put in some last little details, like for example down here, I don't know if that's the right brush, though we try a different one, but I do want.",
    "I want more details, little things.",
    "Yeah, let's try textured one that small.",
    "So my point is, on the edge of these clouds, there's little wispy things that come off and have smaller little details and right now.",
    "Haven't quite gotten that, so we're missing out on some.",
    "Of the design.",
    "So it's nice to have different.",
    "Levels of.",
    "Of detail like you want to have bigger shapes, medium shapes and smaller shapes make things interesting.",
    "So we definitely need a little bit more of these smaller shapes.",
    "Do you got a separate layer?",
    "In case we don't like how it looks?",
    "Also, I could lower the opacity.",
    "Is there too intense?",
    "But we do like the shapes.",
    "That's possible too.",
    "Yes, I'm going to add a little bit more.",
    "Be surrounded little little puffs.",
    "Same over here and we can kind of do the opposite for the shadows.",
    "That gives it all.",
    "Rounded shape slices.",
    "It is giving more detail.",
    "Now that I like all of it.",
    "But we're just going to keep going.",
    "We're going to keep going.",
    "We're almost there, I think.",
    "At least for this study.",
    "I think the most important thing for me is making sure that the values are right and the colours but.",
    "The thing that I'm not quite getting is to me, even though even though we have the values and colors right, and that's generally my, that's generally my most important thing when I'm painting.",
    "But I do feel like texture in this topic is a really, really big.",
    "So if you don't get the texture right, then it just kind of looks like play dough or something.",
    "It doesn't quite look like clouds, and I do feel like I'm fighting that bit right now.",
    "But I'm just going to take it as far as I can in the next few minutes until we're out of time and if I have to, after a little bit of a break, I'll come back and see if maybe something will.",
    "Start flowing a little bit more about it.",
    "I don't know if you guys have had that with your clouds in the past, but sometimes they can look a little bit too.",
    "Little bit to play DoH.",
    "I want to keep them feeling with Bionaire E.",
    "It's a tough thing sometimes.",
    "But that is what we're trying to work on in these studies is just figuring out how to paint this particular topic and sort of troubleshooting it.",
    "Actually, because every time you try one of these paintings are going to try a little different approach and see what works the best.",
    "So.",
    "I think one thing that I've found to work well for that area feeling is this type of texture, so having little streaks and things sort of cutting into the shape and making it, you know, giving a little bit.",
    "It's not so solid just so I guess it makes sense if you're going for an area book that you have something like that little bit of a dissolving effect to the clouds.",
    "So maybe I'll try to do more of that.",
    "Ah.",
    "Yeah scenario, you're really sweet.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Thank you for the kind words.",
    "I'm very thankful you guys are.",
    "Going to come hang out and spend your day making art with me.",
    "Very nice, very appreciated and I'm happy if I can help teach anything that I have learned along the way.",
    "Though as you can see I'm still also learning.",
    "So kind of sharing the process and the journey.",
    "Yeah, this is better.",
    "This is better you guys.",
    "I think we have a discovery.",
    "So whether it's a streaky brush or maybe just the noisy brush with little texture, if you want an area look.",
    "Don't paint with just a solid hard brush, apparently.",
    "Or maybe it would have worked out eventually without ton of rendering, but speed paint wise.",
    "From texture brushes like this seems to be really helpful.",
    "Maybe they make it a little more interesting to look at 'cause you kind of get these little brush strokes.",
    "That was like a real paint stroke kind of thing.",
    "Yeah I want a couple that are a little bit more.",
    "Well, more splash of way up here.",
    "Here.",
    "Trying to figure out how we can be.",
    "What is a good balance?",
    "I'm going to switch to another brush real quick 'cause I need to paint.",
    "A little bit more thick detail I want to bring in.",
    "Another like sort of crack in the clouds over here.",
    "Maybe that's another thing that I was missing.",
    "2 might so many of my little openings in the clouds got filled in, so it's like a big blob.",
    "We don't want that.",
    "No block cloud please.",
    "I hope you guys are doing good.",
    "If you are working on this study or any other things, I hope it's going well.",
    "So they went really fast.",
    "It was kind of crazy.",
    "Yes, we've got that little silver lining kind of glow on the outside of these.",
    "These little areas.",
    "No sections of cloud.",
    "So there's a OK.",
    "So if you look at the reference.",
    "Feel like my like openings in the cloud.",
    "They're coming very much to appoint an.",
    "It's a bit distracting.",
    "In mind.",
    "So let's uhm break it up a little bit.",
    "We don't have to have it all coming to the point.",
    "We can move things around.",
    "I know it's like similar to the reference, but I gotta work around that.",
    "Maybe we'll just take this away, let it be like little crack in the clouds, but it won't go all the way.",
    "To the other and end up making a point there, we could go this way.",
    "Something like that that may be better.",
    "It can be trailing off.",
    "But yeah, that looked a little weird to me.",
    "Compositional issues in cloud printing.",
    "And we'll go back with that other brush that was working out.",
    "Now that we've got the.",
    "Cracks moved around.",
    "It did not really fast.",
    "Are you crazy?",
    "I'm happy that I ended up getting the clouds looking a little bit more abstract.",
    "I kind of bothers me a little bit when they start looking kind of like something else, but not fully like I kind of want to embrace it.",
    "Almost like put a an animal in the Sky like I seen paintings that are like a whale and this guy or like a Wolf or something, but I find it a little distracting if if one of the shapes kind of looks like something, but like just barely.",
    "It's like I don't know that I would kind of want to push it further in that direction or just have it be a little bit more abstract.",
    "To where you're not trying like?",
    "Figure it out.",
    "Oh, by projects.",
    "Thank you for hanging out.",
    "Enjoy the rest of your day.",
    "Wow, thank you, tell a I'm really happy you think so.",
    "And looking at your work, they've been brilliant.",
    "His bonus.",
    "Same thing is very interesting dynamics.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Thank you clever.",
    "Appreciate you hanging out.",
    "Yeah, this one really, really mystified me.",
    "I'm I'm a lot happier than now.",
    "But I do still feel like.",
    "Maybe there's something I missed with the lighting coming from below.",
    "Maybe I could still get that a little bit better, but uhm.",
    "I'm starting to get happy with it.",
    "Sometimes it takes awhile little while.",
    "Working through.",
    "What you feel like is ugly phase.",
    "And finally, see the light.",
    "There's a cloud that looks like a face.",
    "Can you see it?",
    "Which one this one started to look like?",
    "It was like a profile of something looking to the side.",
    "But I'm not I don't know if I've seen the one you're talking about, but this one looks like it could be like a beak like.",
    "Like a beak of a bird or something like once you start looking has a pointy hat.",
    "Only and are not seen it the pointy hat.",
    "Although who knows I might be painting over it right now in like ruining it, but.",
    "You might have to do a paint over.",
    "Um?",
    "Ah, thank you.",
    "Yes and Ari.",
    "I preferred to paint in Photoshop.",
    "That's like my favorite place to paint.",
    "I have also tried procreate and it is really cool.",
    "I have.",
    "I got an iPad for Christmas which was amazing surprise and I do love it.",
    "And The thing is though I was kind of thinking that iPad would be used more for for like travel and painting out and about kind of things for doing like Plein air or something because I'm really.",
    "Comfortable at home, like working in Photoshop and working on my sense because it feels like a very solid like my my set up.",
    "My tablet is very have a tablet arm that hasn't attached so when I say solid I mean it's like with the iPod.",
    "I'm kind of just holding it.",
    "I don't have a I don't have a stand for it or anything.",
    "So anyway, it feels a lot less.",
    "It's a lot harder for me to do polished work on there.",
    "Plus yet then you don't get the full photo shop and everything, so I definitely prefer working on PC.",
    "But I think maybe eventually when it's more possible to travel and stuff like that again, maybe I'll be able to take my iPad on adventures and then I'll really enjoy that.",
    "Below the one you showed the first time.",
    "Oh is it this one?",
    "You See and and.",
    "Yeah, now I'm kind of feeling like it would be fun to do a painting of some kind of.",
    "The magical Sky creature.",
    "Certain things work really well for that, like like I could see a dragon.",
    "Or a big bird or something like that.",
    "Just want to add that last little bit of dimension to some of these clouds in the center.",
    "Think of it poof, ear.",
    "And I think we're about there.",
    "There is a moon in the reference picture.",
    "In the reference picture there is a moon, so maybe it would be cool to add that I'm going to do it next separate layer because it maybe we can have the Moon a little bit more.",
    "Little bit bigger, but I want to just test it out first.",
    "So something like that.",
    "That's cool, the brush texture kind of started to look like little craters or something.",
    "I do think it kind of belongs there, although we need to put the moon behind the clouds.",
    "'cause Yeah, the moon wouldn't be in front of the clouds.",
    "That doesn't make sense.",
    "Unless we put it up here then we can do however bright we want.",
    "Yeah, I kind of like that and then let's do a new layer and put little pad.",
    "Thank you Sophie.",
    "Little tiny bit of wisp in front.",
    "Of the moon.",
    "I figure out what's the right amount of wisp.",
    "This is the kind of thing that I could spend a long time on you guys.",
    "This one little insignificant.",
    "I mean if you say insignificant, but it's like I mean something that you're I will be attracted to very much in the painting, but it can sometimes take a long time to decide on those types of things.",
    "Like just how much to cover up the moon.",
    "You know?",
    "Company.",
    "Right, we're definitely getting rid of Sailor Moon bags now.",
    "Yeah, it depending on the person the moon might be.",
    "You know you might prefer it without.",
    "Yeah, I kinda like it up.",
    "There is a little bit better.",
    "And if we're going to have the moon.",
    "We could pop in a couple little dots.",
    "I have not tried it.",
    "I have not tried photo shop on the on the iPad.",
    "Of course we could have like a little shooting star or something like that.",
    "It just seems like that kind of scene, doesn't it?",
    "Another wouldn't be really too many stars below where starts to get light.",
    "Alright you guys.",
    "Well, I feel like we're at the end here for now.",
    "Maybe I'll come back to this and do a little bit more work on the bottom 'cause this is still the part that I feel like could use some improvement, but we're out of time for today and I'm happy enough with it to end here.",
    "But if anybody was painting along with this one and you want to share your welcome to post in the chat, you can.",
    "You can let me know if you are, you know, uploading your RN.",
    "You want me to wait for you, 'cause I'll make sure not to end stream too soon, but I don't remember if anybody said they were working on this one so you guys can let me know, but you're always welcome to share with me even post stream if you want to share your work in my discord server, there's a link to that below the below the stream in the description.",
    "And also you can find my Twitter and Instagram down there.",
    "If you want, but these studies are part of A.",
    "Group study session that we're doing in my discord called the art club.",
    "In every two weeks there's a new topic, so we're doing clouds this time around.",
    "Can you tell us before I forget?",
    "Here's the finished version of Sailor Moon, let's see.",
    "Yeah, I'm a teller.",
    "That's awesome.",
    "Guys check this out.",
    "This is traditional by the way.",
