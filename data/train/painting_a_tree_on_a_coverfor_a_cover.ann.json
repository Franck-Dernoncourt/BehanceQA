    "Hard to really say what's happy written by.",
    "Yeah, so we're going to.",
    "We're going to do that.",
    "Sounds like fun.",
    "I think it sounds like fun.",
    "Let's go ahead and get to it.",
    "Here we go.",
    "We log off Instagram said were not interrupted so much, you know?",
    "Set my timer and we're going to begin.",
    "I think the first thing we're going to do.",
    "The check this out for a little.",
    "Little lesson in.",
    "How to clean up some of this?",
    "I'm going to do.",
    "This guide these guys.",
    "So that I'm aware of what my live area is.",
    "This is honestly a bit of a strange.",
    "Size for a book.",
    "I don't know how they're using it, but is what they gave me.",
    "So I will be aware whenever you're hiring somebody wanted to make sure that you're given the right.",
    "Sizes and all that.",
    "OK, So what we're going to do?",
    "We're going to get rid of the blue lines we have our guides.",
    "I'm going to hide him by hitting command; Or control.",
    "If you're on a PC.",
    "Hit command you.",
    "We're going to go to our master here and Drop it down to saillans me.",
    "Personally, I liked it up the saturation.",
    "Go to Blues up the saturation and hit OK.",
    "I swear it acts differently than if you just go back and do this next step, which is what we're about to do.",
    "We're going to command you again.",
    "Cyan's gonna drop the saturation.",
    "And then up the lightness.",
    "Same thing with Blues drop, saturation up the lightness.",
    "Being all the way to white, if you want to.",
    "I don't like to go to white cause a lot of times it leaves holes, but since in this case is not interacting with the line art, it's actually pretty clear.",
    "That's the first step.",
    "The second step is.",
    "For the sake of cleaning it up, I'm gonna turn on my guides.",
    "Hit M for marquee.",
    "Oh, you know what I turn off my snapping up?",
    "Snap to guides.",
    "So now I'm right where I wanted to be.",
    "Select the inverse command shift I.",
    "It D for black-and-white hit command delete to fill with background color, not foreground color.",
    "And finally.",
    "Man shift you to desaturate, so now this is in black and white.",
    "There's not a lot of difference, but there's little difference there, and the reason we're going to do that is because now we're going to use our levels to turn turn these lights lines from Grey's to Blacks, so command L for levels.",
    "Left slider makes things darker.",
    "Right slider makes the white whiter.",
    "Let's see.",
    "You gotta be careful 'cause it'll.",
    "Her away.",
    "At the lines, if you go too much.",
    "So when you have something like this, this scan right here is not a very clean scan.",
    "It's a little choppy.",
    "Maybe the resolution was a little bad.",
    "We're going to go a little bit on the left slider.",
    "And instead we're going to darken the Greys.",
    "Using the Gray instead of black and now he can kind of.",
    "Come back to slightly.",
    "It's hardly anything I think I even went back.",
    "He bring in some of that Gray so we stop losing.",
    "Most of the stuff in the background.",
    "See right here, these right here.",
    "Those lines were part of the cyan, you know.",
    "And sometimes you gotta go back in there and paint those out.",
    "Since I'm going to be painting over a lot of this, I'm not too worried about it, but I am going to come in and do a really quick Patch job.",
    "In fact, you can use.",
    "The spot healing brush.",
    "Think that's done.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Spot healing brush is pretty cool 'cause he just.",
    "What it does is it takes.",
    "Everything around it.",
    "Like It takes samples from here and then samples from here and then.",
    "It just turns it into whatever your brushes.",
    "Like it blends him pulling those two edges together so it's kind of cool.",
    "Makes it very quick.",
    "Patch job.",
    "You don't have to worry too much about anything.",
    "It's a lot like the content aware.",
    "Bill.",
    "The photo shop has which is magic.",
    "I go see.",
    "Like even right here.",
    "See how it blends that this edge with that edge?",
    "You hardly see any difference.",
    "It's really cool.",
    "And then.",
    "But if you go sample did not work.",
    "Did you go really large like that, isn't it?",
    "Yeah, it takes a little a little longer to process it, but it still does and that's pretty neat, right?",
    "So like really, I could go right here and do that.",
    "And if there's a little too much.",
    "So I'm just going to do that instead.",
    "Nice right?",
    "Spot healing brush.",
    "That's what we're looking at right now.",
    "Perdon eat I know.",
    "He is that same technique to get rid of that X.",
    "And that X.",
    "Not crazy like magic.",
    "Have any?",
    "Let's see now.",
    "I think that was about it.",
    "And then there was the quickest.",
    "Is the quickest cleanup.",
    "There was like not even 10 minutes.",
    "Good job, good job guys.",
    "All right, now we want to save these lines.",
    "I like to go to channels down here in the bottom of this dot it again, watch my cursor down here on the bottom where we have this dotted circle.",
    "If you hover over that, it says load channel's selection.",
    "And I have a selection.",
    "It's actually selecting all the white on the image and not selecting the black.",
    "Create a new channel.",
    "There's two ways to do this.",
    "I like to invert my selection, command, shift I.",
    "So now I'm selecting all the lines.",
    "And then I hit command delete.",
    "I'm sorry option delete to fill with white 'cause I have my foreground and background color right here on the right side is Maine.",
    "But now this is actually just a snapshot of our lines that we can refer back to if we need to go back and save them, but we're going to paint over a lot of this, specially in the middle ground in background.",
    "The foreground is the important part here.",
    "Or not too worried about anything in the background, but we're going to start here in a sack.",
    "I like to duplicate my layers because I like to use multiply.",
    "And I fill.",
    "Oh And I filled with.",
    "50% Gray I always colorize my lines.",
    "Set it to color.",
    "So this is going to have a lot of like earthy Browns and greens.",
    "I think.",
    "I think the red will look nice.",
    "We're going to go ahead and lock that.",
    "What else do we need to do?",
    "Let's see, um.",
    "Should we make flats for this?",
    "No.",
    "We probably should, right?",
    "OK, let's make flats.",
    "Let's make some flats.",
    "Now we're making flats person.",
    "I like to work off of.",
    "Who's gonna channels load that collection?",
    "And then we're going to go ahead and fill it with black.",
    "Also going to duplicate this and fill it in white.",
    "We're going to create the line art again.",
    "Whenever I'm selecting for flats, I like to use the black and white line art over.",
    "Um, the colored one.",
    "It might be in my head.",
    "Sometimes it seems like it's a little better.",
    "Also, wow, this is really tiny.",
    "All right, we're going to go to preserve details 2.0 that's my favorite for.",
    "Raising And make this 6000.",
    "In OK.",
    "Defline What is up?",
    "How are you?",
    "How are you doing today?",
    "He said yes, but yes to what I don't know what you say.",
    "Boys have been attention to what I said when you responded, sorry.",
    "But yeah, it might be in my head.",
    "I think.",
    "I think whenever I select make selections.",
    "On like the color eyes line art, which is the red one.",
    "Which I will show once my photo shop unfreezes.",
    "Oh It seems like the selections are a little fuzzier than if I use the black and White, which makes sense because.",
    "Selections in Photoshop works off of value, so you want to make sure that.",
    "If you give the better contrast of black with the white, I think it just grabs.",
    "Grab the value difference a little better.",
    "Doing good things, how is you?",
    "I am good.",
    "I am full.",
    "I just came back from eating.",
    "Had a very healthy meal.",
    "The double cheeseburger and a milkshake.",
    "And fries and now have palpitations.",
    "I'm doing good, though I'm exaggerating.",
    "I'm doing good though.",
    "Yes to the flats.",
    "Got it OK?",
    "Well then let's do some flats because D is asking for it.",
    "So if he wants it.",
    "Degats flats that simple.",
    "I think what I want to do.",
    "Is select.",
    "The main tree trunk.",
    "And then this Hill, right here.",
    "I'm not going to select the wheat here because I'm I might create a.",
    "Brush from this.",
    "'cause it's random enough to actually create a really cool brush to add a week here in the front.",
    "Or not, we but just like fuzzy grass, but OK, so we're going to go right here.",
    "Yep, there we go nice.",
    "Make sure where.",
    "Not anti alias.",
    "We want to be anti anti alias.",
    "And fill their.",
    "From means you went somewhere.",
    "Whatever, yes, I did have water burger.",
    "Absolutely, and it was amazing.",
    "You know they have and you.",
    "Pico de Gaio Burger Bro, let me tell you right now.",
    "I want you to stop what you're doing.",
    "And make yourself a Pico de gaio burger.",
    "That was Pepper Jack cheese.",
    "Amazing.",
    "It was so good.",
    "You know me too well.",
    "Let me guess the water burger.",
    "Then I showed that tick tock of A.",
    "The Texan at how in and out.",
    "For the first time.",
    "Uh, the burger wars.",
    "So funny.",
    "I know you're nowhere near one.",
    "That's one thing you gotta make yourself one, then there's.",
    "Sorry, there's no way around it, pal.",
    "You're just going to have to make one for yourself.",
    "I could buy one.",
    "Flash freeze it and send it your way if you want.",
    "Well, saying this, this one right here for this.",
    "Um?",
    "Cover I don't have a lot of direction, they just wanted like a slightly decaying tree.",
    "And, uh.",
    "It's supposed to have like some kind of magic property the tree.",
    "Where?",
    "It's a portal if I remember correctly.",
    "You know now that I think about it, I don't know if I have permission to stream this.",
    "So I'm not going to talk about what I do know about the project, which for the record is not a lot.",
    "I just know that it's for a book.",
    "And I'll stop talking about that now.",
    "Maybe halfway drive fast.",
    "Also tipping yaki in Hawaiian and Bahama but Bahama Bucks Real Alright.",
    "But yeah, So what was I was talking about this particular project not allowed direction.",
    "Which makes me nervous.",
    "I always get nervous when, uh.",
    "Clients don't give me a lot of direction because then that.",
    "That typically means that they don't.",
    "It's one of two things.",
    "They don't know what they want.",
    "Or they're just super chill and they're like whatever it's fine as long as it looks good.",
    "Most of the time, it's definitely the former.",
    "And so that's why I get a little nervous, especially when.",
    "When it's a new client, we've never worked together before.",
    "But Hopefully if we make it look stellar.",
    "It won't matter too much.",
    "And what I'm doing right now for you guys just joining.",
    "And we haven't seen my stream before.",
    "I like to paint.",
    "And put the loan and prepare painting.",
    "With a process called Flatting.",
    "It is incredibly mundane.",
    "In uh is boring.",
    "It'll make you go a little crazy, but.",
    "At the end of the day, it will actually help you.",
    "Save a little bit of time.",
    "And some of your pieces.",
    "Now let's go ahead and fill all of this.",
    "Is it going to Maine?",
    "Trying to save the tree.",
    "Then I'm going to go back and make a second selection for this Hill right here.",
    "Only really trying to save this tree right here.",
    "You know, I thought the same thing when I saw it.",
    "You Mace.",
    "Oops.",
    "Right now what we're working on is, uh.",
    "We're using quick masks, which if you hit Qi think its default set on by default to queue.",
    "On your keyboard it'll take you 2 quick mask the and or the interface.",
    "It's right here on this.",
    "This button right here if you ever click on it.",
    "Normally it's backwards though right now, but I'm selecting is green whereas the default is what I'm not selecting is green.",
    "Because I tell him, ask actually works like right now.",
    "I'm selecting everything around the tree, but I'm asking real life.",
    "Have I had a green piece of paper to make a mask?",
    "This is exactly how it would make the mask.",
    "In real life, for it to work, but digitally my for some reason my hedges sees it backwards like I want to see.",
    "What I'm not selecting or what I don't want to select so that I can make sure that my selection is as clean as possible, so that's why I like to go in and do it backwards on this.",
    "So we see right here that would select it is all the outside and that's OK.",
    "We're going to hit select dropdown to modify.",
    "I think my images a blocking it, but select modify expand.",
    "We're at 400 pixels, so two pixels should be OK.",
    "Maybe 1 I'm going to hit 2.",
    "That might not have been enough, So what we're going to do is we're going to go back.",
    "Select, modify, expand Ringo with three.",
    "OK, that's a lot nicer.",
    "And now here comes the clean up process is going to take you again, but now most of this stuff is filled in.",
    "But I want to fill in.",
    "Oh, like this little gap does rock right here.",
    "See this.",
    "Bill that.",
    "Will it in black?",
    "Black is selected.",
    "White is deselected.",
    "There in this one I'm just going to go.",
    "Hand.",
    "When you're selecting things with the wand and all that, that's just to help you.",
    "Get a Head Start.",
    "Ultimately, you're still gonna have to go in manually.",
    "Clean up what you really need to clean up.",
    "But if you do a little by little.",
    "It won't be that painful.",
    "The with black perfect.",
    "Mr.",
    "Little spot right there.",
    "Oh that was black.",
    "Usually flatting will take anywhere from 40 minutes to an hour and a half.",
    "Right now we're looking at maybe when is it like 1015 minutes so far and we're almost done.",
    "I was going to be a quick one.",
    "Get back in here.",
    "Cut out where I expand it too much.",
    "But with white.",
    "Fill this with black.",
    "Here.",
    "Oh yeah.",
    "That's The One I was looking for.",
    "Here we go.",
    "Next Gotta Love Flatting, isn't it?",
    "Eventful, isn't it fun?",
    "Just like the coolest thing you've ever seen.",
    "I know it is you don't have to lie.",
    "This is the actual line we're going to plug that.",
    "Perfect.",
    "And I think what I'm actually going to do for the leaves I'm gonna.",
    "More than likely.",
    "Well, I'm going to be using a.",
    "Custom brush Maybe a mixer brush like I might paint a couple of these.",
    "Selected with the mixer brush and then use that to fill in the rest.",
    "So I'm just selecting that as a whole.",
    "I'm not even worried about it.",
    "Anything else but.",
    "I think this is the last bit.",
    "There.",
    "Oh, there's a cast shadow.",
    "Next Perfect we did it guys and we did it in record time.",
    "Wasn't even 20 minutes.",
    "Alright, Little Hill.",
    "We got there and select the inverse.",
    "We're going to duplicate, right?",
    "There were just going to fill it with a crazy red for no reason.",
    "Because we're not going to look at, this is going to be covered.",
    "They're gonna go back here.",
    "And since this is our broken up, I think it just might be easier to trace it by hand.",
    "Nobody wants to do things by hand anymore, but he wants it automated.",
    "Including me.",
    "Sometimes you just get a little tired here.",
    "Alright, Here we go.",
    "I think what I'm going to do here is I'm just going to select it straight.",
    "I'll explain why when I use.",
    "My grass brush.",
    "Sorry, that made all busy means my grass brush to create that edge.",
    "No, that's the same Hill I'm going to say that it isn't, so I'm going to go right there.",
    "And get a crazy blue and bam book.",
    "Noble and bam, Mario.",
    "Next Let's see.",
    "Then And go back in real quick and select.",
    "All these leaves at didn't.",
    "Phil.",
    "Then Just for the sake of making it a little clean.",
    "Gonna go in.",
    "Evil little bleed area.",
    "Here, here.",
    "There was bugging me that he was so so wild and out of place.",
    "OK.",
    "We're going to hit save.",
    "I don't even think I have.",
    "Haven't even save this file yet.",
    "'cause I'm never do.",
    "Went to the recent commissions folder, create a new one.",
    "I.",
    "I think it's called the doorway.",
    "We're going to call it the doorway P1 perfect alright?",
    "Suchat are stylus for a stroke mid with the Little Spring in it.",
    "Let's get to doing some black and white painting for now.",
    "Couple of things we're going to keep in mind will be touching on it.",
    "Well, it happens I guess.",
    "Is that this is for print, so it means that.",
    "I have to be careful and make sure that I don't go out of the print gamut.",
    "Call that F and we're going to turn it off because we can still select on our layers.",
    "If it's off, we can still select it, see.",
    "So.",
    "We're going to go and use.",
    "Black and white.",
    "May like to always start with a reverse gradient.",
    "Mr create focal point.",
    "Make sure that everything around it is darker.",
    "So that we're focused right here.",
    "The Hill.",
    "Yes, I can really dark and.",
    "The edge of this tree.",
    "He had just bought Dark Valley work, made a gloomy Yep.",
    "But it's going to be a little.",
    "Nicer I think when I'm done with it, hopefully.",
    "How is the goal anyway?",
    "So what we're going to do is like they were going to use A.",
    "Gradient map to paint it to pay most of it.",
    "Who?",
    "Then You like that with Sky could stand to be a little brighter.",
    "It brings in some of the.",
    "Oh, why do we use of gradient but a linear gradient?",
    "Said to about 30%.",
    "OK, I like that.",
    "Men.",
    "Check this out.",
    "We're going to go into adjustments.",
    "Create a gradient map or all of it.",
    "A greater map is actually trying to make a gradient out of black and white, or I should say White and black so all the Dark is now white.",
    "And all the light is now black, so that's kind of funny, but.",
    "You can do the reverse and it does exactly what we already have, red and green.",
    "Orange and purple.",
    "All these colors that you got, so I think.",
    "You might actually have to create one 'cause I don't have anything that's very earthy.",
    "Anything that's.",
    "Super earthy.",
    "Hum.",
    "Now we're gonna have to make 1.",
    "It looks nice down, looks nice.",
    "OK, So what we're going to do?",
    "Is we are now going to?",
    "Modify this so now again this is black and this is white.",
    "So everything that is white.",
    "Is going to be assigned the colour that's here and every value in between those two is going to go according to that.",
    "We have this color right here.",
    "We're going to change it back, apparently.",
    "We changed his colored to a green.",
    "Fun Orange Green.",
    "Orange green, yellow, green.",
    "Come up, as in you're better than that.",
    "And this one right here.",
    "All of them were just dropping him down to the green yellow grains.",
    "As it gets warmer, I'm going to push.",
    "In a little bit more to the yellow.",
    "Could even use this one's.",
    "Sky color, if we really wanted to, we could.",
    "My Sky is dark, so I could actually make it dark.",
    "But we're not going to.",
    "Do that.",
    "We're going to go under the assumption that they wanted a bright Sky, like a full day.",
    "I hope that's what they want.",
    "And then this white right here.",
    "This way.",
    "And it turn it into like this.",
    "Yellow bright yellow.",
    "Weight room and add this one.",
    "Boom Low earthy how I could?",
    "Then we could even play a little bit more with.",
    "But it covers, you know.",
    "And it will be a little more green in there.",
    "But I like how dramatic that is.",
    "Nice.",
    "So that's one of the cool things about gradient Maps is that you can take them and they will do a lot of heavy lifting for you is all we did was we have our peace, the added value.",
    "And then we threw in the gradient map in the gradient map again using the values that you've created will go ahead and.",
    "Paint for you mad cool.",
    "My name is pretty cool.",
    "Correct and Stand Up and stretch.",
    "If you guys are drawing with me, stand up and stretch maybe.",
    "Normally people are going to tell you to save at this time, not me, because I maintain that savings for cowards.",
    "But seriously, Dave.",
    "To hit the old save button right there.",
    "By the way, that you guys can hear me.",
    "OK, I hope it's not buffering or anything.",
    "Do let me know if that's happening.",
    "Let me know if it's too quiet.",
    "The only problem I think.",
    "I might have is that?",
    "Sometimes I drop frames.",
    "I know that because.",
    "My own.",
    "My screen won't show up on my stream.",
    "It tends to be on my end.",
    "Alright, let's look for little bit of reference of like a rolling Hills type thing.",
    "This is what we should be inspired.",
    "Sponsor.",
    "You have these health formations right here.",
    "Not crazy, he was.",
    "I mean that's a painting, but that's really cool.",
    "Unlike other forming it like that.",
    "Telling me I was like, well, those heels are crazy 'cause it's all that and then I saw that and I was like dope but I think that's a painting.",
    "We want to get something.",
    "Thinking something like this or maybe even like this.",
    "Or it?",
    "It's my Golden color in the Sky, I think.",
    "OK, so now we're just going to paint in some of the Sky.",
    "We're going to come back and.",
    "To paint back.",
    "These are getting blurred out.",
    "We're going to paint them back in.",
    "The reason I do want this guy to be a little brighter is because it will make sure that it calls attention to our.",
    "Our tree here.",
    "Is obviously one.",
    "Dark around that.",
    "I'm going to know lyrics.",
    "I'm not too sure about it so.",
    "I don't like it.",
    "Bringing his light blue again here.",
    "By pure coincidence it goes right where we want it.",
    "This area.",
    "We're just gonna.",
    "9.",
    "Want to bring a little bit of that blue 'cause that's going to create?",
