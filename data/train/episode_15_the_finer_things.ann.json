    "Um, it's kinda cool.",
    "It's about Trump.",
    "I haven't really done like a Donald Trump piece before or anything to do with politics really.",
    "I try and avoid it as much as possible really, but In this sense I don't really mind because there's a lot of things going on in the world right now and I think that my imagery can make a difference.",
    "So.",
    "I'm going to attempt to make that difference with these images, but.",
    "But yeah.",
    "So we're not going to worry about that one right now.",

    "Get rid of lower OK, uhm, lower and upper perfect.",
    "So I just want this.",
    "And let's see if there's any like cool pixel squid elements that we can bring in here, so pixel squid.",
    "I just want to get a desk or something, but like a cooler desk.",
    "OK.",
    "All right, so let's find that desk or something.",
    "Actually, we could probably just use like the desk that we had before or.",
    "Or what we could possibly do is.",
    "We could do something totally different and see if we can put myself in a trash can.",
    "OK, so let's do this.",
    "To make a new light box and call this stream template.",
    "And then we want to go on Adobe stock here.",
    "Actually, I might just be able to just get a since it's just for stream.",
    "I'm just going to use unsplash I think for this one and I'm just going to park.",
    "OK, this isn't too bad, um?",
    "I would just like a regular path that would be nice if there was like kind of like a close up.",

    "If it works.",
    "Please work.",

    "Oh here, I don't even need to add the separate elements there together.",
    "OK.",
    "Uh, darts?",
    "You could probably throw that up there.",
    "Alright, let's just let's just work with the elements that we got so far we have.",
    "OK, so I'm going to go behind this little thing here.",
    "But I don't really know.",
    "Missy.",
    "There we go with this with this kind of sneak it up in there.",
    "Perfect, that works Alright and let's add our pool table here.",
    "It's going to have that one coming in from like the corner here like this.",
    "All right and then, what else did we put in here?",
    "All we got some signs and stuff.",
    "OK, I got some barrels.",
    "I'm going to put on the right here.",
    "Just to cover up that little mistake area there.",
    "And then we'll maybe, maybe you can throw on behind the pool table over here.",
    "No.",
    "OK, let's get a.",
    "Is there a wall?",
    "Throw that in there.",
    "I use, uh, I use OBS, just the original BS mark.",
    "That's about that's about all I use right now.",
    "I don't think I can use streamlabs yet.",
    "I don't think that it's like set up or anything.",
    "Alright, that should.",
    "That should work.",
    "Let's see wine.",
    "Breath.",
    "And maybe will do this one too, right here.",
    "OK, that should work alright, so now I'm just going to add those to my elements here.",
    "I'm going to put them underneath everything.",
    "I just kind of want to create walls here.",
    "Actually, you know it.",
    "I think we're just going to add a wall and then just like place windows, I think it's so much easier to do that 'cause we're going to search window.",
    "And it gives us a lot of options for this kind of stuff.",
    "So we're just going to like redo that wall.",
    "What are some nice looking like industrial windows here?",
    "Like I don't want anything with the bottom thing right?",
    "And these look like house windows.",
    "Huh, OK, I think we have to pick one of these ones.",
    "AO check the perspective.",
    "Yeah, the perspectives aren't right yet.",
    "Ebony, I'm just kind of like placing them the pool tables.",
    "Like really wonky an it's just 'cause I gotta.",
    "I think I have to redo like the flooring too.",
    "Actually, I might be able to just find like A.",
    "It's 'cause I really want to like.",
    "OK, if I go to my green screen, let's go to my green screen for a second.",
    "I really want to keep that so like the clouds going in the background.",
    "I really like that idea, but it's just like.",
    "I need to somehow figure out how to do a window now, like behind me, so I'm going to do a window like here and then the rest is just going to be walls.",
    "Like right across so I still have a little bit of that window space, but I just.",
    "I don't know, so let's go.",
    "Let's go back to the mainstage here.",
    "I'm just going to see if I could find like an empty room.",
    "Actually, you know there's just going to take my chances with Adobe Stock's.",
    "It's so much easier just to find things on Adobe Stock then is on any other site.",
    "Like if I search empty room, it's going to give me like all empty rooms.",
    "See like, why can't it just do this?",
    "OK, uhm?",
    "So let's see if it'll match the perspective.",
    "Actually, this is not too too bad.",
    "I'm going to accept this.",
    "So let me see if this matches our perspective for a second.",
    "OK.",
    "OK, and then if we go on pixel squid here.",
    "Oh yeah, 'cause I rotated it.",
    "Just not not matching.",
    "I said thing about these 3D elements is out there just like long key.",
    "See if I can return it to its perspective.",
    "I don't think that that's working.",
    "We were coming from like.",
    "You know the countryside, so we said, OK, you know what?",
    "It's one night how much damage could socks, possibly due to this empty house, completely empty house?",
    "How much damage could a cat do?",
    "So we made sure we already thought about it were like K.",
    "He's gonna get in this room in this room in this room.",
    "So we already blocked off literally all those doors, all those passageways, everything.",
    "We literally blocked it off.",
    "We put like a bookcase right up against the door opening so that he could not let go around it at all.",
    "This He managed to get around the bookcase somehow.",
    "Don't know.",
    "I still don't know how he got around the bookcase.",
    "And then.",
    "He got up inside the ceiling of the House and it was like, you know it was like ceilings that they have in the school with like all like the panels and everything like that.",
    "Oh my goodness, it's like he likes stepped on them and like quickly stepped off so that it would fall and he did it like a whole line.",
    "There's like probably.",
    "Way over I don't like 15 ceiling tiles, all completely fallen down.",
    "The whole ceiling was like collapsed everything.",
    "And I was like, Oh my God, one night one night away an he managed to get in the ceiling of a house and destroy the ceiling like completely.",
    "I have no idea how.",
    "No idea how.",
    "And then when I brought him to the new house.",
    "He uhm, why have delay?",
    "You aren't playing games to people ghosting.",
    "Delay what do you mean delay?",
    "I'm not, I'm not a.",
    "There's probably a little bit of a delay on the stream like it's probably like like.",
    "Like 20 seconds or something.",
    "It's pretty long.",
    "But I will get to like some of the comments and stuff.",
    "I'm just going to keep going, but but yeah, there's a second time where, uhm?",
    "We allowed him in the new house and everything like that and then we didn't block off one room and then he ended up getting inside the wall.",
    "So he was like adventuring around the walls of the house and.",
    "I don't know man, it's uh.",
    "Socks is a crazy cat.",
    "Crazy crazy cat.",
    "That's going to be smaller.",
    "I'm going to change this.",
    "With that Perfect, OK, now I'm going to.",
    "I'm going to start blending so this table.",
    "Let's see this table first.",
    "And K.",
    "Clip mask OK, I'm just going to do the highlights.",
    "Yeah, there's.",
    "There's just a stream delay.",
    "I don't.",
    "I don't know how long the stream delay is, but there's always a delay with streams and I don't know.",
    "I think it's just because the software that I'm I'm using two at the same time.",
    "And it's going to do overlay here.",
    "OK, that doesn't look too too too too bad.",
    "Welcome.",
    "Welcome to my bar.",
    "Would anybody like anything to?",
    "Would anybody like anything in the bar today?",
    "It's all on me and we just opened.",
    "We look at we are fully operating bar online.",
    "This looks kinda cool though, right?",
    "Like managing my own bar.",
    "Yes, we have a lot of choices today.",
    "We could go out here.",
    "Let me grab.",
    "I wish I could like grab elements here.",
    "Have a coffee.",
    "We make coffee here too.",
    "It's hard because I have to like.",
    "Like slightly like Ben down like this.",
    "At like Neil down here, I'm going to kneel it.",
    "OK, I'm going to kneel and I'm going to just make my green screen like a little bit bigger.",
    "No, you can't do that.",
    "I have to like literally.",
    "Get like this.",
    "OK, perfect.",
    "Welcome to the bar welcome.",
    "So what are y'all think?",
    "But how do you like?",
    "My bar is pretty cool.",
    "I like I'm just chilling out in here to sound good time I don't I can't like necessarily walk outside of the bar.",
    "Is it like?",
    "Gets rid of it, but like if I get a whole green screen room then like stuff like this would actually work pretty good.",
    "And you can like kind of make your own scenes and like and like movies and stuff like that, right?",
    "But I don't have a a wide screen webcam so I can't really like.",
    "I can't really like do anything right.",
    "I can't like make it so that I can walk out there, but.",
    "Pretty soon I mean like I can try and do like other like other stuff.",
    "Uh, with it, but I just need to like a whole room basically as like a green screen.",
    "Which will I'll probably get there, but.",
    "But for now this is kind of cool, right?",
    "Like I would need something to like lean on, like I don't know if I have like.",
    "I guess I can.",
    "Use this like stool.",
    "Then I have here.",
    "Going to lay down.",

    "But, uh, but yeah, so there's people.",
    "There's people socializing in here like you know there.",
    "There Hannah good time and I don't know we might.",
    "We might use this scene.",
    "I'll probably set up one like.",
    "You know later something that we could mess around with and then we can start doing like stuff like this where I'm just kind of like editing the scene for you and then.",
    "Throwing it in the obvious here, obviously you have some like smaller details like like if you look down below like the shadowing to the counter here like it's not correct 'cause I don't know why it added like the white line around it at the figure out what that is.",
    "But but it's pretty good.",
    "It's not too bad.",
    "I would have to probably put like A.",
    "Like a shadow overlay or something in in the corner over here so that it kind of goes over top of me.",
    "But Yeah, my stand back here though.",
    "It kinda I can probably bring it up actually late Wednesday.",
    "OK, so let's go bring this down.",
    "And then.",
    "Very now I look like unproportionate to like.",
