    "I was just kind of.",
    "Going through the Internet, uhm, and I saw people using blending modes with two colors and it was really interesting to me so.",
    "Usually you think kind of.",
    "If we use the multiplier.",
    "Blending mode, you can kind of create what would be like a print effect, so let me open up my.",
    "Connection here.",
    "Sure.",
    "We are where we want to be.",
    "Perfect again.",
    "Also, I added closed captions.",

    "Which is fine, but.",
    "Just wanted to share that alright.",
    "Let's do this thing.",
    "So what I'm going to do here is first kind of start picking out some colors just to see how they interact.",
    "So I'm going to create.",
    "And multiply layer.",
    "And I'm going to create like.",
    "I use it.",
    "Um, to connect my iPad to the computer.",
    "That way I can draw.",
    "Like using my iPad as like basically awake Wakeham Wakeham tablet uhm.",

    "About this one kind of idea that I.",
    "Had was the possibly do stuff for the Last of Us Part 2.",
    "Play draw face and stuff but.",
    "No, maybe I will.",
    "So last time I used blending colors like.",
    "So I'd have a color.",
    "And then I'd have a color underneath it.",
    "And then.",
    "On them.",
    "But multiply, so then you get three colors.",
    "I think it'd be interesting to do.",
    "That again today.",
    "I am looking at my.",
    "Images I have saved the have any suggestions of what I should draw today?",
    "Flowers Flowers is definitely on.",
    "On the.",
    "But the high part of it.",
    "Who is Siri?",
    "Um?",
    "An instrument keep a draw this folder where it's things that I want to draw.",
    "Let's see if there's anything in there this morning.",

    "And I don't know why 'cause we didn't stay up that late last night.",
    "I'm just gonna start sketching some things.",
    "And just kind of see where it takes takes us.",
    "Um?",
    "Sometimes.",
    "You just gotta.",
    "Start drying even if you don't know.",
    "Why you're going to draw?",
    "Honestly, half the time the hard part.",
    "Is figuring out.",
    "What you're going to draw and then.",
    "Going for it because.",
    "It takes guts to, you know.",
    "Put.",
    "Ink to paper.",
    "I guess.",
    "You're drawing.",
    "Digitally, you not really putting into paper, but.",
    "I'm.",
    "You are.",
    "Taking her.",
    "Taking steps.",

    "So.",
    "I'll have to go through.",
    "And like those colors.",
    "But this is a great way to like see what works.",
    "Before you dive into.",
    "Drawing fully now these are similar so.",
    "You can see that.",
    "So it's cool is when you do this.",
    "Really, you're using two colors.",
    "But it's creating three colors.",
    "Uh.",
    "So what I can do here is actually duplicate that layer and we're going to do.",
    "Is place that here and then I'm going to decide on another color that we can use.",
    "By locking the transparency here.",
    "What I can do is pick a color.",
    "Let's try like.",
    "Try of her.",
    "I don't really use purple much.",
    "I think it might be interesting to try that so.",
    "You know option delete.",
    "Not shows us the purple would look like.",
    "Um?",
    "Super bright.",
    "But if you can see it because this purple tone is so different than all of the colours you do get.",
    "You get 3.",
    "Colors for each one, but here the red and yellow.",
    "These are.",
    "These aren't different enough, so I'm going to try something real quick, but we're going to merge.",
    "Group so that these can this be?",
    "Please leave and then when you take it of- you draw the multiplier there.",
    "You You Yeah.",
    "And this is kinda cool 'cause you can also like create art that kind of has a reso graph.",
    "Feeling which is.",
    "Um?",
    "Bush is cool.",
    "I think what I can do for that.",
    "I think you can.",
    "Actually this might be kinda cool.",
    "Or we're just going to experiment today.",
    "I'm gonna come over here.",
    "And I'm going to go to my.",
    "Let that happen.",
    "And let's see what this might look like if I can find.",
    "The dots.",
    "So many brushes.",
    "Yes.",
    "I guess a little too small.",
    "To the medium.",
    "Let's just do it.",
    "That looks like.",
    "So.",
    "Because.",
    "Because this is, let's see, let's put this on there.",
    "There again.",
    "So I could even like do a whole illustration and then.",
    "Um?",
    "Do this over it.",
    "And.",
    "Do it create almost.",
    "Kind of a root Reso graph.",
    "Type look where it's Allie, perfectly printed.",
    "Um, and I'm using a mask.",
    "That I'm getting that.",
    "That I'm getting that look.",
    "Enter push Kyle if it's cool to be able to experiment and push.",
    "Your look further.",
    "Let's try this.",
    "So these are some brushes I have.",
    "Are there any that you like that that are your favourites?",
    "That you're seeing right now.",
    "Um?",
    "I mean, I do like this one.",
    "There's one more I want to try out because.",

    "It's like 2 ish PM.",
    "Two or three.",
    "I don't know, um.",
    "Yeah, I'm playing with kind of working with the blending mode to create my palette.",
    "Um, so I will be using two colors.",
    "But essentially it's three.",
    "Uhm, I think earlier before you got on I.",
    "Was doing I was playing with also using.",
    "Um?",

    "Thanks Chris.",
    "Chris says yeah great combination UK based time around two-ish nice technique using the blending mode degree colors.",
    "I love like.",
    "Having that kind of magic moment happen where you didn't pick the the third color in that third color is created by those two interacting.",
    "Pretty lovely, I like it.",
    "Like it.",
    "I think I can.",
    "I do that can bring that down there.",
    "Can you don't do that with Swatch is OK.",
    "Will that create more library?",
    "Do you know why?",
    "It doesn't.",

    "So usually I stream.",
    "A stream I usually stream about.",
    "Maybe?",
    "And that just watch.",
    "Think I'll put all the multiplier layers on this side.",
    "And then maybe I'll bring in white to separate it.",
    "That way everything to the right is.",
    "Bottom layer and everything to the left is top layer.",
    "I guess it doesn't really matter 'cause I can always go through and.",
    "Change it.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Call This over here.",
    "Yo Gotti here my brains.",

    "But I think I figured out maybe if not, I'll find you color combinations.",
    "OK.",
    "We're gonna head that this looks pretty cool so I'm not going to get rid of that.",
    "Question is.",
    "What would it look like?",

    "Oh, it's not gonna work because these are not.",
    "This is what this is just for fun.",
    "He did like a light.",
    "See the way that blending works.",
    "Pretty cool, so if you were using like a pink piece of paper.",
    "Towns down everything just a little bit 'cause I have it on multiply.",
    "Um, so like if you were using a pink piece of paper, the equipment to go into it?",
    "More so than.",
    "And it would kind of blend in with that color, but if you were using.",
    "Blankets, paper.",
    "They'd be much more vibrant.",
