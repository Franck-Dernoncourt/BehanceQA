    "I thought I'll play here today.",
    "Alright alright.",
    "Let's see.",
    "OK, let's talk through this again.",
    "So basically we're designing 6 characters.",
    "The theme, the challenge is pretty broad, to be honest.",
    "You can really do anything you want, but we're basically creating 6 characters that revolve.",
    "Around these characteristics, one must be a leader, someone brave, joyful, mischievous, serious, an A wild character slash creature.",
    "So after speaking with Ed from.",
    "The discord server should not discord.",
    "If you haven't yet.",
    "We're talking about incorporating like the box idea and machines and other people do that, so I'm kind of going to try to focus on that today.",
    "I think I want to establish what the boxes for me for my 6 characters already have a pretty good idea.",
    "I think that can still keep these two and aesthetic I'm going for.",
    "That's what we're going to do.",
    "Yeah, I'm thinking I'm going to.",
    "For the wild and my joyful character there, like there like intertwined, right?",
    "Like I want the joyful too.",
    "Take control of creature and be like the creatures like the Mount for joyful when I'm also thinking is that now the creature is.",
    "This giant thing that hoax, or maybe this would be that big, but it's strong enough to Hulk like a box of mystery and the whole point of My 6 characters is that they will.",
    "Escort they like the.",
    "Well, they called like bodyguards of it and they ask Scott this box.",
    "We don't know what it is, but it's very important 'cause you guys may be looking kind of chunky and.",
    "Yeah.",
    "They look like it.",
    "You don't wanna mess with them basically right.",
    "Enough about me.",
    "How are you guys going per which guys get up to today?",
    "Who got real?",
    "Productive today.",
    "Tell me all about.",
    "The good things you did.",
    "And I'll be very proud.",
    "Oh, by the way, I'm going to have a special guest later, so you guys should stick around maybe about an hour in.",
    "I don't know.",
    "We'll see.",
    "A sticky OK, let's go.",
    "I might start.",
    "How do I do this?",
    "I might I might keep keep these guys here.",
    "I don't really do this one.",
    "I don't want that head anymore, I'll just keep these two and I'm going to design that creature now.",
    "I think the box idea, something I really have to resolve now before I go any further so I can get this static.",
    "Oh, here we go.",
    "Let's redo some stuff you guys did first, so I can still wake up a little bit more.",
    "Look up 30 minutes ago.",
    "That's like me when it's actually like me, I woke up 30 minutes ago.",
    "Finish all your class work today.",
    "Hell yeah.",
    "Hey Speaking of classes.",
    "Our own patron classes.",
    "If you want to learn some art.",
    "Join me.",
    "Go to discord For more information.",
    "Go to my page on For more information.",
    "Can just get more information everywhere 'cause I've been posting stuff everywhere.",
    "OK.",
    "I've got my reference bored with me, so maybe I'll talk through that real quick as well.",
    "This is basically a theme of them before, but I won't explore even more.",
    "It's the eye called improbable champions.",
    "It's something actually my intro sort of has that as well.",
    "The character from that.",
    "But this is the aesthetic I'm going for.",
    "It's like an ancient tech.",
    "Civilization.",
    "So incorporating magic.",
    "And Chunky Chunky Arm and all that.",
    "I actually might base my creature of this something like this, where is something bear like that can like.",
    "Drag a gigantic box behind it.",
    "That's that's the goal.",
    "The plug, hey, you started it.",
    "You started it and check this back over here.",
    "OK, I'm so good at the plug.",
    "Like teal maybe.",
    "So in that stands out a bit more from the rest of this, yeah.",
    "Hell yeah before I want like a second area to match this as well.",
    "But before that I might just place.",
    "A little bit of silver here.",
    "To make that whole thing popping up.",
    "Oh hey, Grut Yeah man, this is a good place to talk if you want.",
    "I've been on so I don't know if you can.",
    "He been on while I've been off, but.",
    "Yeah, if you have any questions about.",
    "The op journey and all that ask it here.",
    "I'd be really happy to talk about it here.",
    "But yeah, seeing some of your past work would be really helpful for the questions you were asking.",
    "I think.",
    "What is it like 3 days ago?",
    "OK, yes I wanted this to be a bit brighter, normal italic.",
    "OK yeah, the cloth here should make that Green as well, let's see.",
    "And what are you up to, Lee?",
    "How's that rap coming along?",
    "I can hear his New Zealand accent.",
    "Wait, wait, I said it was you.",
    "Should that be green?",
    "Should I make that green?",
    "Was a weird.",
    "Should this be white?",
    "Going into desaturate.",
    "It just white for that.",
    "Think that feels better.",
    "But I will make the top one little bit funky color.",
    "Let's up the.",
    "Up all these maybe not brightness.",
    "And four Jesus is pretty funky.",
    "Who?",
    "Now, is this reduce our should huge jitter?",
    "Yeah, here we go.",
    "Stay in the same Hue.",
    "Hacks bro.",
    "Like that?",
    "If you guys wondering what I use there, it's.",
    "Brush settings going to color dynamics tennis on.",
    "And post the Hue saturation and brightness jitter.",
    "If you understand what these means and you basically understand what this does, if I turn that huge it away up, we're going to see a bunch of different colors pop up.",
    "See, but if you want to really know what colors that we want this to be, then keep that Hugh relatively low.",
    "And you should be good.",
    "I like to use it with a brick type of brush.",
    "Everyone's doing a rap bro.",
    "Until I call you bro, I never say bro.",
    "Stuff I mostly worry about is what to practice first, not withdrawing people or characters in general.",
    "I think I mentioned that I want to illustrate my stories eventually.",
    "OK, yeah, I think like Oh yeah I remember now.",
    "You kind of need that 'cause it's still dark outside.",
    "Maybe that's why it's cold and it's dark and like stream almost like didn't wake up today.",
    "But then after waking up I feel way better.",
    "Several theme of the characters, by the way.",
    "Ancient Tech basically.",
    "Let me open him up.",
    "It's good question, huh?",
    "So it's like civilization that uses ancient technology.",
    "And they're going to be.",
    "Let me see.",
    "Being weird is.",
    "Sketches.",
    "So this is the line up basically.",
    "We have our creature thing that transports the box and these are like the bodyguards basically.",
    "Yeah it is brave.",
    "Leda I could add some glowy stuff for her.",
    "I don't know what to add that yet, but will figure it out.",
    "There's anything I'm good at, it's figuring it out as I go.",
    "Thank you, wait for the big one, the big one.",
    "The big.",
    "This guy probably do him next will probably do her little sniper girl.",
    "We send it there.",
    "I think I worked on these in like order of what I like, so I like electric boy leader actually wanted to add like a beard on him to be honest.",
    "Might do that now it's giving little godey or something.",
    "Fat he needs it.",
    "Dang, Daniel.",
    "Done.",
    "Yo Pat.",
    "Which one do you guys like?",
    "Out of leader.",
    "Brave.",
    "An mischief mischievous.",
    "So I think that word wrong.",
    "I feel like I say it wrong.",
    "I feel like very forced when I say it and I don't know why is it mischievous or mischievous?",
    "Was of both correct?",
    "Square and hate squish to help.",
    "Oh, it's first correct?",
    "Hell yeah.",
    "Leaders pass Faith Hill, Yeah.",
    "We got some.",
    "Like the color, some brave cool.",
    "We got some nice everyone's got like their own favorite which is good.",
    "If I run says one that I should be concerned.",
    "I'd like Wolf.",
    "Play set the world like Pok\u00e9mon.",
    "1st.",
    "For her, I think the glowy bits.",
    "Maybe I'll just focus on the horn and the eyes for the globe.",
    "Well, not really becoming Ed, that's the second sniffle I had.",
    "Dental ever said that?",
    "Same type of cadence.",
    "Considerable pacing.",
    "What are you talking about?",
    "We talked about was.",
    "Win the world with Miss Chievous.",
    "Right Americans let me know how your 4th of July was.",
    "You can learn a lot about character design that way I think.",
    "It sounded like it was atrocious sent, but it all seriousness like I learned a lot from watching other people, not streams in particular.",
    "I watched speed paints.",
    "So I learned how to paint digitally through that and then I think the designing part just.",
    "You just try stuff to be honest, you get reference, you learn from it.",
    "You observe and study other peoples designs.",
    "And you pick up things that way.",
    "Where?",
    "Very obviously absurd.",
    "We observe a lot as humans.",
    "As humans, we observe.",
    "Ascend very robotic descent, like something very unnatural for me to say.",
    "I don't have a nice PC to draw.",
    "Photoshop barely opens.",
    "That gets a little bit harder.",
    "I do recommend.",
    "I personally think digital is like the way to go with Art Learning 'cause it's so fast.",
    "You don't have to use Photoshop, though.",
    "There are the programs like.",
    "Clip studio I heard it's pretty good.",
    "Create a maybe that less intensive on your PC or whatever you use to draw.",
    "I know I started on a laptop, so it's not impossible.",
    "Observant, that's the word I was looking for A.",
    "Your John.",
    "Johnny boy I can always look around for the programs.",
    "Yeah, that's right.",
    "Yeah, knowing your rest definitely helps.",
    "But I do recommend, I think if you have a bad PC, I would recommend.",
    "A different program over lower lower resolution.",
    "Because it's so important to have enough pixels.",
    "I can buy the boy membership right now that's.",
    "Some big Bucks right there, you better.",
    "Spend carefully.",
    "It's a whole dollar.",
    "What does it offer?",
    "The membership I think that's just to show your support.",
    "Now, if you want to talk about the mental ship.",
    "Ask the different story right there, that genders I'm going to ship.",
    "It helps you with the Taylor made.",
    "Study plan.",
    "You know life coaching for being an artist.",
    "We talk about that mental game, you know, we talk about how do you stay up there in social media?",
    "How to present yourself as an artist?",
    "Get that first job.",
    "We even offer you jobs.",
    "Kind of I do like to send some of my extra.",
    "Commission requests over to dementia shop mentor ship people.",
    "That's not a lie.",
    "I was not ready for a pitch, but that does like my.",
    "Sounds like my unprepared pitch.",
    "How is that?",
    "How would you write that out of 10?",
    "Yeah, he tried aarthy of human like yeah I did try with the job thing but not.",
    "Not the other thing meant my pitch was like, yeah, he tried.",
    "I was like no no.",
    "I thought I did OK.",
    "Seven, that's pretty good for like a sudden.",
    "I don't know where pitch.",
    "Character designing of crimes you guys recommend for beginners character designing.",
    "I think the ones I listed before before we pretty good create a CSP.",
    "Said it felt this one more I just forgot.",
    "He tried out a tent.",
    "You be, I'd say the word, but Behance is.",
    "I can plug at anytime I want.",
    "It should design with the boxes 1st as well.",
    "What it looks like.",
    "In fact, damn it, I didn't should have got some props.",
    "For inspiration button.",
    "About What kind of role with some?",
    "Some shapes.",
    "We could also do also like the creatures like stuck in the box as well, but I kind of like the whole bodyguard idea that I'm going.",
    "Welcome to just draw blockstream oh jeez that's stressful man.",
    "That don't make me prove how well I can draw boxes, I can't.",
    "I can't do no boxes.",
    "What do you guys think of my idea so far for the six characters?",
    "Sound cool is that like do you feel like this more purpose to these people now and it relates more to like a whole?",
    "There's no, there's nothing saying You have to relate it to a box, but I think if it's called like Artstation Light Box Challenge then.",
    "It's pretty.",
    "Is pretty good idea to like incorporate the box ideas somewhere at least.",
    "You guys think so?",
    "Of course you do.",
    "Every consider source, so if I had one, yeah.",
    "I was going to go in there and just do anything 'cause it doesn't mention it.",
    "Maybe that's the secret.",
    "I'm just doing like swells and like little details.",
    "I sort of relate to the detailing I'd add on my characters.",
    "Might do a few box designs is to check out.",
    "What I like more and it's sort of feel like it can open as well.",
    "Not sure how.",
    "Maybe these edges are somewhat important.",
    "And should feel like this some sort of gap here that can let this.",
    "Good luck.",
    "Without sound effect as well, exactly like that.",
    "Nice straight lines.",
    "OK, that is horrible.",
    "Back down there a bit.",
    "Man, I'm like not awake at all that did well so off.",
    "Guys like.",
    "By Oasis Not hey, if you want to like something can you please like my submission?",
    "On the challenge that would help me a lot.",
    "'cause I kind of pushes pushes people up in the.",
    "In the populist in this popular section.",
    "So if you can like that, I'd really appreciate that and like eds as well help Ed out or anyone else in the server who's joining.",
    "We should all help each other out.",
    "That's what communities are for.",
    "Thanks Matt.",
    "Yeah so it sounded like you act like the very early beginning stages of art and.",
    "To be honest, anything that you draw is really going to help you for this is my opinion.",
    "It's just you get so much mileage out of just drawing, so you know copying artwork that you like right now and understanding how that like what they do is already going to be very beneficial for you and also you have to copy things.",
    "That's one way of doing things.",
    "You could also.",
    "Practice doing your versions of some current existing art as well.",
    "So.",
    "What I mean by that is like it's basically using reference, so you have your reference and you change up some stuff to make it noticeably different, but you heavily rely on that reference to help you create that outlook.",
    "Studies yesterday useful.",
    "I think the issue with that is that's slowing down the mileage that I'm talking about.",
    "At least I find out for me like that's not something that everyone deals with, but study is is pretty boring and he is an I think this starting stages of art should be very fun.",
    "Because, you know, it's a brand new skill that you're learning.",
    "You should be interesting in just trying it.",
    "And like you know, drawing different styles and copying those different styles.",
    "And even if you draw bad, it's OK because you just started so.",
    "Yeah, if you focus on that mileage then you should be all good.",
    "So basically to ask your question, what should you practice?",
    "When you want to draw people and characters is to draw people in characters, copy them for now and then, yeah, that's what I would do.",
    "You know there's all the other resources that are free right now.",
    "Like drop box.",
    "A bunch of YouTube videos you can watch how people will go through the process of that.",
    "But yeah, there's a few things you want to think about as well while you copy.",
    "And while you learn and.",
    "You just want to notice like certain proportions and all that like.",
    "There's a lot of resources out there talking about like how many, how to measure proportions in a character, for example.",
    "So you can use like the head as your measurement tool, and the body can be split into different numbers of heads with width and the height.",
    "So once you learn things like that, you'll be aware of it when you start copying other artwork, you'll think of it as well.",
    "And then eventually, once you've drawn enough, once you've copied enough, you'll start to.",
    "Remember.",
    "What it's like to draw characters in certain proportions so you don't have to rely heavily on that reference.",
    "Now, by the way, like when I say copy doesn't mean you copy it and then like you posted online over saying that you did it yourself, that's definitely not what you want to do.",
    "You just copy it for your own sake.",
    "You're drawing for your own sake.",
    "You don't have to like post it anywhere.",
    "Low commitment.",
    "Just just there for you.",
    "You know self learning.",
    "Guidance as good as it is I think you know paying for it at the moment, I don't think it's too necessary because this is so many free resources right now.",
    "So yeah, and all those videos is resources can help you give you ideas what you should do.",
    "For mileage.",
    "Yeah, like even if you if you like what I'm drawing, you just want to copy the head or something easy.",
    "I didn't notice yesterday, so now I have to ask you guys.",
    "How's your 4th of July?",
    "What do you do?",
    "What do you eat?",
    "Wait, no, that's not the day you eat stuff, is it?",
    "That's just that's just the day celebrating.",
    "Do stuff I guess.",
    "Is that right?",
    "This is all one layer, it is now.",
    "I had an old layered before.",
    "Um?",

    "I live in.",
    "Do you guys just.",
    "Party.",
    "But then I really hope you didn't party because.",
    "'cause you know?",
    "I don't even have to say it.",
    "Where can you join the mental ship?",
    "Could you www.payment.com/fashion designs or you can go to my link tree and find my pager on?",
    "So smooth hell yeah.",
    "Didn't even rehearse that one.",
    "Hey honestly though you can go to my description below.",
    "He can find my picture on there as well.",
    "OK, I have to make this way less static here.",
    "It's so like I do this on you later though.",
    "Just in case I've screwed up, might need to cloth reference as well, but will try to wing it first.",
    "We didn't really do anything on the 4th.",
    "Yeah.",
    "But you must do you doing here on the 4th.",
    "Even sylveon independence.",
    "Oh really, no extra, like dinner or anything.",
    "We have good dinner every day, don't you?",
    "So you like, what's the difference?",
    "Already doing that, neighbors.",
    "All know where they potting.",
    "That be pretty bad.",
    "If they were OK, I do need some cloth reference I think.",
    "How do I look for this?",
    "I think my fashion board reference would have some stuff.",
    "Get ready for some like boys.",
    "Maybe should cut it off right at the edge.",
    "I was like I thought I found the perfect reference.",
    "I was like Oh my God, this is just like my design.",
    "This was like a thought was like yes yes yes yes.",
    "And then I see this bottom part.",
    "It doesn't hit the floor.",
    "My damn it.",
    "I just do that, maybe just wanted to hit the floor.",
    "Good day hello.",
    "Young squish Well, it turns this looks alright.",
    "Green, the green, a little bit more.",
    "Maybe this guy could be more blueish armor.",
    "It's kind of cool.",
    "Yeah, there are quite a few advantages to selections like this.",
    "I think well, one speed when you're doing this, 'cause like.",
    "And like how clean it is and how you can if you're not making selections 'cause you're painting one layer, then you also missing out on reselecting stuff later on.",
    "'cause now I can just re select this whenever I want all the skin tones.",
    "Um, or if I made like a whole shadow path, which I will do later.",
    "Like this?",
    "Then I can select all the shadows.",
    "And then only edit the shadow area.",
    "Very useful.",
    "Or you boy.",
    "You, Amy.",
    "Hey, stay hydrated.",
    "I want to give him OK.",
    "Now it's time for like the secondary armored color.",
    "Whoa, what's happening there?",
    "Hey.",
    "Stop that.",
    "I think I want to make these negative spaces too.",
    "Oh yes, look at that value thing.",
    "So yeah, I was saying you can change color right without changing value and that's bad.",
    "We don't want to do that.",
    "Why do I want that to be gaps?",
    "I think that's a little bit too noisy there.",
    "If it's gap, so we'll keep it.",
    "But you can see in black-and-white.",
    "When I edited those colors.",
    "We're getting slightly different values as well.",
    "So what does that mean so?",
    "Instead of everything being just one tone like this.",
    "Why is that?",
    "I'll cut down with that on the same layer, isn't it?",
    "OK, 1 second Yeah.",
    "But basically instead of getting just one tone.",
    "Of value.",
    "Like this?",
    "With Sunday at different variations of Gray in here from introducing skin tones and some of the highlight metal.",
    "And I'm going to do even more of this to make it look more interesting.",
    "It's Pizza man who's Pizza Man?",
    "Yeah this guys your friendly slice of Pizza he wants.",
    "He wants to take the first bite.",
    "Masquerade vibes with the bird looking mask.",
    "Hell yeah.",
    "Kanichi konnichiwa hey.",
    "That's not the right war.",
    "That's why, but that's not the right one, so you don't actually speak Japanese.",
    "You can't fool me.",
    "If you want to write konnichiwa like that, you actually have to put her at the end up instead of war.",
    "Did you know that?",
    "I don't think so.",
    "Hello.",
    "I want this out the face to pop right?",
    "So what I've got so far?",
    "The colors are very complementary in terms of the armor, so if I want to make this part pop.",
    "Then it's gotta.",
    "It's going to be something orange like.",
    "So I might go 'cause I want to contrast against the properly properly blue.",
    "So maybe somewhere like here will make it really pop pop.",
    "Dang pop up.",
    "I don't want that one maybe.",
    "Well, that's kind of interesting.",
    "Pretty interesting so it too bright for me, though we are working in shadows for now.",
    "Maybe they should make it pop that much either too, like.",
    "Not compete with and have too many Hughes.",
    "Then Well, maybe I need to turn down the green.",
    "Are there we go?",
    "I think that was the Hue I was looking for.",
    "No doubt I wanted, though that's all good man.",
    "Pick up that dual lingo and you'll get there.",
    "I actually did do a lingo for I checked out Duolingo's Japanese course.",
    "Copy it, you'll see like how I simplify certain things, certain features and things.",
    "Honest, complicated as it looks when you break it down to each tiny section.",
    "There's a lot of times you can, you know.",
    "Start to learn.",
    "As well, they always ask questions.",
    "In discord, the cycle path says.",
    "OK, we've got our flats down now.",
    "We can start to add some shadow.",
    "Oh yeah, one more thing.",
    "You should probably learn if you want to do digital art in particular is get get to understand what we talk about in.",
    "The tool by using photo shop, so understand what it means.",
    "When I open like new layers, clipping masks.",
    "Yeah, I think I'll just list some essential things that you should probably learn about so there's layers clipping mask up, masking.",
    "In general adjustment layers, and the different options you can pick in here.",
    "I mostly use Hue, saturation, color, balance levels, curves, an gradient Maps, or yeah, gradients brush brush settings.",
    "I think all these are pretty important.",
    "And you'll selection types will be useful.",
    "Keep it simple at slot yet, so I think all you really need is.",
    "Your brush and your layers I think.",
    "Those are the main things you should probably learn about.",
    "You don't have to go crazy.",
    "You have to get like a crazy brush like I don't know whatever this one is, you don't.",
    "You don't need that, just your simple round brush does a lot, but make sure you understand things in your brush settings.",
    "'cause that's pretty important.",
    "You definitely want to have at least transfer on with pen pressure.",
    "And yet hit me up with any questions during the stream.",
    "If you have any pop up ads, you try some stuff.",
    "I'll be happy to help.",
    "But yeah, that's from colors down, huh?",
    "Other colors, let's get some lighting down.",
    "This is where things start to go.",
    "Pop pop man.",
    "This is multiply.",
    "And.",
    "Will go cool shadows.",
    "And if anyone else has questions about art stuff.",
    "So let me know.",
    "Hit me up.",
    "This is definitely what I'm doing now for these fish.",
    "My practice to digital, and I'm currently on iPad drawing on Glass kind of throws me off, so I figure I should get over that quickly with this.",
    "Hell yeah, that's the right way to think.",
    "Understand what medium you want to work with early and practice that.",
    "I don't think that I don't know.",
    "There's a lot of mixed information on this, but I'm you know, I'm very certain, for me at least, that understanding my medium helped me greatly and I don't even really work in digital at all, so I don't touch digital.",
    "And that hasn't affected me in anyway, but.",
    "Well, I say that after I've had like a lot of experience with traditional as a kid, so maybe there are some advantages to early learning with your traditional medium.",
    "Maybe it's faster, maybe it builds confidence, so if you, if you find tutorials that say you should probably do this in traditional.",
    "Then maybe you should do it in traditional, like I think there are some exercises in drop box that's about building confidence and and steady line work and those might be pretty essential to do in traditional.",
    "But yeah, getting used to getting used to drawing on the iPad isn't a bad thing and iPads a great tool for art.",
    "I think it might be a bit slower for me, but it's definitely doable if I want to make it like.",
    "You know my work working.",
    "Medium Hard rough so faithful hard round buddy.",
    "That's the brush you need.",
    "I started off with a lot of Anime Style Art.",
    "'cause That's, uh, I think a lot of people get inspired to draw from watching anime.",
    "They want to draw their favorite characters and those main.",
    "I'll definitely inspired to draw like.",
    "Dragon Ball characters.",
    "Naruto stuff.",
    "When I was younger so I picked up drawing as a kid.",
    "And.",
    "It was mainly that.",
    "Started like doing a little bit of photo shop when I was around 12 or 13 and it was like that for.",
    "Just like a year or so.",
    "And then I gave it up to do other things because I felt like at that time I didn't know about the gaming industry and that you could design characters with cool swords and weapons and all that to do to be in games.",
    "I thought doing art meant you postings in gallery's.",
    "And how people buy them and you'll pour until your dead.",
    "I thought that's what it meant to be an artist I like now there's no future for that so I just I just dropped out from like between 15 until I was like.",
    "Until I saw.",
    "Video online about Blizzard and half stones and how.",
    "People do paintings for those.",
    "And then I was like, wait a second.",
    "That's like a job and I looked into it and I saw this like character designers as well.",
    "People didn't really like the odd I suit could potentially become like.",
    "Game stuff as I told them so I picked it up again when I was 23.",
    "And yeah, I didn't go to University or anything for this.",
    "I tried to, I didn't enjoy it.",
    "I think it's very slow in Australia if you want to learn that over here, it's not worth it.",
    "So I did online study by myself.",
    "Um?",
    "Picked up a mental ship with Anthony Jones.",
    "And.",
    "Yeah, I got my first job in two years after two years of self study.",
    "Coffee time with Jeff.",
    "That's Leica, Leica.",
    "Shorter version.",
    "Of my story, only go more in depth I can.",
    "Feel free to ask me anything about any particular.",
    "Time period you want to know about.",
    "'cause there's a lot.",
    "Yeah, there's a lot of information between that.",
    "You know, we could probably talk about it anyway, since.",
    "Something else we talked about today.",
    "I have a few stories.",
    "I think I told it to some of you guys are ready.",
    "I'll tell it again so.",
    "When I didn't know what I wanted to or like, there's like a period when I wasn't sure how I wanted to approach learning concept art, and I was like confused.",
    "Like A lot of people.",
    "With their approach and how to get there?",
    "An I applied full University.",
    "That's like it's like one of those.",
    "This is not a University specifically for.",
    "Now I spent two years learning stuff.",
    "Will sending University specifically for animation.",
    "It was one of like Sydney's.",
    "Bigger universities like one of the Big Three universities and they offered a brand new animation course like this the first year they opened, so that's pretty good timing.",
    "So I applied for that.",
    "I only just started.",
    "Painting at that time and I even have the paintings that I'm referring to, and I use that as like My Portfolio.",
    "I'm ready to have that portfolio to be honest.",
    "Oh boy, you guys want to see this?",
    "I don't think I've ever shown in this part 'cause I forgot that I have this portfolio.",
    "Let me try to find it.",
    "Oh, I did my first pop for you ever for when I went to.",
    "US only get anything out of it though, but I do have that.",
    "But I want to find this other one, the one that's even earlier.",
    "I really want to see it.",
    "Up It was my it was the one that I applied for us.",
    "Yeah, that cause.",

    "Seriously, coffee sniper will have will be like up here.",
    "I'll have like Mike, reach down here and I have joyful on top of creature and then we have like all three other ones, kind of standing around.",
    "I think that's a pretty good way to set it up.",
    "It'll look pretty cool as well in presentation.",
    "Um?",
    "Hum.",
    "Yeah, I would think to draw this to carefully, yet 'cause I actually think.",

    "He's like sitting there.",
    "And this is all sort of joined.",
    "2.",
    "The big.",
    "Box here I think the box should have some perspective as well.",
    "And I'm doing all this in one layer, hold on.",
    "Let's check this underneath.",
    "So the box will be like here.",
    "This is what they transporting.",

    "So connected here.",
    "And we have one more like toll character here.",
    "And one more character up here.",
    "He's like sniper.",
    "I did not look pretty cool, that's that's my 6 characters.",
    "It'll kind of small though.",
    "Is that bad?",
    "I think I want more focus on the characters.",
    "Hum.",
    "I could do something else I could have.",
    "I could do something like this guy has like a floating.",
    "Box.",
    "On him and is like a special creature.",
    "It could just be tide onto him as well.",
    "That's that's the cargo.",
    "Then we have.",
    "Sniper girl.",
    "And.",
    "Sneaky guy.",
    "Are they optimal shell of the same height?",
    "Maybe I could make make him smaller then.",
    "'cause I want to go to fill tall.",
    "His kind of big.",
    "It should be about that scale.",
    "Maybe he has to be smaller.",
    "I've also used creator on and off for a bit.",
    "Yeah and release myself but.",
    "I thought of it and let people use it.",
    "All right guys, let's take a poll.",
    "Very important question.",
    "Ultimate question.",
    "Yet this is like a dual die.",
    "I you.",
    "Around brush person.",
    "Or square brush person.",
    "Shout it out in chat.",
    "No judgment here, but ultimate question.",
    "And I'm just saying if your if your square brush then yeah we don't appreciate your kind.",
    "Square.",
    "Square round all.",
    "You converted me to the Round.",
    "Hell Yeah round is so good.",
    "Round AF they almost make it was maybe say the F word.",
    "So close I say.",
    "This is a very PG stream alright, I'm very controlled.",
    "No swearing.",
    "Just put my shadow color here so I can.",
    "Pick on this when I need it.",
    "Here's what I think of people who use round brushes like hell.",
    "Yes, like you understand what you're doing.",
    "Good control.",
    "You can pick up your textures and all that from the round brush.",
    "Awesome.",
    "Square rush now.",
    "It's like, in my opinion, is like.",
    "Is pretentious trying to be like a traditional painter and you lose control and your old wacky.",
    "That's what I think of round square rush uses.",
    "Wacky people meant just kidding.",
    "But yeah, I just prefer round.",
    "I just feel like the controls so much better.",
    "Like you don't have a weird long or short edge.",
    "It's never weird corner to work with if you want to get like a nice.",
    "Tight.",
    "Troll on the brush, just turn it smaller.",
    "Yeah, you get that nice control.",
    "Square brush.",
    "Now.",
    "I judge.",
    "I said I do like to whip out the square brush every now and then.",
    "Would even brush always use always use round brush?",
    "I can't look around this brushes.",
    "Man, I could put this.",
    "I could put this brush on a football field and people would know what to do with this.",
    "That's how around this is Alright.",
    "I could like throw it in a possible caught in there like hell yeah, slam dunk that.",
    "Here's the thing people do with lighting that I would talk about real quick as well.",

    "You don't have to wait for your lawn.",
    "If you see us in voice chat, you can jump in and.",
    "Watch some other people and see their feedback and learn from that.",
    "'cause I think that's pretty important.",
    "Other people have overlapping issues.",
    "That can be resolved just by seeing someone else is feedback.",
    "And the more friends, the merrier.",
    "I really want to read my goal though.",
    "Yeah, discord state.",

    "I'm like I'm laughing 'cause I'm hesitant to show some of the other ones, but I'll show it.",
    "This was in there.",
    "When I color suddenly changed, you guys see that.",
    "Um?",
    "This was in here.",
    "This stuff all cringe.",
    "This is in there.",
    "My first concept cheese.",
    "Yikes.",

    "Professional level stuff man.",
    "I think that's it.",
    "That's all the pages.",
    "Know this logo JC.",
    "Oh geez, just nothing that bad, that's OK.",
    "Oh old is old.",
    "I hold on let me get that story board again.",
    "OK yeah, look at that logo man, that's his JC there.",

    "Ann What I was told at the interview was like.",
    "'cause that guy had something against anyway.",
    "So he was like he saw this and he thought it was animated.",
    "Some reason it's like not even close.",
    "It was like you should take this stuff and hide it under your bed.",
    "That's what he said to me I remember.",
    "And then, like the beginning of the interviews, so that kind of set the whole tone for everything.",
    "And I'll say, OK.",
    "Um?",
    "That's not very cool and I like I didn't really enjoy the interview the whole time.",
    "And I left.",
    "I was thinking like, OK, yeah, definitely didn't make make it into the University because of this guy, but it didn't turn out that I got offered.",
    "Position in the animation cool spot I was like so mad at what he said that unlike his there's a few things that annoy me about this one.",

    "And get a job.",
    "Before any of his students will.",
    "So I set two years as my goal to get a job.",
    "Just to beat like anyone or anything that he had to offer in his stupid course.",
    "And yeah, I did.",
    "And now here's another thing he said to me.",
    "No, during his his presentation for that animation called feels like if like he had a slide shirt, right?",
    "Um?",
    "He said if you do like life drawing.",
    "And if you just like don't do any of this stuff and you post stuff like pictures of.",
    "Digital like models instead of real life ones.",
    "So you do any of that and it's useless.",
    "You have to do like the real life ones and he was like laughing and mocking people who do digital digital studies.",
    "An like I always like one did but like now like.",
    "I don't doubt at all that like digital works.",
    "If you want to do that kind of study, I learned I've learned a lot from looking at digital models.",
    "If anything, I'd say digital models are better because in real life you go if you go to life drawing.",
    "Brave doesn't mean he has to be.",
    "Toll Getting bit chunky.",
    "OK, I think that's a pretty good scale.",
    "But do that might 'cause then when it's presented together?",
    "And look bigger now so I won't like.",
    "'cause the issue is.",
    "You have to imagine how it's presented to people and if you have like that gigantic box like this idea.",
    "We're going to have tiny people, and the focus will be too much on that box.",
    "That isn't really a character, so I want to make sure these guys stick out as well in presentation.",
    "So if I make the box smaller, it's Tide to this thing.",
    "Whatever he is is looking kind of kind of good.",
    "Then that means everyone here will look bigger as well.",
    "Who is the special guest you'll see in like 40 minutes?",
    "The creature is actually one of the characters as well.",
    "That's one of the.",
    "Where is my list?",
    "So you need a wild character slash creature.",
    "Um?",
    "Not actually did write transport here.",
    "I didn't think of it.",
    "As in transporting the box.",
    "But yeah.",
    "So they definitely need to stand out as well.",
    "I don't want to have characters.",
    "One in front of the other.",
    "In fact, I might have to make him sort of standard like.",
    "Show his like full body some more.",
    "Funny faces bedtime.",
    "Yeah alright.",
    "Windsor.",
    "How long, how long can you wait?",
    "Healthy weight nano.",
    "What's the?",
    "What's the latest bedtime for you?",
    "OK, I think yeah, this is the case.",
    "I'm going to be designing the creature now instead.",
    "10 AM.",
    "But 10:00 AM for who?",
    "Ogden UT.",
    "Thomas Thomas Ricky.",
    "If that's your real name.",
    "Unless we should do like a cute looking character or like.",
    "Yeah, I want to feel like it's not meant to be tamed and then it got tamed.",
    "That's my plan.",
    "I have to load some Pinterest boards.",
    "So open this this and this.",
    "Sorry for the lag.",
    "Areas haven't drawn anything yet today.",
    "I have no real idea for this creature.",
    "Something I've noticed a lot.",
    "See, I'm like Falvey covering up certain areas with shadow.",
    "I think people don't control their lighting well enough like this.",
    "I think if it was done by.",
    "Um?",
    "Some newbie artists they would like.",
    "Add shadows across.",
    "The edge is only.",
    "And then everything ends up looking flat.",
    "Something like this like they see every component.",
    "And they saw satellite it like this edge edge edge edge.",
    "Because the lights coming from the top right, top, left right so I gotta Add all these edge shadows.",
    "But then there are whole forms that like will not be facing the light source.",
    "Areas like in here it's just being covered by this whole edge here, so if you want things to feel more 3D, you have to understand.",
    "You'll forms an your lighting an some big booty like bold moves like this is necessary.",
    "Don't just shadow along the edges like this, that's bad.",
    "And the way to understand how to get to this stage is too.",
    "You know, create a sphere might be useful.",
    "I'll do it now even.",
    "Is it so quick?",
    "So I'll do a sphere that's in the same light source as.",
    "As a as a man.",
    "I'll dude.",
    "Wait, what we're doing?",
    "And you notice like to make this feel spherical, there's going to be a lot of.",
    "Area that's covered in shadow.",
    "So that's going to be same as algi, right light from the top left shadow on this side.",
    "This whole areas of discover his shadow.",
    "So if you think about this in a 3D form.",
    "Let's relate it to like this shoulder armor.",
    "I want it to be round right the way I've drawn it.",
    "So if it is round, there's going to be areas that are heavily covered in shadow an we have to determine if it's which edge on the sphere is corresponding to.",
    "The plane of the object where trying to light and if that areas in shadow then that means we should be.",
    "Putting all that in Shadow, and in this case I think I should have a little bit more, so I'm just going to push that across a little bit with the gradient.",
    "And yet, like see how this is like.",
    "I'm imagining this has like curvature on this, right?",
    "It's like this round, so if it comes around like this will be similar to like this area of a sphere so.",
    "This should all be Leslie Shadow.",
    "I'm going to use a hot air brush do this.",
    "I'm just going to.",
    "Get back to softening.",
    "Some of the shadows later.",
    "This is the same layer.",
    "do I have the right color picked?",
    "I do?N't.",
    "OK.",
    "Yeah, so this will help us think about forms a lot better.",
    "Keep that in mind.",
    "Yeah, so again, no edge shadows.",
    "Thinking big chunks.",
    "And use that sphere.",
    "I love you 3000 thanks Ann Lamb.",
    "Pichu, I love how you explain things.",
    "I love explaining things as well.",
    "'cause I I'll bring classes right?",
    "So I run I see like issues that people run into pretty often and you know, I don't want to like people posted in discord.",
    "and I notice issues.",
    "I don't want to like.",
    "Point them out if they ask for critiques.",
    "But these common type of issues, I think it's good about.",
    "It's good to talk about in here.",
    "And if you run into any type of issues that you want to resolve, just let me know.",
    "I'm really happy to talk about it here.",
    "I'd love to help.",
    "And just because we're going into shadow in certain areas, like in here doesn't mean we have to stay in their right.",
    "Maybe some of the edges on here pop out far enough to receive some light, for example this edge.",
    "It's facing upwards according to our sphere.",
    "Things that are facing upwards can receive light.",
    "So if that's facing up enough and it is protruding outwards enough, then we can get some light hitting here.",
    "See that.",
    "So just that little change can do quite a lot.",
    "Yeah, the model you see there is just going to be like this tiny black.",
    "You didn't see anything.",
    "Oh by Nicholas.",
    "Alright, enjoy dinner.",
    "Yeah, I'll be.",
    "I'll be here for two hours.",
    "Probably not complaining about what I'm talking bout now, but I'll be here.",
    "But anyway, yeah, he was like I don't know, this guy is just super cocky I think and now is like a professional.",
    "I completely disagree with a lot of things.",
    "He says an disagree with that person being.",
    "He's a course coordinator.",
    "You know?",
    "If you're smart enough to somehow convince universities one of the top three universities to follow him an.",
    "Do a course that he coordinates, then you know good for him but.",
    "I also think it's very bad that he's representing an animation course and.",
    "He is the voice and like the guidance for young people, it's horrible.",
    "I think him as a person.",
    "His beliefs as an artist.",
    "Are not suitable for what is current like relevant.",
    "Currently relevant to the industry.",
    "Very misleading in my opinion and I hope he's not still.",
    "The person behind the course.",
    "I got good too like getting like and I think like this shaped a lot of my life like I realized.",
    "From that moment, like if I want anything.",
    "I can do it myself.",
    "I don't have to rely on anyone.",
    "And I did get petty.",
    "It's like I wanted to get good.",
    "Just the proof.",
    "People wrong.",
    "As the best feeling when you make it.",
    "And that definitely definitely shapes alot of how I am now.",
    "You can definitely work in a team relying people, but.",
    "In the end, like you're the only one you can 100% trust to get things done.",
    "It's cancel that.",
    "Another thing is like cancel anyone.",
    "And I do have like like these like dreams of like.",
    "Like they invite me to talk about industry stuff at that University and then I forgot.",
    "Yeah yeah, love too and like like they forgot about who I am or something and then I called him out and like yeah this place is pretty good but that guys don't trust him in this course is like not great.",
    "I really want to do that.",
    "I could, but not probably not.",
    "Even if they offer me like an opportunity to talk there.",
    "Anything I do that another anything except except to talk?",
    "But I'd love to.",
    "I don't know, I hope it's not leading people down the wrong path.",
    "Until mature for that Hey, you say I'm old.",
    "Yeah.",
    "It's it's becoming like I still care about that quite a lot.",
    "When I before the first job, I guess like I'll think about it.",
    "It wouldn't like haunt me, but like it really really drive me end.",
    "These days I'm coming to peace with it, it's.",
    "So what happened in part of my journey?",
    "It's an interesting story to talk about as well.",
    "Yeah, don't let the anger control your brain.",
    "But you may not feel any anger anymore.",
    "I'm like a robot.",
    "I never really was angry either.",
    "I think I accepted it as how it is, and I understood that Australia is very limited.",
    "And it was just my.",
    "Driving force to do better.",
    "That's how I, that's how I sort of perceived it, I think.",
    "The way he said that, though, no, sounds like you had a story behind letting anger control your brain.",
    "We've we're telling, telling people that this little object pops out a little bit.",
    "That is, changing the angle of the form.",
    "That's what is very important about lighting.",
    "The moth of constructive criticism.",
    "Wow, that's that's kind of cool.",
    "And yet, the more accurately you set yourself up in this stage, the better.",
    "I think you don't want to like brush past this stage too quickly in.",
    "Jump into quick rendering.",
    "If you take a time here, then that quick rendering later will be much much easier.",
    "Pop up with my explanations.",
    "Hell yeah.",
    "Yeah, I love doing the render stage like for me it's like.",
    "There's not too much thinking after.",
    "Do anyone, sort of?",
    "Second nature.",
    "And there's also so much to talk about because it's bringing in a lot of fundamentals together when you get to this stage.",
    "When I was doing the line work before windows, like just at this stage here it looks cool, but there really isn't much to talk about.",
    "An yeah, I think maybe I'll just go through the other characters and through the line work.",
    "Separately outside of stream and then come back to you like rendering.",
    "For the stream.",
    "So we have more to talk about.",
    "Yeah, love rendering.",
    "Before when I was just learning, I remember I struggled a lot with rendering and I would.",
    "Have to think a lot about it and it was less fun like I'd be rushing to finish my artwork.",
    "But these days, when I'm understanding there's so much more depth to it.",
    "So much information you have to add.",
    "And I have to think less about things that had trouble with before.",
    "I can enjoy it to the fullest.",
    "Take my time.",
    "At detail.",
    "One more thing I didn't mention about this fear is that sometimes you have to imagine there's two spheres here.",
    "Like imagine there's one more sphere on the right of this.",
    "And if there's light coming down from the left side, then this fear will be costing Shadow on the sphere on the right.",
    "So this is the case here.",
    "We have like a big shoulder armor here that's costing shadow onto this neck area and will most likely cast shadow onto part of.",
    "This headpiece Probably come all the way around here to be honest, that car shadow.",
    "Hell yeah.",
    "How long you been drawing this ohm?",
    "So I've been going through, let me find some files real quick.",
    "So here are the sketches of all the characters I think I spent around.",
    "Three sessions getting.",
    "I took like 2 so yeah, each stream is like 2 hours.",
    "I could get 2 characters done per stream, 2 characters, sketches done per stream.",
    "So I'd say one hour this is.",
    "Probably like the.",
    "2 hour Mark.",
    "I think right now.",
    "When you want to work with lines, I think you get a lot of accuracy, but it can slow you down as well.",
    "We got tired he is.",
    "Alright, you don't even show there.",
    "Get it.",
    "And shown the bed today.",
    "Hell Yeah, look at that but.",
    "There you go.",
    "Boy All right?",
    "That's how special guest.",
    "Not sure if Luffy or fat then he'll think it's kind of both when I wash him.",
    "He's like wait, wait, wait, hold on.",
    "I gotta.",
    "It's just this slightly.",
    "We don't want to see me right like this.",
    "This is face, you see it all the time, but this face.",
    "Boy at the real face.",
    "He focus on him.",
    "Hey give me more viewers.",
    "Stop slacking.",
    "Is so heavy maybe for you, but for me.",
    "Easy.",
    "50 kilograms dog.",
    "Easy carry men.",
    "Not even struggling.",
    "But yeah, like his kind of thick.",
    "But it's not really as well, it's like.",
    "You can tell he's got some chunk of him, but he's actually like really muscular.",
    "When you watch him, you can see like.",
    "The muscles.",
    "This is like the good old days when I stream on Twitch as well.",
    "And I should bring bring the Dojon.",
    "The reason Jeff is known.",
    "Got damn guys I draw.",
    "But I don't mind sharing a bit of my life, alright?",
    "We don't build of my life with you guys.",
    "Should I make this, uh, like a constant thing?",
    "Every stream is that what you guys want?",
    "There he goes.",
    "Help.",
    "I guess I guess that's because he's had enough.",
    "I don't payment off, he said.",
    "Why is that even a question?",
    "Hey, what if he wants have just thought about him when he just wants to chill?",
    "Like what if it's done with stardom?",
    "Have you ever considered him?",
    "Let you go to check this out.",
    "Play.",
    "Hey.",
    "Just like you, right?",
    "Give me all the views.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Good job.",
    "Hell yeah.",
    "You haven't even made him do anything.",
    "What do you mean?",
    "It's tiring if you in front of a camera trust me.",
    "I know.",
    "I'm looking to make him do anything on stream.",
    "He's just going to chill.",
    "That's his job.",
    "Perfect cube Thanks for drawing dragon.",
    "Dragon good Oh yeah, bomb on a stick with the dragon.",
    "Might go with the Floof instead.",
    "Is he is he industry?",
    "Oh he doesn't have an account I bet.",
    "Hey Tim, to make an account.",
    "The Hansor is up and coming for streaming.",
    "Maybe he should stream, huh?",
    "She was some dragon anime girls and stuff.",
    "Might be fun.",
    "Yes, playing Tetris.",
    "They could practice without me.",
    "You guys already far ahead enough.",
    "You're actually not allowed to practice anymore.",
    "I've been saying Sarah likes, yeah, his name is not SER over buddy.",
    "Bay heads.",
    "So what I say I said Behance.",
    "OK, let's do a fluffy version.",
    "I'm not sure that will show about this guy.",
    "Sorry Sarah.",
    "And we want to teach me the tricks I know practicing as you know, know that you should coach.",
    "You should coach Arm Pal.",
    "She really needs it.",
    "I still floof.",
    "I need some reference.",
    "I want if I have any.",
    "This is my this bull, it's really good I reckon.",
    "I think people underestimate like when they drill like creatures that do these really plain faces, but you want to look for these expressions.",
    "That's what makes it interesting and this is what I use for that.",
    "The last Adobe live stream.",
    "No man look how expressive.",
    "Or like not really expressive.",
    "Maybe it is expressive, but sometimes you put human types of expressions on animals.",
    "Like this was not wink.",
    "Yeah this one.",
    "And so really winking.",
    "But it looks like something humans do.",
    "I don't know why he's here.",
    "I guess he's kind of emo.",
    "But yeah, they can get real expressive heart.",
    "Look at this.",
    "I used this one before for a dragon.",
    "I've also used.",
    "I've used this as well.",
    "I think I wanna do this one Monday.",
    "OK, but yeah this thought this tool fluffy one.",
    "We do like more, sort of.",
    "I need any reference for like a bear.",
    "Like that bird that looks like he's.",
    "Opinion of war.",
    "Which one?",
    "You mean even this one?",
    "Although this one yeah I want to use up something is all but.",
    "I don't know.",
    "I don't like the isis who played and I don't know why it gives you that feeling like it's like control motorized.",
    "Maybe it's just like bald as well.",
    "It's like lost her.",
    "Like I said before in streams.",
    "It's a little fun community.",
    "We can share your outlook.",
    "Get to know some other artists from around the world.",
    "We do challenges as well.",
    "In fact, about finishing up one of our challenges where we're doing a telephone game.",
    "And I can show you that's what we did before actually so my local files, so that's easy to access.",
    "But I can't click my.",
    "OK, I think my windows is dead.",
    "I thought it can click like my folder thing.",
    "Now here we go back.",
    "Let me grab that.",
    "Stuff.",
    "Mikes dropping?",
    "Up here we go challenge.",
    "Here we go.",
    "So.",
    "Last time you did the telephone game, basically what the telephone game game is we have.",
    "Someone who passes an artwork.",
    "Two and it goes in like sort of a chain right?",
    "So it started off with me.",
    "I had full groups of people that did that did this.",
    "This is the outlook that it started off with.",
    "And basically you pass it down to the next person.",
    "So example case parts for my art and did her version of the piece I did and then she passes on her artwork to the next person.",
    "And then that person only sees case be arts work and doesn't see mine.",
    "And does her interpretation of case, vearth, artwork and so on.",
    "So you end up with a variation of like an evolution of original artwork.",
    "I mean like you come back and look at the end and see how it changed rap.",
    "Very close to the reveal stage for the current challenge which is very exciting.",
    "So yeah, it's very fun.",
    "Last time this is the kind of stuff we do on on my discord.",
    "For anyone interested.",
    "I have a link in this stream description, I think.",
    "Yeah it's down there.",
    "Moscow, California hell yeah.",
    "I don't have anyone who's rushing in the discord, actually.",
    "I can't recall.",
    "Maybe there are and they're not active.",
    "For now I'm curious about my time zone.",
    "I'm in Sydney, 7:45 AM up nice and early for the stream.",
    "Main reason I'm up so early is 'cause I have better Internet during this time so.",
    "Otherwise, I probably stream at like lunchtime.",
    "If I could I would be ideal for me.",
    "OK, I'm going to do like a.",
    "'cause this side of the shield is sort of around here on this fear, and that area is a bit ambiguous.",
    "It's like between light and shadow is kind of Softap.",
    "So.",
    "I'm just going to add like a slight gradient on here, same as like the leg and foot here.",
    "And we pretty much very close to finishing off the lighting on this guy.",
    "Our initial lighting.",
    "Just a few more spots to keep consistent like this thing.",
    "Telegram is more popular.",
    "What's telegram?",
    "Tell me about it.",
    "Get some more juicy information of sharing a second after I.",
    "Finish up just a few more small areas of shadow.",
    "I think this would get some cost shadow from this shoulder pad eventually.",
    "Yeah, there we go.",
    "Alrighty, let's talk about edges, huh?",
    "Hard edges verse, soft edges.",
    "When should you transition from?",
    "When should like lighting transition and become soft edges instead of hard edges?",
    "I think.",
    "Like that should cover up.",
    "This is very important because this is telling us what is a car shadow, what is form Shadow and understanding.",
    "The difference is very useful in representing.",
    "Clear forms in your characters or whatever you're drawing.",
    "Actually, that's not bad.",
    "Actually offers people a few more spots too.",
    "To come rub.",
    "I missed the hand completely.",
    "And then I'll come back to that talk about hard versus soft edges.",
    "OK, so as I was saying.",
    "Oh yeah, what about will just go ahead?",
    "Hard versus soft edges.",
    "When should you use them?",
    "So let's use.",
    "This is the leg as an example.",
    "I think we have a great example around here.",
    "This like.",
    "We have a cloth that's costing Shadow on this leg.",
    "And we have areas of form right?",
    "The legs around.",
    "So.",
    "How do we represent that?",
    "This is a cast Shadow and this isn't a cast shadow.",
    "This is just a form that's turning away from the light source.",
    "So that's what the whenever.",
    "Something like that.",
    "You should definitely use a softap brush notice off brush off brush will work or smudging, and you only have like a blended edge.",
    "And this is the difference right when it's a blended edge that's telling us that this is a form that's turning away from Light, 'cause That's a slow transition.",
    "That's why I said nice zsoft edge on that.",
    "We can leave this as a hard edge because.",
    "There's no transition like that for car shadowcon shadow suggest areas that are blocked by another object.",
    "Blocking light.",
    "From having their light blocked by another object, so that's why it stays a hard edge so.",
    "And she turned your.",
    "If you turn your car shadows into soft edge.",
    "It doesn't really make sense, and then everything will look very blurry and.",
    "A bit ambiguous, so definitely keep those edges hard and I'm just going through a lot of edges in here and determining whether their soft and hard edges according to.",
    "Then being cast shadow or form shadow.",
    "He's a big form shadow here.",
    "Cloth is a good one for hard and soft edges.",
    "'cause it's only transitions in there.",
    "And you'll see that this will look quite different after I do this merging.",
    "Oh yeah, I think watercolors very hard to replicate for.",
    "Digital.",
    "Think traditional paintings.",
    "OK, in fact, I'll find out because I'm going to go painting for the first time this Friday.",
    "See how that goes.",
    "I'm very curious to see if I could like bringing my traditional painting skills into.",
    "Traditional.",
    "Could be very fun.",
    "Oh man, why is blue always looks so good?",
    "Off then that's it.",
    "That's an evil color right there.",
    "Probably good contrast 'cause it's like the highlight colors yellow.",
    "If I contrast that with like a purple, that's pretty good.",
    "Open we're going to be using.",
    "Hey, that's a question for future Jeff to handle.",
    "OK, I don't know I'm going to have it's going to be like instructed so I'll just use water.",
    "Using will probably most likely be.",
    "I don't do that.",
    "Oh, I meant taking my digital painting skills into traditional.",
    "See how that goes.",
    "Do I have those colors on anywhere else?",
    "I don't really have that kind of Purple E.",
    "Yeah, I don't.",
    "Or should I make it same color?",
    "Or should I make it contrast?",
    "What do you guys think?",
    "Might be too many colours if I make it contrast right?",
    "Like maybe you should stick more too.",
    "Towards what I have already.",
    "I'm a feeling I'll be using something quick that dries quickly what it is.",
    "It's like it's not acrylic.",
    "It's something else is in it.",
    "The paint.",
    "But you have a point about single.",
    "Like pink Yeah, I think if I if I bring into many contrasting ones will be too much.",
    "Especially if you look at what I have here.",
    "I didn't have like.",
    "I don't have to like, really.",
    "Loud colors on each one at visit.",
    "Many only one, so I think I'll just stick to 2 one here as well.",
    "Which I think is more catching.",
    "Gives more character.",
    "Yeah, my concern is it might bring too much for this character compared to the other ones.",
    "Since I am doing them as like a set.",
    "So if I don't have that type of treatment for these guys it might be too much for her.",
    "I think she probably lined them up as well.",
    "It Haha.",
    "A squish Thanks for joining.",
    "Because of having a pleasant day.",
    "Are you guys anyone doing anything on the weekends yet?",
    "Or you'll just staying home and staying safe still?",
    "I guess only kind of Australians and New Zealanders can really do much.",
    "At this point.",
    "You taught your stream, yay.",
    "What do you know me doing on?",
    "Sundays.",
    "How's things?",
    "Taking care of brothers.",
    "This thing home studying what not too hot.",
    "To go out, yeah, forgot super hot.",
    "I've been going out more these days.",
    "You guys know how things go.",
    "But I've been out.",
    "I went out shopping, went out to eat last night as well.",
    "And things feel like they're getting busier again.",
    "And I wonder how they will go.",
    "I think the difference now 'cause like the numbers feels similar to web covid started for like just started for Australia.",
    "But we're down to those numbers and I think the difference now is people feel less scared because we feel like it's more controlled back then.",
    "It's like we don't know how out of control was.",
    "We didn't know we didn't have much testing, so you don't know what the actual numbers are and that's what the fear.",
    "That's where the fear comes in.",
    "But now that it's like die down, we have more control of how many people actually have it.",
    "I guess that feels more safe.",
    "FedEx and it is the same as most days doing contain here.",
    "Forgot you guys aren't easing.",
    "Like Australia news.",
    "Yeah, that's why I haven't been on discord during weekends last week as well, I think is less active.",
    "The community is also know this code is awesome.",
    "Thanks man, appreciate it.",
    "I did want to create somewhere.",
    "The laws could gather and feel comfortable.",
    "And have people that can relate to.",
    "Yeah, I think yeah definitely.",
    "I felt like I've like.",
    "Other time person who flickers between.",
    "I'm like I think I'm on the edge between being extrovert and introvert.",
    "I'm definitely like I guess I'm like ambivert.",
    "And.",
    "I think like I recede into like my shell.",
    "If I don't do much for awhile in terms of like being social.",
    "And and like my extrovert slide.",
    "Oh no.",
    "Yeah, yeah, actually yeah, I think like I feel I got too comfortable just being like.",
    "Hell yeah OK we're getting there.",
    "And we could sort of still edit out light eye shadow color, which is really fun.",
    "Like a little bit more purple instead of blue 'cause I didn't want to make it slightly warmer.",
    "Think blue is a bit too cool.",
    "And we can always turn down the Opacity as well, so it's not so aggressive.",
    "I think I started off with a darker, darker value so I can build up from here.",
    "That was my initial plan.",
    "Grab that shadow color.",
    "Apply it to more areas, whoops, wrong mode.",
    "OK, one more area needed to change.",
    "Colours I think we need to sort of represent that this is a soft material here, so I just make that.",
    "Which I do.",
    "I think I should.",
    "Probably keep this upper arm light and turn these things.",
    "Dog.",
    "Alright, another ultimate question for you guys.",
    "Do you prefer painted artwork that painted Ross?",
    "Painterly look Or do you like line art?",
    "No judgment, but definitely adored.",
    "I question.",
    "That's better.",
    "Right, let's add some lighting as well.",
    "I prefer a rough painted stuff, I think, but it's painted wrong comparison.",
    "I love both bathrooms painted ones.",
    "Also put in a paint.",
    "Yeah, there's something feeling about the Painted Looker.",
    "And for anyone wondering what I'm doing right now, I'm using a colored Dodge mode.",
    "I've turned off some options in here, so these used to be ticked.",
    "I turn those off for my color Dodge and I'm just going with some lighting and defining some of these.",
    "Materials.",
    "So materials You could, like you know, slap on a texture.",
    "That's photo, but I really don't think she do that thing.",
    "Materials are represented by different value ranges.",
    "So that's what I'm doing right now, and everything that sort of.",
    "Using the same range of values, right?",
    "I had the flats and then I add a shadow on top, but we start introduce a different range for value range for certain material.",
    "You start to understand that it has different information from.",
    "Some of the other materials.",
    "And that's what's happening here.",
    "Very easy clap.",
    "What do you guys think?",
    "I mean, these guys are kind of chunky and transport like as well, so they're not.",
    "That bad, but I just like this shape of the head.",
    "And how has like a feel here is like kind of different kind of relates to the head shape of these guys as well.",
    "I might just roll with this.",
    "Actually get the.",
    "Maybe I could have like the small dude stand here and then like he like.",
    "It just has like a color on this guy that would be pretty cool.",
    "I think I might do that, 'cause then he's sitting on top of here, it's too distorted.",
    "You don't see much of his body.",
    "Now it's back.",
    "About 20 two people in here.",
    "I think that's the most I've had.",
    "Football has let me know where you guys are from.",
    "You know, if you have any questions about art.",
    "About me about Dragons or what I'm doing.",
    "Might do a little quick recap since we're at the one hour mark anyway.",
    "And since we need to adjust our camera, obviously.",
    "So yeah, looking on the authorization challenge right now.",
    "Creating 6 characters, one of which is a creature, which is what I'm working on now.",
    "They just had to have a characteristic which is some sort of.",
    "Looks like some sort of adjective.",
    "And yet so far I've got the leader here.",
    "Got out brave character here.",
    "And this is the creature, and I think the idea I want to do is to.",
    "Do you like a transportation team?",
    "Full like whatever is in this cube?",
    "This is like the.",
    "Is it kind of like the?",
    "What would you call it?",
    "I guess it's like, yeah, deterrent transport monster thing that carries it and these guys like protect it as well.",
    "Yeah.",
    "At some silhouette him.",
    "I will keep moving on.",
    "Aggro Duggar, he kind of looks like a dog as well, doesn't He?",
    "OK, finally done.",
    "Our creature.",
    "I took it off.",
    "Lot of planning and thinking so Adam II can finally replace him in the little line up that I have down here.",
    "See you later.",
    "Now we can check him in.",
    "It should be like that big.",
    "The bigger like that big.",
    "Oh yeah.",
    "Is the person I've seen you with glasses?",
    "The transition area, so I'm just going to pick.",
    "That a warmth.",
    "And that overlay.",
    "In some of these transition areas.",
    "That's going from light to shadow.",
    "I think that was a bit too red orangey.",
    "See how this looks.",
    "Yeah, might be better.",
    "I'm going to pick on those areas that a bit softer edged.",
    "Here.",
    "Can I have it?",
    "The more blood on this guys tones as well.",
    "That's something else does pretty well.",
    "OK, and I might also.",
    "Where is it?",
    "Or looks kinda cool when it's like.",
    "Doc metal Actually I do.",
    "I do wonder now.",
    "What happens if I like huge shift a little bit and look through?",
    "It's kind of cool.",
    "My dear is that.",
    "Will have similar materials by different color for each of these Warriors, so we definitely will run into some that have like detailing like this guy, but then it has like different color detailing instead.",
    "Green's kind of cool though.",
    "But we'll go with yellow.",
    "Was it I want to select these things and add lighting on that as well?",
    "A less aggressive light, maybe something.",
    "With lower opacity.",
    "I'll feel.",
    "Nice.",
    "And since I did everything like separate laid like this is so easy to select stuff right?",
    "Like if I wanted to select those markings again, you know I just hold CTRL, Press the layer and get all the selection for that if I want like the light toned arma I can select that.",
    "Phone select the Brown bits.",
    "Then I thought of here the whole silhouette and start he raising areas that I don't want selections off with arm by holding alt.",
    "And control.",
    "So now I can easily affect all the Brown areas.",
    "That's the power of setting things up nice and clean and right now that's relevant because I want to add a second very light.",
    "And secondary lights only appear in shadowed areas.",
    "So what that means is I can select my shadowed areas now.",
    "And adding a softap.",
    "The flight maybe with like a blue.",
    "Getting that secondary light.",
    "Easy see now just affecting.",
    "Wait, not that do work, I didn't.",
    "Using the selection.",
    "There we go.",
    "Now I can just affect all the areas of shadow.",
    "With my secondary light and secondary lighter mainly thinking about it coming from the top down.",
    "So any services that are facing upwards.",
    "And apply that.",
    "And this is how we show some more format information in those shadowed areas.",
    "Public misconception for students maybe?",
    "About getting hired.",
    "And.",
    "Their hopes for what kind of quality they put in their portfolio.",
    "This is.",
    "Weird idea that.",
    "You know, maybe they'll see your work.",
    "And see that potential.",
    "I think it's all about that.",
    "The feeling that maybe they can in turn and teach you.",
    "But being a very competitive industry.",
    "It's very unlikely that ever happens unless you have connections.",
    "And then if you have connections, it's like while they use their money to teach you when there's people out there that already can do the work.",
    "Why hire junior when there's so many mid level people out there?",
    "So I guess what I'm trying to say is.",
    "Put in the time.",
    "In practice, get good at your craft and don't hope for.",
    "A person to see your potential by instead.",
    "Trust only yourself to improve and get better.",
    "So that you don't have to rely on someone else.",
    "Because you can control how you use your time.",
    "But you can't control how.",
    "Lockwood work in this, getting the right person to.",
    "Maybe you think that you have potential.",
    "To us, even like.",
    "A friend helping you out, it's like.",
    "Say I ran a studio and someone asked me like Hey can I help you out?",
    "It's like even if you wanted to help out, what can they really do if they aren't level isn't there then?",
    "It's really hard to assign any work to them.",
    "I sort of.",
    "I've had that happen.",
    "Just doesn't workout.",
    "Right and see how braided hair works.",
    "Here we go.",
    "Honest reason different from any other industry in many regards.",
    "You can draw lots of.",
    "Analogies between this and other industries?",
    "Yeah, I guess so.",
    "Very true.",
    "Oh yeah, are there any industries that just like higher from potential?",
    "I think that happens anymore, huh?",
    "Like just cassone shows drive doesn't mean that that's not really enough.",
    "Trying to figure out how grades work.",
    "I'm looking like, whoa.",
    "OK, so one goes in the other one does a thing and then.",
    "But Cousin this this one comes back.",
    "OK OK, OK, there we go.",
    "This is something happen.",
    "Is the tricky thing.",
    "Do you like it?",
    "Yeah, I would sometimes I think when I feel kind of sleepy, I'd wear it.",
    "With my eyes a bit too strained.",
    "Also wearing.",
    "Another fact like.",
    "Uh-huh squish, saying that it does help.",
    "I'm not really sure if it does, but I feel like.",
    "It helps with my eye strain a little bit.",
    "And I see a headaches as well.",
    "When I used to use the computer for too much and wearing this has helped me a lot.",
    "You are classes.",
    "Oh yeah, you wear glasses, that's right.",
    "Ain't nothing wrong with a bit of a nerd book.",
    "Some people like that.",
    "OK, that's added to our lineup.",
    "Get rid of some of the lines here.",
    "Why were those lines OK?",
    "Yeah, we don't need these lines.",
    "Nice is Postal schools are not too.",
    "Yeah, I think I need some that kind of face this way.",
    "Now to the last slide.",
    "Yeah doggy, how you doing buddy?",
    "It's like the good old times, right?",
    "Those epic cool and nice enforcing a lot of adjectives in there man, would you try to compensate for something?",
    "Alright, let's do creatures.",
    "Like Controller The joyful guy.",
    "I don't want to do this.",
    "I wanted to have like some sort of leash.",
    "Hum.",
    "Is look through some reference.",
    "Have a think about this one.",
    "This was the trickiest one.",
    "I had trouble with this before.",
    "I've actually done a very similar project for a personal thing, and I'm sort of doing another spin on it right now for this art station challenge.",
    "But last time I'll show you guys where I got the last time.",
    "Primal Tech champions.",
    "These were two of them so far.",
    "I'm not going to use the same thing, but I'll have like similar ideas.",
    "See.",
    "So this is the thumbnail.",
    "Some before and other thing this guy did too well.",
    "It's kind of cool.",
    "I like it.",
    "But not sold.",
    "And I was working on this character, but never never really finished.",
    "I should really finish her off 'cause she's almost there.",
    "This is kinda cool actually.",
    "Yeah, I kind of like this guy.",
    "Is how his hands are in.",
    "He is I control this animal.",
    "I'll just do like a literal Leach.",
    "Leash for this one.",
    "The truth can only be expressed with all those three words together.",
    "Yeah, I guess I guess I menu.",
    "If it is, that's that's what works for you, then, Uh, Yeah.",
    "I can close my animal rough board now.",
    "Yeah, I need to make him feel joyful.",
    "So what I'm thinking about is the pose at the moment I developing parable tech champions thing on the side for now once you go with them.",
    "Yeah, it was like a side project for Maine I wanted.",
    "It's kind of like portfolio stuff.",
    "I guess I wanted to show I could create.",
    "A world with a pretty clear aesthetic that wasn't.",
    "Doesn't look like it belongs to anything else so far.",
    "That's basically the goal.",
    "And.",
    "That was something I started, I think.",
    "Two years ago now end of 2018.",
    "I think it was when I started.",
    "I've only done 2 characters in like 1 sort of splash style illustration.",
    "Let's just try some poses.",
    "Well, sis are the box design OK?",
    "Little sis, this is nothing.",
    "Yeah, I think it's good to have projects like that on the slide, it's.",
    "It's good for you to always have something to work on.",
    "And developing something is always.",
    "Very fun as well.",
    "This thing is like a joyful pose.",
    "I don't really have any ideas yet though.",
    "And look at some reference.",
    "Or maybe I can relate.",
    "This guy to this with something that's the same.",
    "That's not only the lesion in the mouth, I think.",
    "Maybe some sort of heavy equipment that matches this so you can tell there's some sort of link between them and then somehow communicating.",
    "And the dudes I controlling this guy.",
    "I think that might be good.",
    "I finished with them.",
    "I'm not really finished, so I want to do at least a set of four or five, and I've only done too, so yeah.",
    "Then it out.",
    "Pretty cool.",
    "It's just a lot of other things I've got in the way.",
    "I just haven't gotten around to it, but if I ever have extra time I think I'd be working on that.",
    "So joyful really need to show the face.",
    "I went at any mosque or anything on here but maybe I should do something more for helmet.",
    "Maybe should be up here.",
    "I can think of more joyful and like excited.",
    "Sort of poses from up here.",
    "But that is thought too much of the design though.",
    "I think that's OK, right?",
    "Like that's not covering too much.",
    "What do you guys think?",
    "Will be pretty small up here, but I wanted him to be a smaller looking character so we get more variation in body sizes.",
    "I think that's OK.",
    "Those are initial plan.",
    "It's like kind of cool.",
    "If he holds the horns like this.",
    "It's like they have some sort of synergy.",
    "Hey miss tell me more about the project you're working on actually.",
    "Don't know too much about it.",
    "Awesome words I gave for joyful short gun tech damn.",
    "Hum.",
    "That's actually hard to work with.",
    "Yeah, you have like this.",
    "Is it full like your game or something?",
    "Triangles, maybe I'll make this guy and I need to decide in shape as well.",
    "Let's look if I've been waiting to do this for like awhile 'cause the Workflow I had with line work didn't really allow it.",
    "So I wanted to bring this leg out.",
    "And I want to, I think.",
    "Like laying the body more forward slightly.",
    "Kay?",
    "I have references for how I wanted to do parenting on the cloth as well, so we might look into that right now.",
    "I want to get old that up to like proper detail before I go into.",
    "More rendering was my reference board.",
    "Hum.",
    "Primal Tech There it is.",
    "I hope me loading things they didn't like.",
    "Like the stream alot.",
    "Probably did the.",
    "OK, I'm done with the screen.",
    "Another screen.",
    "So flight.",
    "Hard light.",
    "Do not like.",
    "Do some padding on here.",
    "Let's see.",
    "How do we sign up for houses on discord?",
    "I can't write anything on the House.",
    "Sign up.",
    "Yeah, you have to get so there's a challenge board.",
    "You have to do one of those challenges.",
    "First will assign you.",
    "A Chunky Warrior Walt role, so that's for basically all the sort of challenge events in the future.",
    "And then, if that's like the house parts optional.",
    "So once you get the Chunky Warrior Roll, you can.",
    "Sign up for house.",
    "Let's have a look on there.",
    "Yeah, you know what?",
    "Let me guide you through this place.",
    "So if you go up to here, just take on one of these challenges, yeah?",
    "And then you submit it to chunky Gallery.",
    "You see other people.",
    "Actually this is all like our recent challenge, but here's one.",
    "He's one of the submissions from the Chunky Challenge Board.",
    "Once you get that, then you can go into house, sign up and get a house.",
    "Could Steve join discord?",
    "Looking forward to speaking to you there.",
    "No problem.",
    "Actually hate doing cloth patterns, by the way.",
    "2nd is the most annoying things for me.",
    "Much is like I really feel like just taking some pattern off.",
    "You're just sitting there practicing.",
    "If you try to contact.",
    "Unless, like you know it's about skill, right?",
    "Like I'm assuming that you're asking because.",
    "You're starting out, so that means your skill levels low.",
    "So if your skill levels low, why would they hire you as a freelancer?",
    "So.",
    "Saying that is yeah, I'm assuming that your options are zero for freelance work.",
    "I'd only jump through freelance work when I have options available to me and options like clients come to be asking for.",
    "For stuff to be done.",
    "It's very hot and like I still have to struggle like when I apply for stuff nothing comes.",
    "But I'm just like submitting my own stuff on authorization and putting myself out there as my own brand and style that things come to me, so I think I'm assuming that's how it is for everyone.",
    "Like unless you're super super skilled.",
    "If you apply for stuff, it's very hard 'cause you're competing with everyone.",
    "There's nothing unique about you, you're just another application.",
    "But by making yourself stand out on that station, putting your unique style out there, and they find you.",
    "It's much easier to get a job that way.",
    "So anyway, freelances viable at the beginning, as if yet you're from the beginning, like you're just a guy who's like.",
    "Yeah, I'm good at concept art an illustration, but I don't want to answer job, but maybe I want it now and you like you like super super good at that stuff.",
    "Then yeah, freelances viable from the beginning.",
    "But yeah, without like any experience this it's very, very difficult to freelance with.",
    "Without the skills.",
    "I think like freelance is an option, you unlock very, very late.",
    "In your career.",
    "All not very very late, but like later in your career.",
    "And I definitely want to create create that impression that like freelance is super super good.",
    "It's epic and awesome.",
    "Everyone should do it.",
    "Because it's definitely not.",
    "Something that everyone can just pick up straight away.",
    "I don't want to put people in like a tough financial situation where they go into freelancing expecting to earn money and they don't.",
    "Did you just assume you're No, I didn't try to fill out from beginning.",
    "My goal was to learn.",
    "My goal was to improve and get a studio job first.",
    "That was my first priority.",
    "I kind of prefer him with like the Bandana Steel.",
    "Sorry man, I don't like your mouth.",
    "Uhm, OK.",
    "Yeah, again, the way I feel about this is this thumbnail is.",
    "I feel like I've lost the essence of Pike in this version.",
    "How do you guys feel like I feel like?",
    "This is more potential.",
    "And is kind of like a doc.",
    "Dragon Hunter.",
    "This is sort of in between has not dragon.",
    "Dragon Hunter armor, but like little bit of Pike.",
    "This is leaning more towards ninja, I feel.",
    "Maybe I should work on that a bit more and this is more demon ish.",
    "Yeah, I think I think we can hide this one.",
    "Put this further down.",
    "I wonder if silhouette wise this one works.",
    "I don't feel like this one works silhouette wise either.",
    "Let's dwagon him up.",
    "What if he has like downwards hanging hornshuh?",
    "We haven't done that yet.",
    "And yeah, I'm sorry, but like the Internet how it's hard to have a conversation 'cause like.",
    "The Internet and choking on here.",
    "But discoverable wasn't active OK.",
    "Or maybe you want to be active suddenly.",
    "Finally decided to do something.",
    "OK, that's good.",
    "What kind of what do you do?",
    "Do you like fantasy stuff?",
    "Not liking any of these patterns I'm making you look at that reference.",
    "Both.",
    "Very cool.",
    "What would you say influences style like it says that in game that you play that you like?",
    "Damn I'm going to make up for this game.",
    "Sci-fi and fantasy hell yeah.",
    "That's me too man.",
    "Yeah, this pattern name working.",
    "League of Legends.",
    "My favor.",
    "I don't really play, seems me.",
    "She's a art is just so good, right?",
    "But?",

    "Why you popping off like you didn't do anything?",
    "I feel so good when like.",
    "If they teabag and then I get to kill off the Woods, I think that's the best feeling.",

    "All you gotta do is teabag back.",
    "I.",
    "The thing I would, but I'm afraid of getting like tea bags and then getting bodied.",
    "So what I do is I make sure like 100% going to win.",
    "Or like there like falling off the stage and that's what I want to go ahead with that teabag.",
    "I'm like like flicking that stick hard man.",
