    "Sort of thing going on.",
    "I should also point out that like I'm doing this from memory, I don't have any reference images, so the characters don't always look exactly like they did, they more just have like iconic features like this dude lack of teeth.",

    "All that good stuff.",
    "Leave pleasure to have you here.",
    "Hope you're enjoying it so far.",
    "I feel like since you popped in and said you're new to the stream, I've done nothing but talking and not draw.",
    "So again, this stream is 60 minutes, so we're really not out is wearing it out.",
    "I do take the drawing, so if I don't finish them in time and Polish him up and then they get posted on my bed.",
    "They get posted on my Instagram page first.",
    "Will make their way into a Behance Gallery and then every Friday at New Year history and it's not really a live stream.",
    "It's more of like a prerecorded kind of deal, but I posted.",
    "I think it will say Live 'cause I feeds live, but it's a time lapse and I edit it and I put together all the drawings that I made throughout the week into a nice little time lapse and I stream real quick.",
    "They take their like under 5 minutes and I pump him through.",
    "Into the hands so you all can see the tuning you can catch it as it's happening.",
    "Oh, it's all good.",
    "Yeah, quite chatty.",
    "I know I like to talk a lot.",
    "Is that like you telling me to like shut up?",
    "That's totally cool if it is.",
    "And, uh.",
    "What is the time out live stream?",
    "So yeah, timelapses wash.",
    "Them all happened really quick.",
    "That has no talking, it's just music.",
    "Hi.",
    "We're going to pick the basic ground.",
    "I move my pallet over so I forgot what I said.",
    "It's moving up to.",
    "And we are gonna try to handle.",
    "So.",
    "All using the basic round brush, I want to suck that will hire.",
    "I think.",
    "I think this is like 12.",
    "And it just kind of following my rough sketch.",
    "Detail stuff like that gets added and obviously later.",
    "Here.",
    "So one thing I like to do alot again using Adobe fresco on an iPad.",
    "The 6th Gen 9.7 inch.",
    "Usually work on multiple layers, so I can kind of just erase and get those really clean lines.",
    "No, like, no like keep being chatty or like no stop talking.",
    "I think you meant like no keep talking.",
    "I hope you enjoy my banter.",
    "Chattaway teacher to work from home.",
    "How do you turn the pencil into an eraser without going to the icon?",
    "Awesome question.",
    "OK, so.",
    "I want to hear more about how you teach 'cause I was thinking the same regardless.",
    "1st, I'll teach you.",
    "Here's what I do.",
    "Got your pencil right.",
    "You got your brush picked so I'm using the basic round vector brush.",
    "You draw your line and you're like I don't want that line there.",
    "I want to erase but you don't want to go back over.",
    "Tap this icon wherever you know it's really annoying.",
    "What you can do is see this little toggle switch right here that I'm kind of moving around.",
    "The screen that takes whatever.",
    "That takes whatever you're using, like whatever tool and converts it into an eraser so you can use that brush to erase it.",
    "Oh, wait loops.",
    "Well, let me have the get the brush like this.",
    "All the eraser selected.",
    "Takes whatever you're using and turns into a racer.",
    "Now it's really nice about this.",
    "Is that it also read the pressure sensitivity so you get an eraser with pressure sensitivity.",
    "So like if I were to go in here, start real thin, add a little more pressure, create a thicker eraser.",
    "I really like it.",
    "So the way that I use this, I usually use it as an array as like a main eraser.",
    "You know, like and I keep my racer set to something really big.",
    "120 right now so that I have like a large eraser so I don't have to apply a lot of pressure on the screen, so I just have an eraser option to click if I need something bigger or I can use the brush with the pressure sensitivity.",
    "There's a bunch of new ones popping up right now, so I'd love to hear what everyone's everyone checking out.",
    "Let's see.",
    "There we go.",
    "Yeah, Post that discord now.",
    "I'll definitely take a look at it.",
    "Sorry in the comments.",
    "Alright, let's see.",
    "15 minutes.",
    "Anything?",
    "If anyone tuned in after I started and didn't hear my whole spiel, all good.",
    "You can go back watch it on the replay 'cause I don't want to repeat it 'cause they can get annoying for some people.",
    "But I do want to point out some key things.",
    "If you look below in the description, I have a lot of new links there that I usually don't post beforehand.",
    "There's a discord.",
    "Please join it.",
    "We can talk shop.",
    "And then there's also links to Facebook and Instagram or no.",
    "No Facebook was saying Instagram.",
    "I have a Facebook, I never use it.",
    "Yeah, the Adobe live groups are really good.",
    "They do some cool stuff on those.",
    "Oops, forgot the time was not merge down.",
    "Let's make that a little bigger.",
    "Yeah, we'll bring him in.",
    "This does not look like the guy at all, but that's OK.",
    "I did see a really funny meme about social distancing.",
    "By the way, I want to put this out there and it showed that guys face in his mouth and it was like here to here not appropriate.",
    "But here to here.",
    "Is appropriate, so getting the lesson on that.",
    "There you go.",
    "Jack, do you have a favorite streamer that you that you tune into?",
    "It does not have to be me.",
    "I'm not looking for praise here, I'm really that's legitimate question.",
    "I'd love to know who you're watching and who you really like.",
    "'cause I'm always looking for new tips and tricks.",
    "Alright, let's grab the color so icy out these colors.",
    "I did this on Monday, where I showed that I used the.",
    "I use a CC library, have a Gallery called colors rule and then I save the color.",
    "The color from the previous illustration, so I keep them consistent right into here.",
    "Thanks man, appreciate you.",
    "TuneIn.",
    "Alright, so let's see.",
    "So I'm going to use the vector brush basic round.",
    "It's the basic round brush and then I set the pressure dynamic and the velocity dynamic on so those are those checkbox there.",
    "This was asked last week or notice that whenever I turn off one of them, I turn off both and whenever I turn on when I turn on both, that's because I really like to be able to have that paper future with with the pressure dynamics in the velocity dynamics.",
    "If I'm going to shut one of them off, I'm probably trying to get a brush stroke that's going to be very consistent across the board, so I'll shut them off to make sure that the width never changes.",
    "And we're going to start the mouth.",
    "This is feeling good 'cause this is feeling a little bit more original out my smoothing.",
    "I set it up I people always talk about my smooth lines and I gotta tell you guys, the software does all the work.",
    "Like I say that every week.",
    "Um?",
    "Right, so there we go.",
    "And let's see.",
    "Start putting these weird choppers.",
    "I heard that the dude got new teeth during the documentary, but they only used.",
    "I don't know how true this is.",
    "They only used his interviews of him with the bad teeth because that's what they had most of.",
    "I guess you gotta like towards the end of production and he was like not happy that they didn't show anything with him with like his new choppers in.",
    "So I know last time you said your style sessions patient came from 90s Nick Toons.",
    "You got any good books or reference stuff for that?",
    "That's a good question.",
    "do I have any good books or reference stuff for like 90s Nick Toons?",
    "Not really.",
    "But if you hop in like I said, if you join that discord, I do have an inspiration section where I post a lot of stuff.",
    "It's really good question.",
    "I could dig up some stuff and post it there for you.",
    "Z.",
    "Victoria is really good Jack not to break my turn.",
    "I thought she's awesome.",
    "Anywho, Yeah, Josh will go back to your question about the nicktoons stuff.",
    "I don't have any real references for it.",
    "I don't know.",
    "I mean, I can offer up references for like Instagram accounts and things like that that I follow that.",
    "Another really cool tip if you want to get rid of this whole thing really fast, grab the paint bucket, get that little toggle you all the moving around like I do.",
    "I just been doing that so I'll see what I'm doing at the little toggle and then you literally just tap on the line.",
    "Boom goes away.",
    "I'm seeing a Mickey Zombie hand.",
    "Yeah, it's definitely a Mickey Zombie and my hands are definitely like the old like Disney hands minus the glove, you know, but I really like him.",
    "I don't know why drawn that way.",
    "I think it's just because I feel like they have a lot of expression behind them.",
    "And they're relatively simple.",
    "To do and kind of quick.",
    "So we were kind of what kind of teacher are you?",
    "Do you teach like elementary school?",
    "Are you like a college professor?",
    "And how you handle in the whole stay at home thing.",
    "It's pretty crazy for teachers right now.",
    "I feel so props to you, by the way, 'cause I can only imagine like if you're handing out assignments and working with students, I feel like no one's reading anything right now.",
    "Let me know if I'm right.",
    "Good.",
    "Miss Sloane, you're passing my line work and sometimes it gets in the way a little bit like this weird pinky that I doodled.",
    "Looks awful so we're going to do that.",
    "I was saying this actually in my stream Saturday night.",
    "I don't know why, but I really struggle with babies.",
    "They always end up looking like thumbs to Maine or like just another odd finger that was a little bit better than ever.",
    "Just they never quite look like.",
    "Oh, professor.",
    "Welcome to the.",
    "Welcome to the welcome to the chat Pasco replace Adobe draw so you can still use Adobe draw.",
    "I think you can at least Adobe draw for me with one of my favorite apps for the longest time until fresco came along.",
    "I don't know if it's actually replace it.",
    "I think you can still use draw it still a viable.",
    "That's out there, but I do know that anything you make and draw or in Photoshop sketch now through creative cloud gets ported into fresco.",
    "I have a feeling that maybe Adobe is going to phase those out overtime 'cause they basically taken 2 apps and put them in one.",
    "Don't quote me on that.",
    "I I'm speculating, but I wouldn't be surprised if that's what happens.",
    "Fresco to Maine really isn't lacking anything that the other ones have.",
    "The only thing it does lack for sure.",
    "Is a shape tool so they added this ruler in here so you can make nice lines but they still are lacking the like circles and those kind of like abstract shapes that were in draw and I think also in sketch.",
    "They just don't have him here.",
    "I don't know why that is.",
    "I really hope that they bring them in together.",
    "Who are right?",
    "Yeah, yeah that you know what pro creates a cool app.",
    "It's got a lot of functionality.",
    "People ask me regularly.",
    "Why do I prefer fresco over procreate and the reasons reasons really simple.",
    "Actually, I really like the flexibility of fresco because to my knowledge I haven't opened propane along time, so this may have changed by now.",
    "So correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think procreate supports vector lines still.",
    "and I like vectors.",
    "Fresco does, so I like being able to have.",
    "The use of vectors and I like being able to sync everything with creative cloud and pump it into like illustrator or Photoshop or after effects to animate.",
    "What about vectors?",
    "Yes, so I'm using a vector brush right now.",
    "Like if I grab this hand.",
    "Right, and I like scale up like this.",
    "Is this is a vector through and through we can scale forever.",
    "That's so the three brushes in fresco.",
    "Can you open pixel brush?",
    "Which is what I use for my pencil in my rough sketches and it's just like a basic pencil I used to do that for my rough sketches 'cause it feels more natural and that's just your standard pencil, but there's a ton of other fun little options in here.",
    "You can import brushes to get import Kyle brushes, that kind of stuff like like like different markers.",
    "And things of that nature.",
    "So the pixel brushes are really nice there, just like Photoshop.",
    "Brushes matter.",
    "Fact they are Photoshop brushes and you can insert all sorts of fun stuff like I have this fun halftone one.",
    "You know that I found stuff like that.",
    "Then the other brush is called a live brush.",
    "That I pull some inspiration from.",
    "But I don't have any like books or anything that I regularly read.",
    "Or like art books, if you will, that kind of showcase that stuff you know growing up like an even still today.",
    "Like a lot of art books like those like coffee table kind of books.",
    "That I used to really enjoy where the graffiti ones.",
    "I don't know if that helps you out at all with your question, but I used to use a lot of those for reference.",
    "'cause graffiti art is something that's always really fascinated me for a number of reasons.",
    "One, the colors in the characters always super fun.",
    "Also too, like I just feel like I'd never be that good.",
    "So I was like exploring that kind of stuff, so it's always been a really good resource and I find a lot of like the same things that I like those kind of tones resonate in that culture as well, so it would be a good place to start.",
    "Alright, let's clean up the slip.",
    "Yeah, I feel like a lot of people that TuneIn Joshua myself are usually fans of.",
    "We're all end up being fans of the same things this tongue is looking weird, but I love it.",
    "Thinking this bottom part up a little bit.",
    "There we go.",
    "Class.",
    "Always turned down.",
    "By the way, my rough sketch 'cause sometimes I find a little distracting and when I do that kind of this kind of reminds me of like transfer paper.",
    "Or Belham That's I meant to say when you put like Valium over top of an illustration.",
    "Like this?",
    "Who the top part looks little weird?",
    "Screw that out.",
    "There it is.",
    "It's got popcorn kernel, or like a butt cheek.",
    "I'm going to start looking for some references for, like that kind of cartoon area 'cause I'm sure there's tons of art books out there like I'm trying to see if I have any art books like in my vicinity that I use, but I don't that are like within reaching distance from my computer.",
    "I will say that on the shelf over here there's a plethora of comic books and graphic novels, so if anyone's curious.",
    "Virgin.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Yeah it is a very like Gene Simmons kind of tongue.",
    "Alright, let's see here.",
    "So let's put in.",
    "And let's.",
    "Just add in some like obviously these things would be recessed a little bit so we gotta add a little bit of.",
    "That idea that you know these little like overshoots that kind of help.",
    "Expressed that looks like it's kind of falling out.",
    "I actually really like how they kind of round up and go in, so I might.",
    "Might try to redo this 2 three here.",
    "In this gum line that I added.",
    "There we go.",
    "It's weird actually.",
    "Now this side the line is kind of little bulging, funky I'm not going to worry about it too much 'cause I'm going to fill that part in with black.",
    "And you're not going to really notice.",
    "So that's called cutting corners.",
    "So what alive brush does is an act like I only have watercolor oil.",
    "I think you can maybe add some where they're going to add new ones.",
    "There's a whole bunch of options, but they act like real brushes.",
    "So like you have your oil there, you know.",
    "But they do interact with each other.",
    "So like the watercolor is probably the best one.",
    "Like if I were to go along and then it bleeds out and it also bleeds with whatever images are underneath it on the pixel layer, which is really cool.",
    "Hum.",
    "You know it's a fun way.",
    "I see a lot of cool artists make some really nice things using using the watercolor brushes here in Frisco, so there's a lot of fun stuff you can do with that.",
    "And then there's the vector brush, which is my favorite.",
    "So one of the things I should know about this, by the way, if you're on a pixel layer, so if you look over that way that way.",
    "That way you look over that way.",
    "Sorry, my camera reverse if you look over that way, you'll notice that all my layers might be able to see some layers like this layer here has like a big solid circle.",
    "Other layers have, like this little kind of pixelated circle that indicates whether it's a vector or a.",
    "Or a pixel.",
    "So something that's really cool if you're on a pixel and you have your vector brush and you start to draw, it will try not to do it right now because I have vector layers, so it's trying to tell me like hey, you gotta pull on these machines like enforce it.",
    "Now it's just gonna be mad into the vector lyrics already having if you don't have a vector layer made yet.",
    "I don't want to blow away the work I've already done, but if you don't have a vector layer made yet on the pencil layer and you try to draw with the vector brush will create a new layer and then indicate it so that you know you don't have to less work for you have to keep making new layers.",
    "Let's see, I'm using computer draw and can do my cards and sketches from my web design.",
    "Now I see what you're saying, OK?",
    "Fresco might not be the best app for what you're trying to do, however I'm sorry.",
    "How do you say your name Luke?",
    "Is that it?",
    "Let me know if I said that right?",
    "If not, maybe type in how you fanatically say it.",
    "You also got a really last name.",
    "But At Max last year, Adobe previewed illustrator for the iPad and it looked like it was tailored towards making like logos and that kind of stuff.",
    "So maybe just gotta wait.",
    "Usually they announced that kind of stuff in the fault at Max and then it comes out the next year year later at the following Max.",
    "So just keep your head in the ground then.",
    "I'm sure it's comment, you know.",
    "It seems like adobes pushing real hard to get everybody gone and working on iPads, hence why they were these photo shop which was OK.",
    "I think people hate it on in a lot worse than it really was.",
    "All right, so we're going like Mickey Zombie hand like we're talking about.",
    "We're going to add some like fun, like tattered, torn off areas, I guess.",
    "And I feel like this should be like a little hand wrinkle over here somewhere.",
    "Or At.",
    "So.",
    "Another question for the group.",
    "For those of you stuck at home.",
    "Anyone played any good video games?",
    "I.",
    "Like Games a lot, I kind of slowed down on playing him 'cause I'm going to adult and I don't know.",
    "It's not really good reason I have responsibility, but now that I found more time at home, I've been playing a lot more, which is been really nice 'cause I've been able to play a lot with my friends and I think we all were really busy with life prior to this whole virus thing.",
    "And now we can all hang out more and catching up and I'm really enjoying it a lot.",
    "So I'm always looking for new games, the ones that I'm currently playing I'm playing Call of Duty war zone and I'm playing freedom finger.",
    "Yes freedom finger, awesome game, check it out and made by a couple of cool artists is a good Music in South rocks in it?",
    "That kind of stuff.",
    "And let me know what your plan.",
    "If you play games.",
    "All right, so we're drawn in the hand part like the bottom part now.",
    "I'm going to put some more tattered up nasty's down there, but I think it would make it like a background kind of either.",
    "Maybe their maternal my pressure sensitivity and my velocity dynamics?",
    "Let's see if I can close this up.",
    "And cutting corners is OK.",
    "In my opinion.",
    "If you can hide it.",
    "Right there we go.",
    "We got her gums.",
    "We can.",
    "Well.",
    "So not quite a few people watching right now.",
    "Just out of Curiosity, is anyone new to my stream?",
    "Does anyone have any questions so far pop in the chat?",
    "Ask where friendly community there's a couple regulars here.",
    "I think that would be more than happy to give you the warm welcome.",
    "Let us know.",
    "I just realized how fun these teeth are going to be to like shade.",
    "I can't wait to get time.",
    "Alright, so let's merge all these layers together.",
    "Let's just get this mouth on one layer.",
    "And we're going to fill in the center.",
    "Alright, let's add some.",
    "That's lips to it.",
    "So I'm drawing with a vector brush.",
    "If anyone is curious, I just use the basic round with a taper setting.",
    "I do sometimes use the basic paper, but I never really touched these other guys like they're pretty fun brushes, but I never use them.",
    "The real reason why I think it just.",
    "Don't know.",
    "I just I really like the basic round it's.",
    "It's like it's just such a tried and true.",
    "What's everyone's favorite beer for drinking?",
    "And Joshua, would you grab you were talking about grabbing a beer out of the fridge?",
    "Did you grab one?",
    "I don't know if I saw what it was.",
    "But I'd love to hear also going to clean up this line 'cause this looks like a mistake.",
    "Now boy trying to raise something emerged be tricky.",
    "There we go.",
    "And.",
    "I know that's the best part, right?",
    "I mean, his front teeth were barely hanging in there, so how we, just, you know?",
    "I think we're cartooning.",
    "That's one of the one of the key things I never really talk about.",
    "This kind of stuff, and I really should talk about it more.",
    "Part of the funding cartooning is finding those little details and exaggerating them.",
    "You know he had not a lot of teeth.",
    "Well, those teeth presumably are going to be hanging in there that well, so making falling out.",
    "I think I mentioned this lot on my last stream, but I'd really awesome opportunity along time ago to take some classes at the Center for cartoon study in White River Junction, Vt and.",
    "While I was there was like a summer class course.",
    "One of the teachers said that cartooning is taking really complex objects and making them look really simple.",
    "So you know the same thing like these are just two blobby kinda like popcorn chunks and just put him at that right angle, making it look like they're going to dangle in.",
    "Fallout makes it really kind of pop and make something that could be really complex really simple.",
    "Oh, you have the shock top, that's right.",
    "Ooh, Captain Morgan of Vanilla Pepsi.",
    "That sounds really good.",
    "What's my favorite guitar that is true?",
    "So what's your favorite guitar mouth?",
    "Yes.",
    "Actually play guitar.",
    "I haven't picked mine up though in a long time.",
    "Does anyone else playing instrument more in the chat that be fun?",
    "Where is musically talented?",
    "Right, so just doing this.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Power of adding a little bit of.",
    "Talk about this actually quite a bit of ice trays.",
    "I feel like with illustration work for a lot of times.",
    "I think with illustration work a lot of time, especially for people who are starting out there.",
    "We feel like they need to add a lot of detail to make something a little bit more interesting, and sometimes you don't really need to do that.",
    "Sometimes the solution is a lot simpler and all you gotta do is just add, add some.",
    "Just add some black or like whatever color your line work is like.",
    "Just fill it in and you might find that it's going to help you relational out before you start going crazy and and doing a bunch of like crazy stuff.",
    "We just don't need to do to make it more interesting.",
    "Now obviously I only had a little bit down here, but to give you a prime example of what I'm talking about, when I was in college at a teacher that always have a straw, these like really crazy splash pages.",
    "It was just kind of like a train of thought.",
    "And when when you would do that?",
    "Then you would take a little piece of paper, cut square in it, put it on top of this complex image, and find a really basic area, and then find a way to fill in part of it black and you make another interesting image.",
    "It was really fascinating.",
    "Little was a fun kind of module.",
    "A string line somewhere.",
    "I'll boy.",
    "How far back do I need to go?",
    "It was a fun exercise.",
    "OK, I went way far back.",
    "OK, let's let's redo part of this.",
    "Let's merge these guys down anyway.",
    "A lot.",
    "I see I only like games kid.",
    "64 so fast, so stressed.",
    "I actually have one of the PlayStation classics here in little studio space, and it's also left.",
    "I don't plan enough actually to be honest with you, but it's it's pretty cool.",
    "I do like the old school games.",
    "25 and 64?",
    "Definitely, that's.",
    "I do like I do like the new console games are a lot like I play PlayStation outside of it.",
    "Who's your favorite N64 game?",
    "I was like my load bowling a lot.",
    "I feel like everyone is going to say goldeneye.",
    "There's a lot of games crash bandicoot, knowing that crash bandicoot PlayStation Wanna Sing Banjo Kazooie there we go.",
    "I had a good one earlier and now I don't like what I'm making.",
    "Alright, so let's add in this little guy here.",
    "And you know whatever that is.",
    "Also, going to the bone.",
    "So the bone is just a big kind of circular thing.",
    "Hello.",
    "So.",
    "Shut up.",
    "Can Layer.",
    "There we go.",
    "Now we got ourselves a vector hand.",
    "So vector Zombie.",
    "Mickey Mouse, whatever hand wanna call it.",
    "Oh my God, Zelda was a great game.",
    "I wonder what my reaction just looked like everybody whenever that sell.",
    "That was fun.",
    "Alright so we got our hand.",
    "And this is looking pretty basic, so I shut my linework off.",
    "Now it's time to do all the fun stuff, color and detail that sort of stuff.",
    "We are 34 minutes in, plenty of time to finish this up.",
    "See order.",
    "You mean Duke Nukem or wait?",
    "Was it called?",
    "No was about mythical Duke Nukem and Pok\u00e9mon Stadium.",
    "I'll talk about saving was a great game.",
    "Program.",
    "I like to compute.",
    "Newcomb was fun.",
    "I can remember my cousin had it on PC, recent download on my grandfathers computer.",
    "When we go to visit them and he got really angry 'cause he thought that it was not appropriate for children which it really was not appropriate for children.",
    "Any fans out there?",
    "This is a really simple.",
    "I draw.",
    "My nose is pretty much the same way.",
    "There's like two or three distinct shapes.",
    "They can range sometimes like so.",
    "Usually it's like a little button nose.",
    "Is there really easy?",
    "It's just like a little circle and then another one down here and then you add your folds as you see fit to help kind of bringing together the other knows is more of A.",
    "Kind of a closed shape and it's it's something like it's kind of like a Bert and Ernie knows where it kind of close up like that.",
    "It's it's right on top of the face between the eyes that always kind of creates a really cool sort of effect.",
    "And you can also change the color, which is nice, and the third nodes is always like.",
    "Not going to draw it, 'cause if it's not on the face looks extremely phallic so we can keep it at.",
    "I'll see.",
    "OJ plays guitar OK, cool Joshua.",
    "You play the banjo.",
    "That's bad as I've always wanted to learn how to play the banjo.",
    "I actually.",
    "I listen to a lot of like low fi hip hop, kinda vaporwave stuff.",
    "I also listen to a lot of punk rock kind of stuff but.",
    "I really love like real folk music, you know, and banjo obviously fits the bill for that.",
    "So that's really cool.",
    "Do you have any tips or tricks and someone who is considering buying a banjo?",
    "'cause I have thought about it multiple times and actually that would have been a good idea during this current team to get.",
    "That would be something to do.",
    "Yeah, let me go back so I'm going to use this to create like another.",
    "I call it a recess but like sort of like sunken in sort of vibe with his eye.",
    "Almost drank my beer from not the whole.",
    "Wait the 59 Les Paul Special.",
    "I'm pretty sure I have that too.",
    "I think that's why rock right over there.",
    "I have a Les Paul is it the are not the rosewood, the Raw Wood one where it's like on a red and you can see it.",
    "The town.",
    "That's awesome.",
    "Alright, I'll find someone then who will tell me, but thank you for the suggestion.",
    "Bands were really cool man soap instrument.",
    "So again, I use those circles to kind of create like a little bit of a recess in the eye.",
    "And now we're just going to kind of merge everything together.",
    "Boom, there we go.",
    "It's like set back now that's what those kind of things indicate.",
    "I can learn that trick from following an artist called Hatch art on Instagram.",
    "If you don't follow him, check him out at.",
    "I think it's just add Hatch Art he's from Australia or New Zealand.",
    "Something that I think I hope I did not just.",
    "Make that up, but he kind of does something similar with his eyes, and that's where I saw that trick and started doing it myself.",
    "And it really does add a lot of character to them, so it's kind of cool.",
    "Batman, I was like when I draw good I it's like.",
    "No, I'm spinning around the campus so much right now.",
    "I'm literally going to place this thing.",
    "Let's just feels more natural.",
    "So is anyone out there watching?",
    "Have any good tips?",

    "Let's add some color.",
    "Let's add some detail.",
    "Let's let's let's finish this guy up.",
    "So for color, here's how I pick my colors.",
    "You can go to either way either side, so just so everybody knows I move this toolbar out of wax my videos down in the bottom corner you can go down here if you pull it off and you move it somewhere else, you get 2 color wheels.",
    "They both do the same thing.",
    "I always reference my.",
    "I always reference my my my CC library that I have.",
    "I have one called colors rule that they were ones where I put all my colors.",
    "Tons of 'em I just sometimes I just go on and find color palettes and save it to hear like and you can do this through.",
    "Through an image capture, we can go to color.com.",
    "You can search the color, so I'll put that.",
    "You are all down in the description later.",
    "It's colored out adobe.com and click there.",
    "You can start saving stuff.",
    "Your CC library, then you can reference it on your favorite apps.",
    "Which software?",
    "I'm using Adobe fresco also.",
    "Thank you because you're saying it's going alright, so let's pick some cool linework color every time I do is always like to go with the background color first or I shouldn't say always.",
    "I'm starting.",
    "Don't like to go the background color first.",
    "You know we're talking bout zombie hands earlier, so this might be kind of fun.",
    "So the paint bucket selected who made a vector background and now I can just tap on my line work and fill it all in really quick with with the color of my choice like this Gray is pretty dope.",
    "I don't know.",
    "It's kind of hard to see.",
    "Let's see here say something best color palette.",
    "This was kinda funny.",
    "All right?",
    "Thinking like background colors and odd school.",
    "Let's fill are handing actually let's.",
    "Be.",
    "Easy to see.",
    "Hello.",
    "I've been on this weird binge lately of like.",
    "You know, I haven't even know like.",
    "Doing just like I will call monochromatic but like keeping with like one colour tones like choose cool colors on the whole thing to be color or a cool if I choose warm tones like something like this like that looks awesome right now, really big enough.",
    "Yes.",
    "I don't know what colors you all feeling you seen anything that you like?",
    "Let me know.",
    "Also, I apologize if I'm a little bit delayed in my response.",
    "I have a delay on the stream by about 20 seconds, so sometimes you might answer and I might not respond.",
    "It's not that I'm ignoring you, it's that I simply haven't seen him.",
    "Too much.",
    "Do something different.",
    "I did purple the other day or my most recent post.",
    "Please check that out.",
    "OK, alright like we're going.",
    "Really like where we're going?",
    "Where we're going?",
    "OK, it's kind of fun.",
    "Bring it back around now, you know.",
    "Let's see.",
    "What do we think about something like this?",
    "I don't like the hand color, but I like the line work in the background.",
    "The hand is like.",
    "Intense.",
    "It looks like a sports team.",
    "This could be Diablo game with come out now I know man I'm the same way man that game is.",
    "So I don't know for sure.",
    "Wagner is still in the chat.",
    "Please order my body sometimes launches, but he introduced me to Diablo and man does he write that game is great.",
    "So press here in the chat you get a shout out for introducing an excellent video game.",
    "So right now again, I'm just I'm toying with colors, I'm just trying to find something that that's going to work for this, and I think I'm narrowing in.",
    "No.",
    "And again, like.",
    "I'm also like stick and heavily like just the color palettes I have just to kind of find something that I like.",
    "We use the computer for it.",
    "We did trivia the other night.",
    "Puzzles seem to be a big one.",
    "So I'd be curious to hear whatever is whatever was doing what everyone's plan of attack is.",
    "For non screen related activities, I guess it could draw on paper, probably like.",
    "Got that up.",
    "So I am doing these lines on a new layer.",
    "Should put that out there I know.",
    "Keep that where it is face is going to come in somewhere like that, so it would be cool.",
    "Um?",
    "I always work on separate layers.",
    "I talk about this quite a bit, but for anyone who's new, always work on separate layers, so then I can erase and I can draw over and then.",
    "Not doing a very good job at it in my own technique, but then I can draw over it like that and get a really clean line where it connects.",
    "I'm pretty sure it's a studio, sorry, I'm reading mouse comment right now.",
    "I remember when I got it, it says that's really bad that I don't even fully know what guitar sitting by me and it's less ball, which is really nice.",
    "I got in a really long time ago.",
    "Like I don't even know I was younger.",
    "But I do love playing it.",
    "Right, so we got this.",
    "Got a fun.",
    "Doesn't have fun like freaking out mouth.",
    "So let's.",
    "Let's do this.",
    "Get another new layer.",
    "Let's turn off the pressure in the velocity dynamic through test line that is not thick enough.",
    "So we're going to raise the thickness rise up like 20.",
    "22 is probably pretty good.",
    "That's too thick.",
    "I don't want that 20.",
    "One thing I don't like about fresco.",
    "The slider is like really sensitive.",
    "All right, we're going to start on a new layer.",
    "An literally just draw inside all those shapes that I made.",
    "No, top his head is kind of lumpy.",
    "Sometimes I try to get like a big swoop in and.",
    "And it's really hard.",
    "To go all the way around, so I use the kind of like the jaw line to the ear.",
    "Look at the button and use the draw a line to the ear as like a way to try to like kind of get myself like a stopping point if you will.",
    "There we go.",
    "And there we go.",
    "So topic of the last stream.",
    "Everyone was talking a little bit about their about hopping in doing the daily challenges here on Behance.",
    "Is anyone watching participating in those and if so how's it going?",
    "How you enjoying AM?",
    "What's your favorite one you did so far?",
    "Let me know.",
    "Realize I just burped in, the microphone is like right next to my mouth, so I apologize if you want to start that.",
    "No, I'm not using white.",
    "I'm actually erasing the lines, so here's how it works.",
    "I can show you guys.",
    "You guys and gals how it's done, so we'll go with a transparent so you can really see it so.",
    "To go over some functionalities in Frisco really quick.",
    "When you make a line like this do do do right.",
    "There's a couple ways you can erase.",
    "They added two functions, and they're both really cool.",
    "Let me turn on my pressure dynamics, 'cause That's how you're going to really see this, and let's let's add some other like, let's just make a really abstract kind of Blob.",
    "One of the ways to do it is to grab your eraser tool like this.",
    "I just tap on it.",
    "It's right underneath the vector brush and you can just erase like that and it will maintain its gotta pressure sensitivity.",
    "It acts just the same.",
    "I usually keep mine really large.",
    "The reason being is 'cause I want to have the ability to quickly switch to something where I can erase in a large area.",
    "Now let's say don't want to race in a large area or I want to use the brush that I've been using.",
    "Let's say I'm drawing something with a pixel brush and I want to use it as an eraser.",
    "If you hit this little toggle right here, you can just erase.",
    "Just like that, and obviously 'cause all the vector brushes maintaining it, you know.",
    "Because I have a vector brush or something with texture, it'll keep that texture will act as an eraser and you can properly erase things.",
    "But you know, obviously you can change this to any way you want.",
    "You are.",
    "Yeah, let's do that.",
    "Oh, that's fun.",
    "Well, that's really funny.",
    "Let's make that line order little darker about.",
    "Oops.",
    "Not so good.",
    "Alright, we're gonna stick with this color palette 'cause this is really cool.",
    "I'm digging this alright, so let's add some detail we got.",
    "We got 20 minutes left ago here.",
    "Just out of Curiosity, General Bible Group.",
    "Rall friends, he can be as honest as you want.",
    "When watching these kinds of streams, do you prefer to see longer streaks or shorter stream?",
    "So I do kind of a mixed bag?",
    "OK, we will see you later.",
    "Follow me on here on the hands.",
    "It's behance.net backslash, fresh cake or just click on my profile.",
    "There should be like a little icon somewhere on the screen.",
    "You can click do me a follow 'cause then you'll get notifications when I go live.",
    "Anyway.",
    "Do you like longer, strange to artist like my Saturday night stream is fairly long.",
    "You know roughly two to three hours.",
    "This stream is a solid hour and then my time lapse is our five minutes, so let me know what you like.",
    "I'll try to do more of it.",
    "Anyway, adding in detail, let's add hairs inside tiny little hairs, so we're going to take our brush.",
    "We're going to keep the velocity dynamic, pressure, dynamic, onward, Turner, brush size down to like 3.5 and we're going to keep our color of our line work.",
    "I'm on a new layer and we're just going to draw in some like little, kinda like Grossness because all my things are gross.",
    "I've really taken to like disgusting art like just put in my hairs and blemishes and Macy's.",
    "This seems appropriate right now since you have to wash your hands every 5 seconds.",
    "Who?",
    "Sure.",
    "Just realize about like.",
    "If you are checking this out, your near the stream.",
    "The number has gone up since I last looked up at my monitor to see who all is viewing.",
    "If you don't know what's going on right now, my name is fresh cake.",
    "Oh my real name is Jayden Disimone, but I go buy fresh cake and that's how I know here on my hands.",
    "I am an illustrator.",
    "A whole lot of my inspiration comes from like old 90s cartoons.",
    "Things like Rocko's modern life Rugrats, Ed, Edd and Eddy Grim Adventures, Billy Mandy.",
    "I don't know if that will last one qualifies us 90s but late 90s early 2000s cat dog.",
    "Anything that was on Nickelodeon at any point in time.",
    "And that's kind of where I get my style from.",
    "Renton be that's another big one and this stream that you're watching right now is called happy hour.",
    "It is one hour 60 minutes.",
    "I drink beer currently tonight.",
    "I'm having the New England Brewing Co better known as Nabco Sea Hag IPA.",
    "6.2% alcohol by volume in a 12 ounce can and it's fantastic.",
    "Highly recommend getting it if you can.",
    "If you live in the New England area, it's kind of a stable.",
    "I think for most people in their French, neko is located in Woodbridge, Connecticut.",
    "It is.",
    "If you ever go to the brewery or find yourself there, don't be thrown off.",
    "It's in the back lot of like an old is zoozoo like car place or something like that but it's a fantastic little brewery limited.",
    "Great beer.",
    "Yeah.",

    "I do animate things every so often, so here's a fun fact for anyone that's curious.",
    "If you use Instagram or I message and you have giffy.",
    "Download, excuse me do you have jiffy downloaded on your phone?",
    "You get access to gifts and stuff on your iMessage.",
    "If you have Facebook or Instagram you can just search in a little gift search 'cause they use Giphy to power it.",
    "Just search for fresh paint FRESHCAKE, search for fresh cake.",
    "You're gonna find a bunch of animated gifs.",
    "So let's go to my bingo chunky eraser so I can get rid of this quickly.",
    "There we go.",
    "So that's how I do it so it's not white.",
    "It's actually I'm actually erasing and I get the really clean lines and everything because I do it on a separate layer underneath.",
    "And then I just kind of quickly remove it so.",
    "You can see it in action for real.",
    "We'll put our line in right here between to connect the mouth.",
    "Looks super lame and bad and then I hit that little toggle and I just erase it right up to that line and I get the clean sort of connection between the two.",
    "Just like that.",
    "Don't like how that line looks, so like I'm going to actually lose this I don't know.",
    "If I feel like his mouth should.",
    "Like I didn't do this right, so we made this out.",
    "Like let's see here.",
    "I feel like I should do something like that, you know?",
    "Or Do these lines just come all the way in hoopla?",
    "Disconnect this right here.",
    "Super weird, I don't like this.",
    "Put this lines doing to figure this out.",
    "Gotta figure out this part.",
    "Well, that kind of works.",
    "I only that right now.",
    "Let me give this a little bit more arc to it though.",
    "There it is.",
    "She's got a big Dome.",
    "Definitely made it a little bit too large, but that's OK.",
    "We can work with it.",
    "You know what actually we're going to lose the ear.",
    "See, it's always happens after I like closeout, the bigger racer like I was talking about.",
    "This always happens after I close out the rough sketch.",
    "Always look at it like mass, way too large.",
    "Grab the header grab from this point back.",
    "Here we're just going to pull it over to drag this down.",
    "And.",
    "Right now I'm jacking it up everywhere.",
    "How do I do this?",
    "No, I want to do this, let's see.",
    "Alright, looks like we're going big head 'cause I Drew.",
    "In those lines.",
    "Now you know what?",

    "Not much.",
    "This is multiple reasons why I like working in a digital medium.",
    "It's really fast to just fix stuff.",
    "Uh.",
    "You know?",
    "Sweet.",
    "Alrighty.",
    "Oh, let's clean this up.",
    "That would be bad.",
    "And let's take a swig of beer.",
    "So we are 45 minutes into the stream.",
    "This is happy hour.",
    "60 minutes of drawing wherever we net out is where we net out.",
    "I am realizing right now we gotta add some color to this guy.",
    "We gotta finish up this line work.",
    "We gotta add detail.",

    "Some stuff is really terrible, but.",
    "Have a really nice following, on Giphy.",

    "You can also follow on Instagram.",
    "There are some animations of 'em.",
    "I'll try to animate more.",
    "I think it's a little tough sometimes to do the Animations because they take time and you know I have a schedule of illustrations.",
    "I gotta kick out late for everybody, but I can definitely certainly try to make more of them.",
    "So let's let's add some blemishes and things in this guy.",
    "We kind of coming down the last 15 minutes.",
    "I will bring it up a little bit so I wanna get this thing done so y'all can see it finished.",
    "So to do blemishes, we're just going to make up brush super big and we just have along.",

    "This is a good place to be, especially right now.",
    "Alright, so I'm just adding in some like little I don't know little details in this thing.",
    "It's the details that really kind of count.",
    "With this stuff, you know.",
    "Realize it and add any kind of like fingernails on this hand, so I hope that doesn't bother anybody now the cartoony.",
    "I spoke to cartoon characters have fingernails.",
    "So if anyone's curious, as if there's a rhyme or reason for little marks I'm adding there is not I am just tap it around in space.",
    "It's just to add some texture you know at a little detail, give it a little something.",
    "Make it kind of stand out.",
    "Sometimes I add highlights which maybe I'll do that with this one.",
    "This we kind of found it, so sometimes a nice way to like comply with those highlights.",
    "Now I need away Superman, so take your end, taper off, turn off progression, dynamic over velocity dynamics turnover blush so something like 99.5, sometimes a really cool way to add implied highlights.",
    "I always say this is the beginning of the stream.",
    "60 minutes drawing and wherever I net out is wearing it out.",
    "I have yet to not finish drawing on the stream, so I feel really obligated to get it done.",
    "It's all good 'cause we got, you know, 15 minutes is plenty of time to finish this up.",
    "We're just going to have a little quicker.",

    "Alright, let's add some her in some detail on this guy.",
    "So first thing first, going here.",
    "He had like really short stubbly kind of a buzz cut so we're just going to do.",
    "Menu layer with Opacity and I think what I'm gonna end up doing is.",
    "You know what?",
    "We're going to lines.",
    "Crosses had to imply that he's got a buzz cut.",
    "You know what actually now he didn't have.",
    "Like short, let's just do this.",
    "Lower my opacity.",
    "Just to cover a large area, and then I'm going to go in and put all the detail.",
    "Think I talked about this in my last dream.",
    "One important thing when illustrating try to do the large areas first before you add the detail it's going to.",
    "Oof, I feel like I just lagged out really bad.",
    "am I still with everybody on the stream?",
    "I was just staring at it for a little bit, but I watched it like cut out for a second and then things went pretty rocky.",
    "So I apologize.",
    "I do feel Joshua Go back to your question.",
    "I do feel like I have a really good control.",
    "I've used both pens.",
    "I like the Apple pencil better.",
    "But at the same time I feel like I I didn't ever give the.",
    "The Surface Pen a fair shot, so I can't really speak to that.",
    "If it looks like I'm having better control, you might know better than I do.",
    "But I do like the Apple pencil.",
    "I use the Gen 1 pencil so I don't know if that matters to anyone out there.",
    "Also add some buzz marks in here 'cause.",
    "Yeah, it's sort of shorter hair, obviously.",
    "Alright, let's merge some stuff together here.",
    "I'm not love that haircut.",
    "I'm going to go back and redo that at some point.",
    "Who?",
    "Yes.",
    "He looks like a little kid.",
    "Start add in some details.",
    "They all had scruff, you know.",
    "Sorry folks, checking my discord.",
    "An illustration is to just take your line work and just kind of trace along and do something like that and put a little bit at the end.",
    "Kind of adds a little flavor.",
    "This was kind of a fun one.",
    "We could try it with.",
    "I haven't done this in awhile.",
    "My illustration work but I used to do it quite a bit.",
    "Actually really enjoyed it so I stopped.",
    "I think probably just my work progressed and I got away from it.",
    "Maybe we'll bring it back, oh.",
    "Yeah we can.",
    "We can work with this apparently.",
    "I drew on my hand, which I didn't need to do.",
    "Not a problem as in color back brush.",

    "Massive.",
    "That must be better.",
    "Hey, what's up George?",
    "How you doing?",
    "Welcome to the stream I.",
    "You seem like a new face.",
    "I don't think I've ever seen that before, so if you're new to watch him.",
    "A screen is black.",
    "You know it's interesting.",
    "I've asked people to do this.",
    "Can you take a screenshot and message it to me?",
    "Because a few people have told me that the screen is black and then they refresh your browser and it comes back.",
    "No problem going forward that along with the streaming team at Adobe or at the hands and let them know that some people are having that issue.",
    "'cause that's our recent thing.",
    "If anyone out there is watching this and you've got a black screen, please let me know.",
    "In the chat I really do need to know so I can share on my end watching it's looking grim, looking good, looking good or great.",
    "I tried to say people in German.",
    "So please let me know and George he said fine, does that mean like fine, you're back on and you can see me or does that mean like fine I'll reset my browser?",
    "No, I'm good.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Oh, I see your point.",

    "Pretty cool.",
    "Like I said, we're coming around now.",
    "We got a few minutes left here.",
    "Maybe I'll add some quick highlights in this character.",

    "Sometimes I export as a PDF, bring it into illustrator and I had some gradients and some fun stuff like that.",
    "You know?",
    "So that's probably where this drawing will end up and it'll get posted on Instagram and will get posted here in the hands will be super cool.",
    "So following both these places also I should have mentioned that's what the time-lapse looks like.",
    "By the way and I almost export it to my own computer.",

    "I do need to add in.",
    "Now here.",
    "Somebody asked me about this the other day actually, and while we're finishing up here, I'll bring it up since we're on the hour mark whenever I do my shading, it's really simple.",
    "All I do is I trace along the line like I create my awkward shape like you see here, and then I just trace.",
    "You can't see what I'm doing currently, but I trace along.",
    "The the outline and I'm using the same color as normal Ojai from Sydney, that's awesome.",
    "How are you holding up and how you holding up over there?",
    "Things are pretty crazy and then you can kind of see when I close that line by tracing along right here.",
    "It'll add time.",
    "It'll be able to fill in with paint bucket.",
    "I hope that made sense.",
    "If that didn't make any sense, head over to my last stream that I did.",
