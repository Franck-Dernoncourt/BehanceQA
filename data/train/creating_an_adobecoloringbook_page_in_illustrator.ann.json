    "There we are alright, so welcome everyone.",
    "Welcome Benjamin.",
    "I see your name.",
    "Hello everyone.",
    "Mirror and everyone.",
    "I go ahead and switch screens 'cause I want to get into this.",
    "We're working on this Adobe coloring book, which I think is pretty exciting to me and I love to be challenged so.",
    "Let me just switch over.",
    "Maybe?",
    "There you go.",
    "All right there we are there, we have it.",
    "You can see my screen.",
    "This is the Adobe coloring book and it's just a project that we thought we'd work on just to keep kids from being bored and adults from being bored.",
    "And here is the link that I can paste in chat for you as well.",
    "Say Hello.",
    "Hello, I see you there from Hungary, ICU, Tom.",
    "Good to see.",
    "Yeah, let's just pin this comment as well.",
    "You might be.",
    "Joining me from other places, it's always good to have you omati fivin and everyone.",
    "Sorry, everybody's names are so small right now on my screen, but this is at the Adobe coloring books, so we are at least a couple pages, right?",
    "So you can see chapter one which is all about the alphabet and we can scroll through the different artists and what they may.",
    "But the cool thing is they have a link right here.",
    "PDF, PSD, JPEG and I'm going to make one of these today, but we can check out this gorgeous work as we could see right here.",
    "Again, this is all about the alphabet made by different artists, which I think is pretty cool, so I'm going to work on page.",
    "Today we're going to get knocked out.",
    "Hopefully you enjoy it.",
    "I really like this by Ann Chin.",
    "I think that was awesome.",
    "Stay kind.",
    "Everyone.",
    "That's good advice.",
    "So Hello Felicia, good to have you in Natalie as well.",
    "And some people over there on Facebook I see you.",
    "Should I make the text little bit larger Johannesburg's in the House Chicago cool alright so.",
    "So you're also going to get a sneak peak as well, 'cause we have alphabet and then the next week was gratitude and now we have animals, which is book 3.",
    "But I'm going to work on when they actually should be released this week, which is all about.",
    "It's click over dreams or dreaming.",
    "So dreams.",
    "Whatever something like that, I'm going to do this all in illustrator.",
    "I already have a plan squared away so I'm going to go ahead and dive into this and we're going to have some fun creating what is going to be a black and white illustration.",
    "Will get into colourising it an again I might be jumping ahead a little bit, but you know sometimes I'll start with just a simple illustration.",
    "As you can see here, I'll hit N to bring up the pencil.",
    "I'll make sure the pencil tool is set to smooth 'cause I want to make this easy on me and it's not going to have any color, right?",
    "And I'll just kind of jump in here.",
    "I'm going to change this.",
    "Let's change the traditional light blue and somehow I changed my preferences for the anchor display.",
    "By the way, I usually make this larger so everybody can see it.",
    "But let's not worry about that right now, OK?",
    "OK, so let's dive into this.",
    "Here's my pencil.",
    "I'm going to start drawing.",
    "I'm just going to start outlining this face that I just imported.",
    "Just picked a pencil.",
    "It's just currently defaulting to.",
    "Let's make it 1 point.",
    "Notice how I wouldn't be on the cheek right here.",
    "I'll jump in and sort of.",
    "Just roll over that last part of that line and continue on my way.",
    "Anytime you screw up.",
    "Because of my preferences for the pencil, it set to edit selected paths.",
    "OK, so that means I can roll over my path.",
    "Right here and then draw again.",
    "And by the way I'm just using.",
    "A mouse, so I'm not using some fancy Wacom or anything like that.",
    "I did this a couple weeks ago for the Adobe Daily Creative Challenge.",
    "The illustrator daily creative challenge.",
    "So if you've seen this before, that's where it's from.",
    "Aaron, what's up high from nowhere Ohio?",
    "I'm sure you're from somewhere, but that's OK.",
    "I'll just bring this up and around.",
    "It's kind of do some park shapes in the hair.",
    "Bring that around like so we'll do.",
    "The ear is going to be a different shape.",
    "Just like that, and let's get this party started.",
    "It's going to be more than just outlining right?",
    "But we gotta start somewhere and I didn't want to cheat too much by having something already drawn, but I'm just going to jump into this because I want to get into text.",
    "I want to get a coloring.",
    "I want to get into new some fun brushes that we could really make this come to life quickly.",
    "And again, I'm just doing the simple shapes guitar collarbone in there like that.",
    "Something like that and I can continue this up, down and around K.",
    "You mess up.",
    "You could always roll over this.",
    "I often find that actually, if I work at a smaller screen size, it's actually easier.",
    "It's less distance that my mouse has to travel and I can get smoother herbs, right?",
    "So that's all I'm doing right now.",
    "Let me know if you have questions.",
    "Don't see alot happen in chat and maybe I just need to refresh this.",
    "Matt James, you're too kind.",
    "I'm so happy that you're here.",
    "Feel free to Holleran",
    "Good on Facebook.",
    "Alright, good have you Charles from Mexico.",
    "Cool alright, let's jump into the lips really fast just keeping this simple will outline the lips right now.",
    "OK so this is going to be a complete shape.",
    "In this case, since I want a little more detail, I might jump in here and take this right to the middle OK.",
    "And by the way, I could hit feet P for the pen tool and make sure it forecasts that line or Telegraph sit so I know where that next stroke is going, just like that.",
    "If you happen to put a point down autumn in it for it to be there, you could hold down the spacebar and pick it back up.",
    "But I'm going to draw that out.",
    "I have some snapping going on, not crazy about it, but let's go ahead and do that a lot of times you'll get this sharp edge right there at that point.",
    "Well, the properties panel click on stroke.",
    "And we'll round the corners book and I round caps typically right, and that's what we could do for the lovely lips, which I'm so tempted to color red right now.",
    "But again, I just kind of switch between the pen tool in the pencil tool as I create the mouth.",
    "So that's how I've done this illustration.",
    "I'm going to jump in.",
    "I'm going to show you something else really fast, so I have this.",
    "Let's take this down over here.",
    "I'm going to get into all these organic shapes for the eyes and everything right in the nose, right?",
    "Well again, I don't want to have a uniform line like that.",
    "OK, I actually want to jump in and I'm going to change the width profile to something a little bit more interesting, right?",
    "Changing that with profile so it's going to get thin, thick and thin again around.",
    "This knows I want it to be even thinner right over here, so we'll use the width tools will jump in, grab it right there, and shrink it down like so for that part.",
    "And again, I can make it thicker right here.",
    "But I have control over the thickness of that line.",
    "As you may know, since there are some pros here good to have you here.",
    "Rollo Salma sunlamp.",
    "Alright, cool you got that.",
    "I go through starts, outline the lines but I've already done a lot of this work but I will do that.",
    "I'll sometimes either outline the eyebrows.",
    "Like so.",
    "Or I'll make them filled right?",
    "I can do the same thing with just a single stroke.",
    "With the pencil drawing out this line, making this thick like so, cranking up the thickness and still using the width tool right in here.",
    "Grabbing Nishan, making it thicker on this side, and then thinner over here, for instance, let's just delete that point right there.",
    "You get the idea.",
    "OK, cool, let's move on 'cause I actually already have this done, so this is kind of where this is ended up.",
    "Let's just kind of jump ahead a little bit.",
    "Here's the woman outlined, filled in exactly as you'd expect.",
    "So this is the start of it, right?",
    "Looking good so far just by outlining photo.",
    "I'm going to take this word dream, right?",
    "Let's just take just the D right there, bam?",
    "Take idea, I'll shrink that down.",
    "I'll change this letter to R.",
    "Some of you might know what I'm going to do.",
    "I'm going to rotate it and make it smaller like so for my preferences.",
    "If I go into general, I don't want to.",
    "I don't want to scale strokes and effects.",
    "Keep the strokes and effects that keeping the same size so when I look at the stroke here, I always wanted to be like one point, for instance.",
    "So right over here I want to make sure this is one.",
    "Is always one point even when I size things down or make them larger, I might change that later, but right now I'm going to select these two objects and you guessed it, we're going to blend tool click click and we can blend those two together, right?",
    "Let's go ahead, go into blend an let's reverse.",
    "Riverside don't want to reverse the spine.",
    "I want to reverse front to back.",
    "Boom, there we are.",
    "Now we have that D like so let's go inside of it, Papa.",
    "We have this path and I'm sorry this is.",
    "Gray and kind of hard to see.",
    "Let me just change the color of it.",
    "Give me 1 second.",
    "Change this to green or something brighter.",
    "Or blue.",
    "There we go.",
    "So Cohen in here to two of the line in here as well.",
    "Well, I can replace this line just by drawing over it.",
    "That's what I want to do now.",
    "Make it kind of Sushi.",
    "Like that OK, give it a little bit of curve in a little bit of flavor.",
    "And just to make it like look a little bit more unique.",
    "Maybe I'll get rid of some of those points.",
    "I did the same thing with the pen tool, but now I can kind of have some fun with this.",
    "Taking this, let's rotate it.",
    "Like so there we have it.",
    "Right, you get the idea.",
    "Cool thing is you only need to do this once.",
    "Ha, let me check there we are There you are there.",
    "Everybody is.",
    "Let's paste this in one more time.",
    "There you go.",
    "I just paste it in the link.",
    "In case you didn't see that before to this coloring books, I could see all your names.",
    "Watch him from Tunisia.",
    "Awesome Tanzania.",
    "Tanzania, sorry about that.",
    "Two different places.",
    "So yeah, I can now kind of control that, so this is going to be kind of fun now, right?",
    "It could take this letter.",
    "This is looking pretty cool.",
    "I want it to be behind her head.",
    "It is great.",
    "I'm going to just duplicate it.",
    "Change the letter.",
    "Boo are well, guess what this other later later needs to be E.",
    "So D flows into RE AM.",
    "That's what's happening right?",
    "Let's take this.",
    "Let's rotate it around and move it down like that.",
    "And change this.",
    "To go over there.",
    "Cool.",
    "I can see all your names now.",
    "Melissa Collins in the house.",
    "What's up Melissa?",
    "Cool, so yeah, I'd have the same size and stroke sorrows here and loving it.",
    "Zorro, good have you got the coolest name in the book?",
    "Let's take a look at these little points right there that I kind of need to clean up.",
    "It's not going to matter 'cause it's actually behind her head, so I really don't need to worry about any of this.",
    "I can manipulate this all I want, but it's totally fine.",
    "Let's go back in here, boom, duplicated again as fast as we can.",
    "Let's get moving 'cause I want to colorize this 2E.",
    "Moving out like that.",
    "Let me know if you have suggestions.",
    "Maybe you like this.",
    "Maybe I should do something different.",
    "I want to get into different brushes as well.",
    "This one should be rotated differently.",
    "Now if I use my direct selection tool right, I can use my direct selection tool so I don't need to go inside of that object each and every time, right?",
    "I could just select this E, rotate it this way.",
    "Move it down, move that up, but you get the idea.",
    "OK, so you could use the direct selection as well.",
    "Change this.",
    "Hey Larry, our Dream Baby Dream Big Xiaoyi Move this over, move this down.",
    "Change this.",
    "Definitely let's move this over there like that.",
    "Get rid of some of these points.",
    "Alright, talk to me how you doing how Malcolm from Georgia?",
    "How are you doing today?",
    "How is Georgia doing, huh?",
    "How is Georgia?",
    "How is lovely Georgia?",
    "Let's grab that line.",
    "Poop.",
    "OK, grabbing his last letter M.",
    "Cool.",
    "It is beautiful Monday today I'm.",
    "Here in Lovely Denver, where Melissa is from as well.",
    "So JoJo from Las Vegas good to have you here.",
    "Let me know if you have questions.",
    "Again, sometimes we need to dream to escape and that's why this is OK, right?",
    "So far so good.",
    "We got this dreaming going on.",
    "We could add more to this right?",
    "We have this part.",
    "In fact, here's a.",
    "Here are some fun text.",
    "Here's some text below, right?",
    "So you can see how this is all created.",
    "You know how this is done anyways, right?",
    "Thank you Hayden, I appreciate it, but I want to add more to this.",
    "Actually want to do a cool burst in the background.",
    "You ready for this?",
    "I love this trick.",
    "I do this actually quite a bit more than I ever thought I would, but I'm going to do a burst.",
    "You're ready, here is a simple line.",
    "Excuse me, it's actually just an ellipse.",
    "A circle for this circle.",
    "I want to increase the stroke a lot, right?",
    "We're going to make it really big.",
    "In fact, I'm just going to type in like.",
    "500 to something like that.",
    "It's really thick, really big.",
    "Let's stretch it out.",
    "Kay?",
    "It is a circle.",
    "With a stroke of.",
    "500 pixels, sorry, you can't see that it's a stroke.",
    "Let's change the color.",
    "There it is.",
    "OK, so I'm going to go to properties.",
    "I'm going to stroke.",
    "And I'm going to change this to dash line right?",
    "So changing that to dash line gives us this cool burst now and this is what I want.",
    "I want like a burst of like 70 points.",
    "50 for the gap something like that, let's go.",
    "70 for the gap.",
    "Maybe?",
    "Ah, so this is.",
    "Check this out.",
    "This should work.",
    "Check this out.",
    "This little buttons important 'cause look at how it doesn't match up.",
    "You see in this Omo in Blanche see how this isn't quite matching up.",
    "This is unacceptable, but I'll go right over here.",
    "This little button aligns the dashes to corners and all that good stuff and now it falls into line and that looks good.",
    "So again, keep in mind this is a stroke so we could change this down.",
    "We go from 50.",
    "And you could see how it creates that cool burst.",
    "You get the idea.",
    "Ah Alright, fantastic.",
    "So I have this set to 500.",
    "That's what I'm going to do there.",
    "I'm actually going to expand appearance.",
    "And I'm going to expand these filled in the stroke, flip that around.",
    "Put some dots in there.",
    "Let's put some dots in there, shall we?",
    "Let's go down.",
    "Did you know in the Swatch libraries, there's patterns and I can go to these basic dots so I have all these fun dots that I can work with and for these dots.",
    "Check this out, I can add these dots as ultimately add these as a different color, but I'm just going to add this these dots as a different fill so there we go.",
    "We have these dots, a dot pattern that I can then change the sizeof or whatever, and that looks pretty cool.",
    "Not to mention that we're going to give it a stroke of one.",
    "OK, that's done.",
    "Let's move that appearance down there.",
    "Let's get rid of that.",
    "Let's turn on our other layers that we're working on.",
    "Boom, boom, right?",
    "Stream big baby right?",
    "I think this is already coming along nicely.",
    "Hopefully you're into it.",
    "Hatched.",
    "Alright, Oh my, how are you doing great useful trial at Jason?",
    "What's up?",
    "It will be up later.",
    "You could always just come back to this exact same link and it's going to be there.",
    "I want to add more to this, 'cause I think it needs a burst of color.",
    "It needs like Flowers and branches.",
    "If you know me that's it's not a pool stream and less.",
    "Unless there Flowers in it basically right?",
    "Well and I'm already have already have a lot of this squared away, so let's lock down everything and let's just turn this on 'cause I have some items right over here, right that are already created.",
    "Nothing too fancy, but we got some cool branches right in here, right?",
    "and I want to create a branch brush.",
    "Let's do that.",
    "Right now I'm going to grab this graphic, drop it into the brushes library and let's just expand that out.",
    "There are already a couple in there.",
    "But let's drop it into.",
    "My brush panel and we're going to make a scatter brush clicking OK.",
    "And we already have our scatter brush.",
    "Click OK.",
    "Here it is right here, OK?",
    "I'm going to draw with it.",
    "Just so you could see what we get.",
    "Let's select it.",
    "There it is selected.",
    "Let's draw.",
    "That's what we get for our brush, which is nothing terribly exciting, but I want to go in and change all these fun properties with.",
    "It's going to double click on that brush and go into.",
    "The options were going to change everything to random.",
    "And we're going to change this.",
    "It's going to go from 50% size to 150% size, and that's what I'll do I know 50% spacing to 150% spacing.",
    "Same thing for scatter negative 50% up to 150%.",
    "Something like that.",
    "The rotation it's going to.",
    "It's going to be all over the place, but once this is done you ready for this we can preview it.",
    "Bam, you get what's happening there.",
    "Let's go ahead and apply that to the strokes and you can see as I draw.",
    "I got these fun like scatter brushes for our lovely drawing 'cause what I want is a bunch of branches and again it's controlled by the stroke as well so I can come in fill in some branches down there like that and we could put some in the background as well.",
    "Yeah, that work for you.",
    "Ah, right, so again, super cool, super easy to work with, and that's what I did for all of these.",
    "All of these graphics are now brushes right?",
    "In here they're just being scattered everywhere.",
    "And now they're at my fingertips so I can jump in here and take this heart brush my double click on it.",
    "You can see it set up the pretty much the same way, except for it's not going to rotate, so it's not going to rotate.",
    "Everything else is going to be exciting about.",
    "It will come over here will select the heart.",
    "Will hit N for pencil and let's just kind of draw in some fun hearts.",
    "Can you see those hearts appearing kind of out of nowhere?",
    "It's kind of nice, right?",
    "Take him down in size, just a touch 'cause there a little large.",
    "Right, and This is why I like illustrator.",
    "It's like all of this is editable.",
    "Let's put some hearts in the background.",
    "Right, and they're just part of the background.",
    "As you can see, right?",
    "We can add some more Flowers.",
    "Why not?",
    "Possibly, but is having a good day.",
    "Let me know how you're doing or some more Flowers.",
    "Make those a little bit smaller.",
    "Draw another line, let's add these Flowers in here.",
    "Another set of Flowers as well.",
    "I'm just having fun right now, right?",
    "And here you have like within.",
    "I don't know when did I start I started.",
    "20 minutes ago and we already have something pretty cool that is starting to become our Adobe coloring book, which is kind of cool.",
    "Alright hello from India good to have you here.",
    "Uh, yeah, so pretty straightforward, you're welcome.",
    "Hello, thanks from Israel.",
    "Good to have you here Lori as well.",
    "Lovely effect on the letters which I already covered.",
    "We can get into coloring this by the way, so I'm going to Fast forward a little bit.",
    "Hello, here's a let's do this, which I already have some created.",
    "So this is what I would do.",
    "By the way, we can make color versions of all of these brushes.",
    "Technically we have to make new brushes, but I have color versions of this heart, right?",
    "So again, what did I do I just took and made a color heart right over here.",
    "There it is.",
    "There's our friend.",
    "Let's make it pink.",
    "Right drop it in here.",
    "Make it a scatter brush and everything scattered right?",
    "So again, you do have to make supper brushes that are not editable afterward, which is kind of a bummer, right?",
    "But we want to randomize all these settings.",
    "All these letters I usually give them exact numbers, but you get the idea.",
    "Click it, OK, there's a new brush, right?",
    "Our new color brush so we can go in and select.",
    "Uh, just so everybody could see.",
    "Here are my hearts.",
    "I could select all these hearts and use these new brushes every time I click on it.",
    "I get a different rendition since it's a random, OK.",
    "So that's what I would do for all my brushes, right?",
    "Make a.",
    "Color version of them again, was painting with the Flowers over here.",
    "Excuse me with the with the hearts.",
    "These guys are more versions writes everything is kind of on its own crazy layer.",
    "But let's take some of these same thing here.",
    "Select these.",
    "There we go, different versions right colored as well.",
    "So that's how I ended up with this so you can see our initial line drawing right.",
    "All these are just a bunch of scribbles 'cause there a bunch of paths with a brush applied to them, right?",
    "And you can see this version.",
    "Here is an interesting one.",
    "Is this pencil right?",
    "Look at this fun pencil right?",
    "So how is this made?",
    "Pencil was made?",
    "And actually what I did is I started making different versions and these are my field lines, but let me show you this ready.",
    "I'm going to take this pencil, drop it in here and I'm going to make it an art brush clicking OK.",
    "I'm going to make sure that it only stretches between.",
    "These two guides, so only the metal parts going to stretch and it's going to maintain the proportions of the eraser and the end of the pencil.",
    "So now when I go over here, in fact I want to maybe get rid of the other pencils altogether.",
    "Make a new layer selecting my pencil hit N.",
    "But there we are, drawing a pencil with a pencil, right?",
    "Super fun.",
    "Zoop you get the idea.",
    "Cool.",
    "Let's add some in the background.",
    "And let's get to the last little bit that I want to do.",
    "Again, there's all sorts of pencils back there.",
    "Now let's jump ahead to.",
    "This final version you ready for it?",
    "There's more I need to show, by the way.",
    "Here's one that has been colorized OK, so Justin, Jesse, you know I went through when I edited all of these.",
    "All of these letters as well, so let's just go ahead and show you just the letters which I showed you earlier and they can transition from one color to the next.",
    "OK, so if I select this letter right, will select this one up there it is.",
    "Let's open this up.",
    "Change the color too.",
    "A lovely pink will change this one down here to a green and it will make that nice transition for this one.",
    "It's going to be the grade right down here.",
    "We select it.",
    "Will you go back to say blue for instance?",
    "But again, that's how this was put together and hopefully you're catching a vision for how this is done, right?",
    "And this has been around awhile, but pretty pretty fun and easy to work with.",

    "So I went through and just added color to her.",
    "I added the only gradient I haven't here is for her cheeks, just gave her a little bit of rosiness for her cheeks, and I felt like it needed it.",
    "If we could see that right there.",
    "OK, here are my branches.",
    "Here's some more Flowers that are colorized.",
    "Here's.",

    "She could always just remain.",
    "I don't want her turning purple or some weird colors are going to lock her down.",
    "We're going to select everything else and we're going to go to edit, edit colors, and we're going to recolor this artwork here.",
    "All the colors I can go into edit.",
    "I can lock this down and I can start shifting the colours anyway I want.",

    "Hopefully that makes sense.",
    "Shahid Calm down buddy.",
    "Yeah, and this will be available live.",
    "I'm not crazy about these colors.",

    "Writes Bryan, doesn't this work?",
    "Doesn't in this nice.",
    "Yes they say it stay home, everybody just be chill, hang out with me.",
    "Just appreciate you being here but I love this recolor artwork.",
    "I honestly don't even need to tweak it at all.",
    "It looks just looks so good, but I could go into some of these others and you can see how ugly they will turn out.",
    "Maybe not bad, but this one obviously was out in the sun too long.",
    "Here's one that was made 100 hundred years ago, 'cause that's the color scheme I'm getting from this one, you know, but I really like beach for.",
    "And we'll just change it back to it.",

    "We started here where did we start?",
    "We started with something like this which is our color are outlined drawing.",
    "Tried some different brushes, some different colors, right?",
    "I started to outline all the brushes as well and then we ended up with this one.",
