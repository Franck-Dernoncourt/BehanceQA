    "Discuss started.",
    "This is Delta TM.",
    "And we're going to go ahead and get this live stream on.",
    "Who's ready?",
    "If you're ready say I'm ready there.",
    "Bump bump bump.",
    "Hopefully the music is not too loud if it is.",
    "Please let me know.",
    "and I will turn it off.",
    "If we have to hear I am.",
    "Hopefully the syncing with the sound and the video goes well.",
    "We're going to double check that for a second and see what we got.",
    "Uh-huh.",
    "Oh, it looks good, I like it OK cool.",
    "Sorry about that.",
    "I gotta do that in the beginning.",
    "You gotta double check that things are working and like I said if the sound is a little too strong.",
    "I can turn it down.",
    "We are listening to the sounds I forget what is college so yeah, it's up there?",
    "Let me go ahead and?",
    "On hide it.",
    "Fat cat fat cat's playlist.",
    "It is fat cats presents and there's a different songs.",
    "This was called bleeding.",
    "I don't know why he's leaving but it's all instrumentals and it's pretty cool alright.",
    "So let's go ahead and get going?",
    "What are we doing damn?",
    "What's going on here?",
    "Well, I have my Adobe fresco.",
    "It is ready to go that rhymes Adobe fresco is ready to go.",
    "And I guess I'm drawing on and if you've been watching some of these live streams.",
    "You'll know that I've been sitting here drawing the alphabet.",
    "We worked on the alphabet a little bit.",
    "Let me get so here is pretty bright.",
    "We've been working on the alphabet A little bit at a time as time permits finished the letter.",
    "I did the Knights an now we're going to get on with the letter J?",
    "It is taken a lot of Sessions Because.",
    "I have to find squeeze in some time to work on this 'cause this is a passion project in mind.",
    "And so I started the sketches and let's see if we can do the J just look at the J.",
    "Turn on the initial sketch, it is a shapes with all the shapes only shapes do you think of?",
    "When you first start sketching you get into idea out you need are just working sketch in shapes just get the shapes out see how you're able to visualize the idea that you have in your head and so once I did the sketch.",
    "Once I got the shape out the font style and the Clutter?",
    "How want the flow of the.",
    "Shapes to look then I went ahead and that a cleaner sketch and this one is now featuring the details of what a brush pen is I see a color palette.",
    "Pens markers, I see the Centriq Stylus, so you bring in some of the detail to see how it flows.",
    "But even at this stage, you want to keep it in a sketchy.",
    "Pencil sketch, drawing so that you can always adjust an clean up and let that composition.",
    "Talk to you see if this is what you want.",
    "So now that I did that with the letter.",
    "Ji am going to start with the inking which in this case is going to be the vector brushes.",
    "So on the right hand side.",
    "We have our layers.",
    "We cannot see my control, so let me fix that real quick for you.",
    "There it is there, we go?",
    "I'm using an app called Cinna maker to live stream air.",
    "It is save it boom now.",
    "You can see it so on the right hand side you see where my layers icon is I can turn the layers off and on or hide him and bring him out.",
    "So I had my layer.",
    "So when I'm laying my hand on that right side you don't see I don't know accidentally hit some of a different layer and then I end up drawing underlayer that I don't want to.",
    "On the left hand side have more brushes.",
    "The 3rd brush icon from the Top is the vector brushes.",
    "The thickness on my lines is 3.5.",
    "Let me bring that out for you so you can see it there.",
    "It is the thickness of the brushes 3.5.",
    "The color is blue.",
    "I'm not used any other colors.",
    "I did for the pencil in it.",
    "I guess I sure did it started with the black color that might have been already set and then the purple to do this.",
    "Pencil sketching and I'm using the blue and I just use different colors for the different layers.",
    "So that I can recognize what I'm looking at an when you zoom out and look at this and you know the color difference gives you an idea of what you're looking at in that dark blue is the vector lines so that's my vector brush.",
    "My brush settings.",
    "I need to turn out that pressure dynamic so I was doing a little bit of testing with a with a stylus.",
    "Earlier and I ended up turning that on so that I could test the sensitivity the pressure.",
    "So, there, it is I got what I need right sometimes I check these things sometimes I forget.",
    "Because I'm here with you, I am checking them so that I can give an explanation of what we got going on Alright.",
    "So here we go.",
    "Now it's time for the letter J Let's go ahead and get started.",
    "And the first things that I do is just tackle something don't worry about what should I start with where should I go.",
    "Let's just do something right.",
    "So here we have a pencil this upside down and come on here we go.",
    "There we go no, I don't want that line.",
    "There we go.",
    "There we go the pencil cool.",
    "And let's do that one again boom.",
    "There it is we got a pencil.",
    "Where is drawing done you gotta shake of- whatever things that happen in your life let them all back off of you and get into your drawing mode.",
    "That's what we're doing right now, getting into the drawing mode.",
    "So right now, I'm feeling like everything else is OK.",
    "I'm comfortable with it, so let's just start drawing.",
    "If you've been following this series, you'll know that I am.",
    "Focused on drawing all these are tools.",
    "But.",
    "I wanted to have a organic field.",
    "Wanted to feel like their actual real drawings.",
    "And not like a uh.",
    "Very traditional vector illustration that has very.",
    "Sharpen clinical look.",
    "That's it.",
    "All right.",
    "Less a key role in.",
    "I am going to draw this pen, but now when I draw this pin here.",
    "I don't want it to be next to the color palette the way it is so I started a new layer and I'll start drawing this pin this brush pen.",
    "There we go.",
    "And once I'm done drawing it.",
    "What I want to do is move it?",
    "So that's why I draw it on a different layer.",
    "We do have the.",
    "Lasso tool so we can move things if we want to, but it's easier to just go ahead and do it.",
    "This way look at that boom boom boom there.",
    "It is done.",
    "I love it.",
    "New layer just keep working in layers.",
    "Ah was going on what's happening.",
    "Let me see thank you for leaving a comment and I'm gonna have to look up and see what that means let me see maybe I can do it now.",
    "Search Google what's up, Google you gonna tell me what that means.",
    "Translate it.",
    "Bone bone bone bone.",
    "Great painting painting is a great experience.",
    "Huh maybe that's not what Google saying thank you.",
    "I appreciate it.",
    "Appreciate it.",
    "It said 9:00 o'clock in Atlanta.",
    "So I expect to see people who are tuning in to be in other parts of the world where still daytime.",
    "So a new layer.",
    "And let's do that come on, there, it is.",
    "Dumb dumb dumb dumb.",
    "Go here.",
    "Yes, that would check that right there, I heard beep.",
    "So thanks again.",
    "Lots of beeps.",
    "There we go.",
    "I think I left one of the.",
    "Either discord probably discord on notifications.",
    "A shadow boxing.",
    "There we go bomb on like that tip.",
    "Fix it every day is only.",
    "Mom had to go here, we go here, we go.",
    "There it is cool get another pan moves.",
    "You gotta be careful with the way you touch.",
    "The screen, yeah, let's move that over.",
    "'Cause I'm on the surface, so the surface version of Adobe fresco has much more sensitive touch controls than the iPad.",
    "I know because I tried them both.",
    "Alright and why am I drawing on the iPad.",
    "I mean on the surface instead of the iPad because I do like the way.",
    "I can export.",
    "On the iPad directly into my.",
    "Files.",
    "I mean, like how I can export from the surface directly into my files.",
    "And then we're asking the iPad you export to drop box and then it syncs up with your.",
    "Computer and then that's when you grab the file so you want to always export.",
    "As a PDF when you're working with vector brushes so that way.",
    "You cannot open that file in Adobe Illustrator, an have full control of your.",
    "Anchor points.",
    "An scalability.",
    "Uh-huh.",
    "OK, I like that pan.",
    "I wanna move that pen over so that it's sticking out.",
    "But once that happens, then it's going to yeah, so there, it is.",
    "It's cool like that right there boom done.",
    "So then that line is going to stop right there, OK OK.",
    "That's cool.",
    "That's alright.",
    "It's good.",
    "I like it OK, OK, yeah, I'm just looking thinking drawing.",
    "I'm using a lot of layers right now, but I'm going to go ahead and not not merge that one 'cause that one has crossover thing so less a merge now let's wait for the merging.",
    "OK, we gotta Wacom pen here.",
    "There we go.",
    "Yes.",
    "OK, so get the eraser.",
    "Uh-huh.",
    "Razor always starts off kinda big no matter how many times, I adjusted as soon as you close the program.",
    "That eraser resets.",
    "There we go, we got that.",
    "I'm OK with this list still turn it a little bit.",
    "You know what let's stick it right there, it's kind of.",
    "A large but You know it's going to be OK so.",
    "There's my pen.",
    "The yeah, yeah, yeah, there, we go so it's kind of long and still got plenty of room.",
    "There it is.",
    "Slow cricket, yes, wake her kids, don't like it.",
    "Let's go.",
    "And I have the Surface Pen, so I can turn the pencil around and start using the eraser without actually selecting the eraser tool, which is only possible on the surface.",
    "Horace antique.",
    "Not in the iPad pro.",
    "So now, what this fix that here.",
    "There we go.",
    "Looks Super Crooked.",
    "Super thick let's go here, we go that was pretty sweet line now.",
    "Go here like that and like that.",
    "All of it is not like it.",
    "Delete it.",
    "AMA delete layer community one.",
    "Hum.",
    "OK.",
    "Now let's do this again.",
    "There it is.",
    "There we go now we're looking at the pen right now.",
    "There it is Allah's cat.",
    "I live with that one.",
    "And now Make a line there.",
    "Erase a bit of this here.",
    "As you know that's the button.",
    "That's where the button goes.",
    "There we go.",
    "Love it.",
    "OK.",
    "We got that.",
    "Now let's.",
    "Work on.",
    "Adjust in some of these.",
    "So that was cool, let's go, like that.",
    "Uh-huh Yeah, I'm cool with that.",
    "So now one more layer is going to give me the line.",
    "So I'm going to draw the lines and this other layer for the letter J?",
    "So I gotta take this letter this word is lying.",
    "There.",
    "And then here.",
    "There it is.",
    "Yes, I like how the airline in there.",
    "No, I'm not.",
    "There we go.",
    "Yeah, let's let's see if we can take it all the way through.",
    "I.",
    "All right.",
    "No.",
    "Very cool see so now.",
    "They go in.",
    "Some of these layers to start erasing things.",
    "Right that one is going to get some erasing I am noticing a lag.",
    "In Frisco.",
    "I think it has to do with all these layers and I think part of what I'm gonna do.",
    "Tonight is clean up some of these layers so that I can get rid of them.",
    "Because I want fresco to respond and then have to respond to what I'm doing and not work keeping.",
    "Track of my layers.",
    "Pricing goes that one that one.",
    "This one.",
    "Uh-huh.",
    "That's The One.",
    "As Skagit.",
    "Uh-huh.",
    "And that's where the line that I need it.",
    "Scrap this one.",
    "Outta here.",
    "Beautiful very good letter J?",
    "Every is letter chain.",
    "So.",
    "It's actually not the letter J Oh well.",
    "The letter J does need some clean up there, we go.",
    "Uh we got those pieces so now.",
    "Yep is that although yeah, that needs fixing in this needs fixing.",
    "OK.",
    "There goes.",
    "There we go.",
    "Oh.",
    "There it is I got it now, let's go ahead and combine some of these layers.",
    "March down March down.",
    "I don't see any overlaps.",
    "Good good.",
    "Perfect.",
    "Erase her get rid of that thank you.",
    "New layer another pen.",
    "Boom boom.",
    "Huh.",
    "Good I like it.",
    "As seen.",
    "Uh-huh.",
    "Very good eraser.",
    "Get erased this line.",
    "So I go past that line.",
    "Where I know I'm going to erase it so that I can get into that zone for that line way before I actually need it.",
    "And you get a much cleaner line then.",
    "Let's get this Jiang.",
    "In this case here, I have to start, where I need it.",
    "And I'll start, where it needs to go no big deal.",
    "I've done this before whoops wrong.",
    "Later I'm going to stay in the same layer here it is.",
    "But this one, I'm going to go ahead and merge that.",
    "Very cool.",
    "So we got a couple of spots.",
    "No, don't do, do, do, do too, but not cursing Tupac long cars.",
    "Hi.",
    "As long as there were no cursing were good.",
    "I will look at who are looking good good good so let's go ahead and go ahead and do this marker here.",
    "Let me see I'm in a new layer.",
    "Vector.",
    "Brush.",
    "There we go.",
    "Like than those lines are outside of your drawing of your letter J as OK.",
    "'Cause I'm going to.",
    "Switch it up.",
    "Uh-huh.",
    "Scared.",
    "The side clean that up.",
    "There we go, we see that's cool that's cool yo.",
    "So let's do the other side of that marker.",
    "Done.",
    "I kinda like it.",
    "Let me know what you think.",
    "There we go.",
    "Nice that's it that's the letter J.",
    "This is pretty simple is let me turn that off so we can see everything.",
    "Merge down looks OK.",
    "It's a little weird right there with those 2 pins are but I think we can live with that.",
    "Boom.",
    "You gotta sign your name is still 2019.",
    "We have some time left to work on our pieces.",
    "Now that I finished the letter.",
    "J you know what I need to make a screenshot.",
    "Go up to export boom export It says Vector.",
    "I was going to be vector Jay.",
    "Export is on the bottom it's on behind my head if I can turn off my head.",
    "You can see the rest of it boom export.",
    "PDF is sujay save.",
    "It is saving in the same folder where everything is.",
    "That I am in saving along.",
    "Is it this is getting to be a big document?",
    "And what I'm going to do is get rid of some of these layers now, so that's done, I'll just do that now right.",
    "So there's the whole alphabet and as you can see.",
    "Here on the right size.",
    "Yamma layers right so the letter, A?",
    "Has that one layer?",
    "Let's turn that off there's a second a layer?",
    "Which is for the sketches.",
    "And then There's a third layer and that was when I was first testing out this technique.",
    "So let's go ahead and get rid of that layer 'cause.",
    "It's a pixel layer and we don't need anymore.",
    "But we will keep the the last 2A layers will keep that one and will keep this one.",
    "The belayer has 3 also there's one that one.",
    "There is the second sketch layer.",
    "And then finally the 1st.",
    "Shape layer for the Bing so when I started the alphabet.",
    "I did a lot of testing with the letter, A an and then I once I figured out what I wanted all the less the rest of the letters.",
    "I just went ahead and did the sketches with shapes.",
    "Delete layer gone but will turn back.",
    "This one on done let her see it.",
    "Same way that's that one.",
    "This is the one that needs to go.",
    "Delete it.",
    "And then let's get this one, the D delete that.",
    "The A.",
    "Delete that.",
    "So the F has 3 layers.",
    "Also, there's 1 layer.",
    "We want this layer.",
    "We don't want.",
    "Delete it.",
    "The gene.",
    "The late Feels like I've done a lot of drawings as you can see.",
    "Delete the eye.",
    "And then the J is the last one so let's.",
    "Delete the number 3.",
    "Delete now we're at the K so indica.",
    "We have the last sketch and the shape sketch, so let's go ahead and delete this shape sketch delete it.",
    "Else, the same way.",
    "Delete it let me put the came back.",
    "And I think that's good this is good, I am just the MN.",
    "Assad delete this.",
    "I could combine them.",
    "But I think it's I don't want to strain.",
    "Fresco nordone strain, the surface to keep this, let's seize S.",
    "Delete original St.",
    "OK, the S came back 'cause I double tapped.",
    "And then this team.",
    "What's going on with that team?",
    "That, he has.",
    "Something going on let's see yeah.",
    "I can tell 'cause you can see in the little picture inside the.",
    "The layers.",
    "The.",
    "You.",
    "Wait can you see the V?",
    "There it is.",
    "There we go W.",
    "X&Y.",
    "And then Z.",
    "And let's delete these other layers.",
    "These layers that could be also I think as these are jpegs that I brought in.",
    "Is uh?",
    "Uh-huh.",
    "Look at this group's not undo what happened.",
    "I think I.",
    "Double click, too hard.",
    "OK, here, we go.",
    "COO COO COO yes here what does this say?",
    "As my signature.",
    "Delete it.",
    "There has my process.",
    "An another signature I bet so let's delete that.",
    "Cool.",
    "OK very good.",
    "So we're looking at.",
    "Let's go to the letter KABCDEFGHIJK here, we are.",
    "Turn down the opacity get a new layer.",
    "We got our vector brush.",
    "I know it was a little boring.",
    "I'm sorry, but that's that's what you do you you have to manage your layers you have to manage your?",
    "File.",
    "Otherwise, there crashes things happen, you lose work and then you just get mad.",
    "All right, so here we go let's go, like this.",
    "And.",
    "Who knows what this is?",
    "This is A Palomino pencil.",
    "Alright let's go here.",
    "All right.",
    "Uh-huh.",
    "Very cool got it.",
    "Marker.",
    "Fat marker.",
    "Nice awesome.",
    "Thank you Alex I appreciate that I appreciate the comments y'all.",
    "Let me know I'm not here by myself.",
    "Even though I can I am here by myself just saying.",
    "You can if you kinda here with me.",
    "However, this good.",
    "And I can move that one around.",
    "I think I I first I had a lot of intersecting pencils and markers and things and now that I'm looking at it.",
    "I really don't want all of those intersections happening.",
    "OK.",
    "So let's draw, some of these.",
    "Uh-huh.",
    "OK.",
    "Uh-huh.",
    "It's kind of Crooked I don't like it.",
    "So Kay is drawing again.",
    "Mary cricket, it's a matter fact I think I missed some parts of what I wanted to do here.",
    "There we go.",
    "All right got it.",
    "See let's see let's see yeah.",
    "I like the angle of it, but I need to bring it down cool new layer.",
    "Ha.",
    "Thank you thank you.",
    "Thank you Alex.",
    "Let's go here.",
    "Is a funky pan?",
    "You know, some of those free pants, you get at conference says an Atta.",
    "Hotels and conventions.",
    "Do that here we go.",
    "And it looks like the mandalorian like that's a helmet that's crazy.",
    "Alright let's go here.",
    "Uh-huh.",
    "Move that right there, too far right there's good.",
    "Now what I don't have here right now is.",
    "A spray can a did not do one in the eye or the J?",
    "Or the H Who?",
    "Oh, OK is time so.",
    "You know what I'm gonna do 1st I'm going to draw some of these pens out first.",
    "Like this.",
    "Who?",
    "All right.",
    "Marker.",
    "There we go.",
    "So now because I drew that marker there I can put it anywhere else.",
    "I want I am going to move it.",
    "So my friend this is moving out the way draw another layer and then I'm going to back up this file because there was a lot of edits means draw great great work Oh.",
    "Alex thank you.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Thank you.",
    "I did look that up and it will say something about but you know, Google search.",
    "Great painting and so I kind of I kind of.",
    "Figured out not the literal translation, but something similar it would mean something similar.",
    "I appreciate that.",
    "There we go.",
    "I welcome all comments in any language.",
    "I may just have to look it up later.",
    "And that's not a good line.",
    "Super cricket come on.",
    "2 fingers.",
    "Uh-huh.",
    "Bum.",
    "So we're looking.",
    "Spray paint, Canada like it, I'm gonna go with it.",
    "Dumb.",
    "This seems happening here.",
    "We're good, we're good and.",
    "Very good.",
    "So.",
    "This is the point where I need to just start drawing the bottom of the K.",
    "An I can bring in this other layer.",
    "Are you tripping on me YouTube?",
    "Yes.",
    "There we go.",
    "I'm going to tap that one move it.",
    "And that goes into the center.",
    "Of the K.",
    "OK, it's done.",
    "And let me save this work.",
    "Let's see what happens, I did a lot of editing and so let's make sure this fresco saves.",
    "Saving document boom come on, there, it is.",
    "It's a lot and there should be a little sinking their egos.",
    "It was went really fast.",
    "You can't see it from your angle.",
    "Now let's get back on there's a little cloud.",
    "And it shows you that something was saved and there, it is we're still good.",
    "I like it, it does feel like a little later we'll see once I start drawing.",
    "Cool, OK now let's go ahead and draw our line got the vector brush boom actually let's do it nice and clean.",
    "There it is.",
    "Uh-huh.",
    "Alright I looks OK, it's coming along.",
    "What do you guys think let me know or mom?",

    "Uh-huh.",
    "OK.",
    "I'ma leave that line for last.",
    "Or for later right now, I'm going to go down the list of tools that I have here.",
    "And start erasing some parts like this.",
    "And I was too big is because my eraser size?",
    "Here we go.",
    "Nice.",
    "Uh-huh.",
    "So now.",
    "Yeah, let's erase that one there.",
    "There we go that's good.",
