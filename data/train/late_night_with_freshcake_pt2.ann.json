    "My my.",
    "Discord of everything.",
    "That sentence didn't make any sense.",

    "It's vector brush, so for anyone new to fresco there are several new brushes.",
    "Are there several brush that's there's pixel brush which they just recently added a bunch of new stuff too.",
    "I don't know where they are exactly thing under like painting that in a ton of new paint brushes, but these act like your basic Photoshop brushes, so if you select one you start painting and drawing.",
    "You get cool textures and stuff like that pretty smooth.",
    "There's some really cool things in here.",
    "You can import Kyle brushes.",
    "You can import brushes just like you do in photo shop, no problem.",
    "And yeah, they're really nice.",
    "There's a lot.",
    "There's a ton of options than the other one that everyone really likes is the live brushes, which are basically watercolors and oil paints, and you can do really cool things with this, such as make a new layer, like if you grab this watercolor here and click and then you can kind of paint it on and it will bleed just like a normal watercolor, and I think if you hit.",
    "The three dots you can then hit dry layer.",
    "It will freeze wherever that bleed out was occuring.",
    "So that's what those brushes are.",
    "And then I use oops.",
    "I like to use the vector brush.",
    "Interesting only the first dream.",
    "I wonder if and only if it only posts the replays.",

    "Now you gave us the Pantone number.",
    "That's hardcore.",
    "Did you like look that up, or did they tell you 'cause like not really curious is that because like most places don't, you never know what the Pantone color is.",
    "Oh yeah, the blending is awesome, so like check this out here.",
    "So for those of you that don't know what there is referencing is that you can take a color like let's say this and will do a cool pixel brush really quick.",
    "Let's let's use the rake that I had right then.",
    "You can take the watercolor and let's take a color and then you can go here and you can draw over and it will bleed out whatever that pixel is underneath.",
    "But then you can also grab like another color with your watercolor and kind of go there and it starts to bleed it just like a normal watercolor does.",
    "It's pretty incredible.",
    "You could dry layer and so you can make some really cool gradients.",
    "You can do some awesome stuff with it like it really is spectacular if I do say so myself.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Bob Ross, just remember there are no, we don't make mistakes, we just make happy accidents.",
    "Chris, I've had that happen to these things come loose like mines.",
    "There we go.",

    "I usually screw mine in super extremely tight, like in hopes that like you know, it doesn't come loose, but it does happen.",
    "And you know what else is funny?",
    "When I bought this I got like spare nibs.",
    "I've never had to swap the nib on it, so I'm curious as to when that has to happen.",
    "Like I wonder if I come over do like is it like guitar strings and you should swap than it out like you know every so many weeks or whatever?",
    "Or is it like?",
    "Does it get chewed up?",
    "I don't know.",

    "There are some streamers the other day that did like a collab.",
    "One.",

    "Well, there's a couple ways you can approach that.",
    "One, I know exactly what you're talking about.",
    "It's hard to convince people if they think they don't need it.",
    "One of the best ways that I have often found to convince somebody whether or not they need the help and you don't have to be as crash or forward about this.",
    "But like prime example, my buddy of mine was starting up something on his own and we were talking about you know what kind of what he needed for logo design.",
    "He was talking about using just some kind of cheap quick generating service and he's like it works against the job done.",
    "I don't need anything fancy for what I'm doing.",
    "People in my business or my field, don't?",
    "You know they don't care about that kind of stuff.",
    "My kind of clients and I made the point of telling that listen if you were to interview somebody, are you going to hire the guy that comes in a nice suit or you going to hire the guy that came in in jeans and a dirty T shirt?",
    "He's like, well, I would hire the guy in the my suit.",
    "I was like exactly the same thing with your brand.",
    "People aren't going to want to come to you if your brand looks like you know.",
    "Booty cakes like you gotta you gotta, you know you want your brand to be the guy in the suit.",
    "In the interview you don't want your brand to be the.",
    "Giant Indiana dirty T shirt.",
    "So sometimes that's a good way to approach it.",
    "If you approach someone that we don't need a willing to spend the money like, we're fine the way we are.",
    "Another good way also is just to point out and kindly do this.",
    "Don't be a jerk about it, but the kindly point out some of the areas as a professional designer that you're seeing flaws and how it could improve their business and a lot of times when people think they don't need help.",
    "They just don't understand or they don't see the vision.",
    "And that's kind of your place as the artist.",
    "Well, that was really helpful advice is now.",
    "All right, so we're adding in some eyebrows went ahead and some tired lines as per huge.",
    "Little distant from everything, let's actually go back with a new layer.",
    "This way we kind of have the flexibility to share some things up when we're done, not something good.",
    "We're doing a class stream going to hit you up on the side.",
    "We're going to make it happen.",
    "Would be really fun.",
    "Your game, I'm game.",
    "Hopefully the Internet holds out in the stream, doesn't like kick the bucket.",
    "Classic streaming issues.",
    "We can talk about creative shop, actually where we're sitting here like subject, what's the?",
    "What's the plan with?",
    "It was like your vision for this big mouth.",
    "Like what do you do you live in or do you have any thoughts yet?",
    "I don't want to put you on the spot if you're still figuring it out.",
    "And just so everybody knows where to draw the body real quick so the body is just going to be trying to find the right thickness as I kind of want to match everything else I I lines are a little heavy, but I kind of like that.",
    "There are like super heavy characters, got some thick lines.",
    "Little thicker than what I normally draw, but it's all good.",
    "Is all good.",
    "Yeah it is kind of sales.",
    "Let's see where do you get your music for streaming?",
    "So I get my music from.",
    "Artlist dot IO.",
    "Website you can get music for client work to.",
    "From there it's a base fee of $200 for the year, and then you can use the music for whatever you want.",
    "Client work you can you know it's for profit stuff.",
    "All that kind of stuff which is nice.",
    "Adobe.",
    "When you asked is Adobe have copyrights, what do you mean on it depends on what.",
    "All the music I use it it's mine.",
    "You know, like if they do like a promotional thing using sorry, had to blow my nose really quick.",
    "Right now.",
    "Go away.",
    "No, I don't have anything with my hands on, but whenever I watch him before I like.",
    "Handle food now I'm touching the iPad screen, so that defeats the purpose so well.",
    "I'm not going outside anytime soon anyway.",
    "Anyway, back to what I was saying.",
    "Does Adobe have copyrights?",
    "I mean they do like if they do a promotional thing that they did something for me on Behance.",
    "They just took the footage and they didn't use any of my music or anything like that.",
    "They put their own stuff in so I'm sure they have, you know a source where they get their own stuff from but they don't use.",
    "They don't have like don't you like my stuff?",
    "But I do own the rights to the music that you're that you're listening to.",
    "Or have you know as royalty free or whatever the word is for rights usage?",
    "I licensed it, that's why I'm trying to say.",
