    "I think is like a 10.5 but one of the really cool things about using the iPad.",
    "Like just the standard iPad.",
    "It's really cheap model.",
    "I think they go for like anywhere from like 3 to $400.",
    "Which is super rad and you can get one for pretty cheap and it's nice because you have the ability to like not spend a bunch of money and still use awesome software.",
    "Like fresco.",
    "I know there's been some concern in the past about so I'm trying to move some cords out of the way here so I'm comfortable I draw.",
    "Comfort is key I know in the past.",
    "There's been some concerns about like you know doing it in iPad versus iPad pro like?",
    "What's the difference iPad Air?",

    "I've never really had any problems like the live brushes on the iPad work fine.",
    "My iPad right now is a little overloaded because I'm super cheap and I bought like the base model.",
    "It is only 32 gig.",
    "I don't know if that effects.",
    "It 'cause it's almost filled up already so my life brushes can lag.",
    "Sometimes I'm also like really crammed on space.",
    "So that's going to get an upgrade soon but food for thought if you are in the market to get a tablet for drawing.",
    "I recommend the iPad I've had no problems with it.",
    "I really dig it.",
    "Yeah, so anyway, let's get going here.",
    "Cool brush so as you guys all know I like to draw with the basic pencil just to start out and I usually pick a color blue something that kind of works just to create like a blue line.",
    "Before we had that key list from the tongue in the background and then the Orange is kind of the color of the character going to flip that.",
    "Let's go over the iPad.",
    "It started to new graphics, right?",
    "It's kind of nice seeing that stuff again were drawn in Adobe Practical.",
    "I'm using a pre release version 1.6 I think is the number.",
    "Hopefully there's some cool stuff coming from here for all of you and the near future.",
    "Yes, so should be good.",
    "Anyway.",
    "Like I said, well, some more elaborate characters.",
    "One thing I want to know that illustration that I showed there was some gradients, that stuff was applied in illustrator.",
    "I kicked us out of the PDF.",
    "If you're curious is how I do that kind of stuff?",
    "Go back in the replace.",
    "There is an old stream that I did or I showed illustrator and how I take my illustrations from frescoes PDFs.",

    "Let's start the conversation.",
    "Well, we can do here for a character.",
    "Let's see like a big.",
    "Do a circle.",
    "All right, we're going to add some of these things, so for anyone who is new to watching in curious as to what I am using, I'm using the pixel brush in Adobe fresco with the color blue so I can do the rough sketch.",
    "It is the basic.",
    "It's under the sketching features.",
    "If you go to oh wow, there's some new things in here.",
    "'cause I downloaded a new thing anyway, sketching pencil looks like I never use this before, but I use it all the time.",
    "During work today as amazing.",

    "Those kind of helping take care of my daughter today.",
    "This little was really have a whole lot of time to tune in.",
    "I got pretty far through.",
    "I'm like pretty much almost done, but I'm having some like remember when Family Guy became.",
    "Remember when Family Guy became.",
    "The Cleveland show.",
    "I feel like I'm having like flashbacks to that like.",
    "Feels like it's a solid concept, but it feels like it's too close to the universe and even at least like that show.",
    "At least that show was like, you know, based on a character that was in it.",
    "I'm going to give us like a big wonky nose.",
    "Um?",
    "You know, and this show isn't based on characters from Rick and Morty, their new characters in like I guess, a new universe.",
    "I mean, maybe it will be a tie in at some point, but it just doesn't feel like.",
    "I don't know.",
    "I don't know how I'm feeling about it.",
    "I don't wanna do the big nose my Bible that I thought I would.",
    "Yeah, right?",
    "Like so, it's just it feels it feels like it's it should be in the same world like it feels like it should be a Rick and Morty spin off and it's just not and it feels very odd.",
    "And again, I'm not very far through, but like I think what I'm struggling with is so something is very.",
    "Unknown thing with Rick and Morty.",
    "Justin roiland does a lot of voices and in this he does a lot of voices, so the voices I think that's what's really messing me up.",
    "The voices are all the same characters like.",
    "I feel like I.",
    "I feel like I feel like I'm just hearing Rick and Morty characters.",
    "I did laugh a lot to like you just said, so that's the thing.",
    "The show is very funny, like it's not that it's a poorly written show or anything like that.",
    "Like it shows great, like I've no complaints about it.",
    "I think it's awesome.",
    "As far as that goes, I think I just.",
    "I'm having a really hard time buying into the universe like, which sucks because it's a cool show like it's not like the show.",
    "The show is not bad.",
    "I had some good laughs, you know, I love.",
    "I love.",
    "I don't know all the names of the characters yet, but the green, alien, economize feel like a pinky and the brain kind of situation a little bit like there is, you know.",
    "You got like the smart dude and he's like all serious and then you got like this kind of dork, that's like.",
    "More funny and you know, kind of like seeing the bright side, everything very like optimistic.",
    "I love how he had Wolf shirt on at one point, which if you guys don't know who that is, he's like the writer, creator of like.",
    "Law and order and all those kind of shows.",
    "So like I said, You're looking at Adobe fresco is a drawing app for the iPad or surface or whatever tablet you really have it for mobile devices.",
    "There's not a desktop version that's with photo shop is for, but fresco works a whole lot like photo shop.",
    "You can do a lot of fun things, there is pixel brushes.",
    "That work just like Photoshop brushes.",
    "You can import them from this plus sign down here.",
    "You got live brushes which act like oil paints in watercolors.",
    "You can do all sorts of fun things.",
    "Get like a not that you all sorts of fun things like those close splotches that I just made.",
    "And then you also have vector brushes, which is one of my favorite.",
    "We're going to get into that later in the stream, but let's go back to the Pixel Brush.",
    "'cause we gotta do our rough sketch burst.",
    "So we're going here we go sketching.",
    "We're going to grab the pencil or grab the blue.",

    "Kinda cold Turkey like usually I draw at some point today but I've been super busy day.",

    "So I'm coming in at this like like I said earlier and think one more minute just warming up over.",
    "I literally was drawing like quick thumbnails just to loosen up the myths so that I could like make something.",
    "So let's just.",

    "So any ideas for an illustration?",
    "Feel free to shout out.",

    "I think everyone kind of I'm kinda breezing through this.",
    "I think everyone kind of see what's going on here.",
    "I like line, it up nicely.",
    "And actually at first thought, this was kind of annoying but I kind of like it now because I can kind of pick where like?",
    "In a circle the line is going to be thicker so if I.",
    "Remove my selection on that you guys can see here like the thicker line is kind of on the outside.",
    "Wow, now, what I want to do the thicker line is kind of like on the outside here, drawing with white.",
    "We get a color you guys can all see it's kind of on the outside over here.",
    "The reason why do that it's 'cause?",
    "The way that you know the angle of it is, we're looking at him from you know like this side.",
    "So I want that line to be a little thicker closer to the Camera.",
    "So to speak and then the other side will be a little less maybe his eyes kind of rounded and it comes out a little bit in the curvature.",
    "Would make that side thinner?",
    "So again we just repeat the process duplicate.",
    "Phil.",
    "Grab that shrink it up nicely.",
    "Let's buddies kind of shorter so make him look down.",
    "Done.",
    "Looks kind of awkward it's got a little bit of a monkey kind of like lazy.",

    "And cool spend a lot of time on this.",
    "I really care about it.",
    "Birches together good nice vector layer if you hold down this little guy talking this whole time, too few.",
    "Take a little widget here and you hold it down group.",
    "And you grab your paint bucket, you tap.",
    "It'll remove attacks is like a like a big eraser and it's just kind of like a It's like you selected a shape and then hit delete an illustrator.",
    "Just kind of gets rid of that area.",
    "And let's duplicate save on time always duplicate size little bigger closer to us.",
    "Let's see here sorry got 2 things going now to pens.",
    "He's my tablet to control my computer an I use my.",

    "I've started using red line to to like add in detail, which has been really cool and you know.",
    "Um.",
    "Yeah, I don't know like it's just a new technique that I started adding adding into this so it will start drawing.",
    "I actually brought with me.",
    "Today this giant skateboard deck.",
    "I'm sure you're wondering why I'm bringing this up.",
    "I always wanted to paint my own deck and I think I'm actually going to digital illustration.",
    "I think it just hit the mic with it, so I'm sorry if you heard that.",
    "I've always wanted to do digital illustration on escape deck so I'm considering doing that.",
    "And I've tried in the past with some prints and done vinyl like for instance.",
    "Stuff like that.",
    "And it was kind of cool and sort of work, but not so well so I bought this blank deck off Amazon for like $10.",
    "They said it was a true blanket came to me orange, so I have to sand it down and it says runner on it if you guys could see that down here.",
    "For the trucks go so I'm going to say it all that off so that I have a nice blank thing, but I want to create a drawing that I can use.",
    "To create a digital print out of and put on the board.",
    "I don't know how to do that, yet.",
    "I will post that project, though, in my Behance page under my projects you can go check that out.",
    "You can see my process.",
    "I'll post photos and stuff like that there and do a whole entire Gallery.",
    "So you can really see the full work but.",
    "It's going to start right here tonight on this little 4K canvas, which I believe is like 4000 by 4000 or 40.",
    "4060 Bucks or something weird like that in Frisco and it's just a big square.",
    "I'm going to draw with Vector.",
    "I don't tend to do any kind of.",
    "I don't know I intend to do anything crazy.",
    "I'm going to be just doing some vector work 'cause.",
    "I think the way I'm going to the board when it's all done is sorry.",
    "I'm trying to close some stuff out here on my computer.",
    "The way I'm going to the board is I'm going to make this thing I'm going to print it out on a vinyl machine cut the vinyl and then use that as a stencil to paint over.",
    "So I get really nice clean lines.",
    "Um.",
    "So I'm just going to be working in vector so I could have probably worked on a smaller canvas.",
    "You know what let's shrink it down so let's go over here, yeah, there, we go 4096.",
    "In 96, I'm not working with pixel images.",
    "I don't need such a large canvas.",
    "So when we shrink this down so let's just tap in here.",
    "Let's pick, like the 2100 by twenty one hundred an will hit OK.",
    "And there, we go got a small canvas smaller canvas.",
    "So it's a little lighter weight easier to move around.",
    "Those are things that note as artists like definitely try to remember what you guys are going to be.",
    "Doing if you're going to print your probably wanna make something larger and use like 300 DPI where if you're doing digital.",
    "Some of the smaller 72.",
    "DPI specially if you're working in vector you can work really kind of small.",
    "You know it makes it a lot easier.",
    "So let's grab our brush.",
    "Let's start something here.",
    "I don't really know what to draw.",
    "Don't know at least it start out kind of making something here circles always start with circles and it will be like a?",

    "Kind of makes stuff up as I go.",
    "I'll be honest since I gave myself a project now the skateboard thing that I just showed.",
    "I'm like thinking now, I had on my car wait?",
    "How does this play does this work in this medium and?",
    "Will work on the deck so?",
    "I don't know maybe just like myself out let's do like A.",

    "Commander Adobe draw Oh boy OK here, we go.",
    "Now this turned out way easier than I thought.",
    "Yeah, I did this face a while back and I really liked it by the way something really cool about fresco that I should point out.",
    "The way that I'm pulling this off right now.",
    "Um.",
    "Fresco this is my E drawing for 36 days of type fresco or one of the cool thing about Adobe in general is because we have the?",
    "Creative cloud a lot of these drawings and stuff like that actually got imported from the old drawing apps.",
    "Via the creative cloud, which is really cool Boo.",
    "Sorry I dropped enough Bob did cars there.",
    "And Yeah, it's really cool like you know that's the.",
    "Like I don't know it's exciting like I got super pumped about that 'cause you make all these drawings and I want to switch it over to France go to work.",
    "Professionally and yeah, it's one of the things that's just super awesome that, like I was able to explain myself because I.",
    "so I thought that was really funny that he had a shirt on that just like said that.",
    "Oh, fun bucket was great.",
    "Like that's the other thing like the Rick and Morty humor is there big time again.",
    "The biggest thing I'm struggling with is the universe like.",
    "There are shows that have done it in the past.",
    "Well, I I hate I hate comparing like American Dad Family Guy comes in my opinion there are two totally different shows, but that's just it.",
    "There are two different shows, same thing with like, Futurama, disenchanted and The Simpsons all the same creator, same crew but.",
    "Different shelves, you know.",
    "Pendleton Ward with Adventure Time in his new series on Netflix, the Midnight Gospel very, very different shows.",
    "I mean they couldn't be more opposite, same, creator, same kind of style, but they feel they feel different even though they got like similar looks.",
    "Solar opposites in Rick and Morty.",
    "Pretty sure they're the same.",
    "The same, the same world.",
    "So we'll see how it fares.",
    "Like I said, You know, first happen not even valid yet.",
    "So I am excited to see where it goes.",
    "I do like the characters.",
    "I did laugh so it should be cool.",
    "You know, I'm pumped to finish it now.",
    "With all that said, I will say I did watch a very awesome piece of Classic Cinema last night which was blood sport with.",
    "What is his name?",
    "Oh my gosh, I'm blanking hard well.",
    "The muscular dude from the 80s.",
    "He's up there with like Sylvester Stallone and the other guy Arnold, but it wasn't those too.",
    "Than almost said Rob Van Dam, but that's a wrestler.",
    "But name is kind of similar I think.",
    "He watched Bloodsport recently.",
    "Remind me with the actors name is that was in it.",
    "Now I gotta look it up.",
    "OK, hold on.",
    "Let's open a web browser away to somebody message me who was John Claude Van Dam that was it?",
    "Dropping my gosh.",
    "You know the worst part about that movie blood sport is that.",
    "That The scene where they do all the flashbacks with the kids in the house growing up when they try to steal the like Cortana.",
    "I don't know, so like obviously Jean-Claude Van Damme has like like an accent.",
    "And for some reason the kid they picked tried to replicate that accent as a kid, but instead ended up just sound he sounded like an Adam Sandler character like I'm expecting that I was.",
    "I really expect him to buy copper do.",
    "Particularly.",
    "This is so weird.",
    "It was the weirdest part of the movie.",
    "And then they kept cutting back like they could have just done like a quick flash to him trying to fill a sword and then like run through a montage of that kids life and cut back and it would have made perfect sense.",
    "But instead they kept prolonging the scene.",
    "It was so awkward.",
    "Anyway, great movie, though excellent, like, I'm highly highly recommend you never seen Bloodsport Give it a watch.",
    "You know?",
    "Not too gory.",
    "It's not to like aggressive, it's fun.",
    "Good classic piece of 80 cinema.",
    "So what are your favorite 80s films?",
    "I feel like I asked this question all the time, but I love 80s movies.",
    "I consider it like the Golden era of film for being totally honest.",

    "I was like I'm gonna watch some of this 'cause I kind of started.",
    "My setup usually start setting up machines like 20 minutes before but I wanted to add a scene to showcase some of the art to kind of show what kind of style and kind of going to kind of drawn tonight and I saw your stream.",

    "'cause then I realized it looks like a war frame costume from that game and I kind of that turned me off a little bit.",
    "I had a lot of mixed emotions about this.",
    "I think it depends on who I'm talking too, like if someone in the chat right now is like I love the new PlayStation, I'll be like, you know what I love it too.",
    "Like 'cause I want to like it.",
    "'cause I like PlayStation alive.",
    "That's my childhood system.",

    "I gotta hear.",
    "This tongue is oppressive.",
    "Like I'm starting to notice whenever I draw, like really overtly large tongues like this.",
    "That they kind of get in the way of where the legs connect, and it doesn't give us like a visual idea of.",
    "Where these things go?",
    "The problem having me this person flows.",
    "There's like a floating character, like a geodude thing.",

    "It was so funny they were like yeah like you watch Pok\u00e9mon on my Kelly.",
    "You know I start talking about it and they go.",
    "Yeah OK.",
    "I don't watch Pok\u00e9mon so really think about it.",
    "But here's what I want.",
    "That's kind of like Pok\u00e9mon 'cause they were getting the direction from somebody else on their team.",
    "It was so funny nothing OK.",
    "PC Master race cheddar UPC fan then I'm assuming you are obviously.",
    "I should mention 2 for this stream, so if you knew the stream First off welcome, please say hello in the chat.",
    "Check out the links below down in the description as a whole bunch of fun stuff.",
    "There you can join the discord.",
    "We have a lot of fun conversation, so if you like once you watch here, you want to keep the conversation going.",
    "That's where it's happening.",
    "Plus all sorts of fun things in there.",
    "I gotta get better about posting more.",
    "There is a Spotify playlist coming soon.",
    "Hopefully this week I have intentions to put that together.",
    "Everyone's been asking me to do that with the music that I have here in my stream and what else?",
    "What else what else?",
    "What else?",
    "Uh oh joy.",
    "Follow my Instagram account Duhat eat fresh cake and check my website youfreshly.com.",
    "Alright, I this is like some rough sketching lines, but it looks like this character's got a beard, so we're going to kind of just scribble that in.",
    "This tongue is way too big.",
    "I'm not feeling it.",
    "I want a smaller want this character of small time.",
    "Usually fresh cake characters have like these enormously large grotesque.",
    "Tongues, but I think tonight we're going to.",
    "We're going to change that up because I don't know why.",
    "'cause I feel like it, that's why.",
    "Mother.",
    "Beard style script laughing in.",
    "Right, so then the blue is going to be where, like all the little kind of there's some like.",
    "I guess it'll be some black ink that kind of shootout.",
    "It's kind of a bummer 'cause when I stretched it out, I'm realizing now that I lost all that detail underneath which really made it.",
    "So we're going to add a lot of that in.",
    "So that's going to kind of all go in here.",
    "So it's actually get something different.",
    "Let's get the red, but we use the red to kind of rough in where where the ink is going to go.",
    "And this could be a fun one, like watching my earlier streams from the week.",
    "I I was doing some kind of like I don't know.",
    "I'll call it soda pop, but like do effects and working with transparencies so.",
    "It could be something cool to integrate here.",
    "Take something I learned from last week streams.",
    "Bring it into this stream.",
    "Make something really cool and unique, again with some things that I learned.",
    "You know, that's kind of this whole process.",
    "This creative process.",
    "Also really pretentious when I talk about like the process.",
    "But I gotta ask that question once in an interview.",
    "Somebody was, like you told me about your process and I was and it's funny.",
    "'cause like I know as creators we all have.",
    "I know we all have our process if you will, but like I never really had to explain it to anyone before that moment and I sounded like the biggest loser.",
    "I was just there like tells about your process when you know you're doing things like well, let me tell you what I do.",
    "So I go on the Internet and look at it for awhile and then I yeah, I just kind of think about it.",
    "Maybe draw a little just like wow, I really.",
    "It's not like I had some like.",
    "Crazy thing that I was going to go into depth with like.",
    "OK, well first it has to be at least 54 degrees out at 9:00 AM and I spent around three times in the front yard before I drink my coffee.",
    "Then like yeah, I don't know what I'm supposed to say like I just think about stuff and then it happens.",
    "Not a fan of octopi.",
    "Is that a real portal?",
    "I don't know fermenter Sam.",
    "I'll be honest.",
    "I thought you were talking about pies to have like chemicals in it.",
    "That should be gross.",
    "We're doing a meat pie.",
    "We pause are delicious.",
    "Let's you watch will be taught in their home.",
    "Alright, so I'll make some like I don't know cloud kind of junk.",
    "And it'll probably taper off down here, so will just kind of rough sketch that in I'll figure it out later.",
    "I think it occupies the real plural.",
    "I don't think they're like geese, you know so well.",
    "Wait no moose, yeah sheep you don't say sheeps.",
    "So so they would be like I don't know, I'm just blabbing at this point.",
    "I'm going to tune in and be like what the hell is This guy talking about?",
    "Geese and goose and.",
    "Mason moose Is united there?",
    "All right?",
    "I feel like because I didn't start this one from the ground up right out of the gate.",
    "Um?",
    "I couldn't even see the octopi.",
    "Oh well.",
    "We have to work on that.",
    "I'm not good.",
    "No, I'm sure you'll see once colors added and everything else.",
    "Will get there, will get there.",
    "Uh.",
    "Sam, I don't know what kind of range just went on like that company for a minute.",
    "Huh?",
    "All right?",
    "So here, let's grab black.",
    "Let's just put in some vector lines, don't work.",
    "Alright, So what do I want to start I don't know.",
    "Let's see we are working with.",
    "A again, the canvas size is 3600 by 1200, so we grab our our black vector brush.",
    "Really quick for anyone who's new to Frisco.",
    "There are three brush sets.",
    "There's a pixel brush.",
    "A lot of you returning viewers already know this stuff.",
    "There's a pixel brush which I used to do the rough lines.",
    "Then there's alive brush.",
    "We're not going to use that tonight, but it acts like watercolors and stuff.",
    "Oh woops, it would help if I had like the watercolor brush picked.",
    "Not, oh, I did have the watercolor brush picked.",
    "That's crazy.",
    "Back like watercolors, really fun.",
    "I'm going to be using the back of Russian tonight for this one, so I'm going to dock that little guy down there.",
    "Finger point.",
    "Guys got purpose.",
    "Meet you over there.",
    "What about some Donuts?",
    "Otherwise, like from Brooklyn, Brooklyn, Italian?",
    "An urban Italian Donut man that we have here.",
    "The leg in bag.",
    "Got that the fresh cake strut.",
    "'cause I call it.",
    "Been deemed.",
    "Wild little things sour.",
    "OK, cool name like that.",
    "So Anthony, what kind of music does your band play since your woodshedding?",
    "So that means it's awesome.",
    "The Fresh Strut fresh drive dollar shot.",
    "It wasn't like I don't know some details of this as we go to maybe will put some like.",
    "I don't know figure it out.",
    "It was a little dots on the ground or something.",
    "Which setting is musician geek speak for practicing and private?",
    "Do that is.",
    "Then I would shut all the time, like 'cause I play guitar.",
    "And I only do it in private 'cause I have no one to jam with so.",
    "Alright, let's grab black.",
    "Went over 2 hour vector brush.",
    "The Rolling Stones Rolling Stones tribute band.",
    "That's awesome I love that.",
    "Like the sounds.",
    "Alright, let's see here.",
    "Going to head over to our vector brush, start putting some ink on here.",
    "We are only 20 minutes into the stream flower moving so quick 'cause I'm excited to be back.",
    "Donut holes on the ground.",
    "Yeah, we're gonna put will put some stuff so I think yes, we're going to do.",
    "Alright, let's uh.",
    "First link on this thing is over the eyes, certainly isolated, sort of our shape tool.",
    "Now let's actually look which is there anyone knew that was watching that is not familiar with Adobe fresco?",
    "If so, please say hello in the chat.",
    "I will go through all of the tools for you in fine detail if you want.",
    "It'll be really boring for everybody else, but it would be good for you so you don't have to speak up.",
    "I put no motivation that just now Mike hey, listen if your new don't be shy.",
    "Let's just bore everyone together.",
    "So I have no problem going through all the all the tips and tricks of Adobe fresco.",
    "I'm currently using a shape tool to create the Eyeballs, and here's how I use that tool.",
    "So I selected the circle going to line it up with my rough sketch.",
    "We're going to fill it in and make it a vector, then going to duplicate.",
    "Where to hide the bottom layer and the reason why we do this 'cause we're going to use this to kind of create a little like.",
    "Well, line action for the eyeballs to kind of giving some definition.",
    "So erase we're gonna have our layer selected runner race go down here.",
    "Turn on our other layer and then we're just going to kind of line this up.",
    "Maybe make the line closest to us so the characters of three quarter turn kind of turned towards us going to use that to create a thicker line on that side are ACI.",
    "And then let's grab our pink bucket.",
    "Let's grab our white, fill it in.",
    "Let's grab this without any, grab our transform work support.",
    "Boom, boom, boom.",
    "Done.",
    "And that's a kind of create that little bit of definition.",
    "So the I feel like it's a little bit something back in the head.",
    "Let's you know, let's do something else.",
    "I think you feel like its eyeballs really set back in the donut brain.",
    "We're going to do is we're going to grab black or Gray bar vector brush.",
    "We're just going to kind of put weight on the wrong layer.",
    "Oh, that's a shaky line.",
    "Why is that a shaky line?",
    "Because I did not set my smoothing up very high.",
    "It will recognize and it will make a new vector layer for you so you know something something kind of cool.",
    "Let's think about why you working kind of just kind of jump in and do your thing and we start with here.",
    "Who?",
    "Should probably turn on pressure dynamics and I should turn this down so I I am working with a square canvas here.",
    "I think it's.",
    "Solution settings 4096 by 4096, so it's pretty big.",
    "I believe fresco labels as 4K.",
    "Is a 4K Square and rightfully so that's really nice.",
    "If you're working with pixel brushes a lot and you need a really large canvas 'cause you don't want to have to go back and re draw anything 'cause.",
    "If you scale up a pixel.",
    "It's not a vector.",
    "It doesn't scale infinitely which is a big pain in the butt.",
    "Uh.",
    "You know it's a good price size to work with that I do work with vectors a lot, so.",
    "Kind of weird that I'm working with canvas that big so I really don't need to.",
    "But it's all good.",
    "True so let's see here.",
    "Let's do that.",
    "Let's make it I.",
    "So for anyone curious is what I'm doing that's new.",
    "I'm using the selection tool to create a circle to create a nice perfect eyeball.",
    "Uh.",
    "Unlike Adobe draw fresco does not have a shape tool.",
    "I've talked about this in the past and previous streams.",
    "You can go through and watch.",
    "I do some really in depth like.",
    "You know.",
    "Walkthrough how I do this process.",
    "To make like really nice circles, you can go watch.",
    "Those it's pretty much what I'm doing right now.",
    "But yeah, until they add a function like they had an Adobe draw or sketch where they have like a little shape tool you could pick some cool stuff.",
    "This is kind of how you gotta do it.",
    "Unfortunately, or at least the way that I found to do a best.",
    "And let's see here another one.",
    "People.",
    "Skip and there, we go that's an animal.",
    "So I hope everybody had a nice holiday.",
    "Maybe everybody got some time off definitely excited to be back like I was saying at the beginning of the stream.",
    "Kind of between Christmas and New Years and everything and visiting family have not been streaming as much as I wanted to, but I'm back going to be streaming a whole lot more.",
    "Hoping to bring some new short form content to everybody so you have to sit there and watch.",
    "These like longwinded streams.",
    "You can start watching some short content.",
    "That's maybe a little bit more engaging and fun.",
    "So definitely follow me and stay tuned for that kind of stuff that will be coming out.",
    "Hopefully soon who Bing I get some stuff up by the end of the month.",
    "But you know.",
    "The shorter streams take a little bit more time and.",
    "Such as so I kind of Willy Nilly, like to actually like put some thought instruction behind it, so you actually learn something.",
    "If there's anything anyone's ever interested in learning.",
    "Do drop me a message man here on Behance like.",
    "I respond people all the time.",
    "You know if anyone is watching right now that's message me in the past.",
    "But if anyone is they can probably contest too.",
    "That's hit me up before they can definitely contest that I do respond.",
    "I'm a real person.",
    "You know, I like to reply and I like having conversations.",
    "Right so let's try to do this like full want to do this.",
    "I'm doing this backwards, let's hide that layer real quick.",
    "The first is mouth.",
    "Emma teeth are half circles.",
    "Who?",
    "I should mention this, I was do the Top row 1st.",
    "'Cause then my guys all get overbites and instead of Underbites.",
    "I like that better for some reason.",
    "Character number.",
    "Sometimes you just get so stuck in like a flow like your own process.",
    "That.",
    "So anyone that's watching and TuneIn If you got any questions.",
    "Feel free to ask, don't be shy.",
    "I'm here to help.",
    "Definitely want people to start to learn the different types of softwares.",
    "Frescoes not just 'cause it's the one that I like to use the most it's not the only one I use.",
    "So let's put this T shirt in here.",
    "Cool and again we just very much not concerned actually anything.",
    "I'm not concerned at all about this 'cause when I fill in this guy behind or in front of him.",
    "This shirt line, you're seeing over here is going to disappear.",
    "So we're actually going to leave that 'cause I want to keep that there for when I.",
    "Duplicate this an end up scaling everything up.",
    "So yeah, I see some new people are tuning in.",
    "If you have any questions or want to know what I'm using?",
    "Or just want to talk shop.",
    "Feel free.",
    "You know more than happy to answer any questions.",
    "Let's go to skeletal crux of his arm.",
    "Or you know, we can just talk about art or like I said earlier we can have anything video games.",
    "Is anyone out there playing any awesome video games?",
    "Let me know what they are 'cause I'm about to finish Borderlands and I would love.",
    "Suggestions.",
    "I was going to start Neo 'cause, it was free I've PlayStation 4.",
    "And.",
    "It was the free game of the month last month.",
    "Slightly considering getting an Xbox to get game pass.",
    "Don't know yet.",
    "Down for suggestions.",
    "It's going to muscle T on sort of.",
    "Well, you know, I don't like it.",
    "These guys some Arm Cruxes, I don't know what those are called.",
    "These 2 need to be more exaggerated.",
    "Oh, I feel like my music keeps cutting off what is going on?",
    "Let's see here.",
    "Hope you know, I don't have it looked OK.",
    "Sorry that the music kept cutting out on everybody.",
    "I'm sorry, there might have been some dead air there.",
    "I.",
    "Had that kind of rebuild my stream set up 'cause I got a new desk if any of you.",
    "You know.",
    "Donna or have watched my old streams before.",
    "You know that I was working on this like really tight sort of kind of smaller desk.",
    "Can I recently bought like a nice?",
    "Big nicer one.",
    "This is going on.",
    "I think this guy should have some like chromie kind of whis peas in the front.",
    "Don't know what's going on with him.",
    "Certainly.",
    "In some rough days.",
    "Her front.",
    "Both these guys man they have, like, horrible haircuts.",
    "I don't know what's going on.",
    "Whatever universe these guys exist in a Barber is needed so if you want to make a quick 6 figures.",
    "Think that this would be the.",
    "The town.",
    "See here.",
    "Sorry folks I know I keep switching it's 'cause like I said, I had the dual setup.",
    "I have my computer here.",
    "Then I got my webcam here to talk to all of you and I got my iPad down here.",
    "So every so often, I feel like I'm like looking everywhere.",
    "Let's see you know what let's lose this like weird belly line that I put on this guy down here.",
    "This is just looking like.",
    "Garbage.",
    "True.",
    "We can do better.",
    "We can rebuild him.",
    "There we go.",
    "Cool so we got like 2 Tubby Dad Bods, just cruising through town, they're doing their thing.",
    "Like I said, I drew these on different layers on purpose because I want to.",
    "One of the utilized both them as individual characters and.",
    "Scale them up so I can put like copy and stuff.",
    "I'm just going to put this line here just to close that gap now.",
    "I know it looks terrible right now don't worry the Magic's about to happen.",
    "So we're going to move this layer.",
    "Up into here.",
    "I'm going to go here.",
    "Let's duplicate this.",
    "The reason for that, like I said if you watch my streams.",
    "In the past, you know, I don't like to be destructive.",
    "Or I could be as.",
    "Least destructive as possible, the reason for that is because if this was like a client project and a client came back and they were like.",
    "We love what you did, but we really hate like that.",
    "Let's grab a new layer.",
    "Let's let's do a red line like I was talking about let's let's kind of.",
    "Let's refine this, a little further.",
    "No, she doesn't have a nose, but I don't mind that.",
    "What are your thoughts?",
    "Let me know should he have a nose or not.",
    "Or as much space put a nose and I ask that question was going to get nose into my car.",
    "I think I like Ray, something to figure it out.",
    "So again I started doing this to kind of help myself This looks weird right now.",
    "But just to help myself kind of clean up my blue line sketches because.",
    "They're starting to get a little wild and like I'm starting to like too much.",
    "Cinnamon then I as I'm drawing.",
    "I start to lose my place of like.",
    "I don't know.",
    "What is that I was going to make?",
    "I found it really helpful recently and I can shoot I could show you guys, some of this stuff actually.",
    "Uh.",
    "Hesitated for a second accident if I want to give it away.",
    "Internet show everybody this stuff a little bit.",
    "I started doing some, like you know animation frames and trying to figure out how to use fresco in a way to create.",
    "It doesn't have like a like a timeline tool like photo shop, which I kind of wish it did.",
    "Hum.",
    "But I want to show everybody like you know started doing this technique because I started doing some animating it was.",
    "Easier to draw quickly with the blue and then kind of go in and clean up obviously to get like a more.",
    "Refined animation.",
    "So this tooth.",
    "And then this comes here in this comes over.",
    "This whole area is filled.",
    "This I'm talking about now I can like kind of going to get a better idea of.",
    "What it is I was going to do for that that cheek there?",
    "But that little like kind of lip.",
    "Same thing for in here like maybe that connects.",
    "Soon, as this so we leave that little space.",

    "Anyone is curious there's a whole ton of new artists that are starting to pop up on here, so you guys definitely you know.",
    "Start checking it out start following other people.",
    "You know given like their content support the arts man.",
    "It's super key and if you guys keep supporting us.",
    "Will keep bringing you awesome content to watch.",
    "So you know, kind of got a nice little thing going on.",
    "Yeah, there's just a lot of good people out there right now that are making some really awesome work.",

    "Build on the community that was already here in Behance.",
    "Right and there, we go.",
    "We will have some like.",
    "Stray hairs obviously.",
    "I think a lot of people know my techniques at this point like this hair is going to look like that is going to be filled in with one.",
    "Solid color.",
    "Not that I need to do this 'cause I know that, but it helps.",
    "Alexis I know.",

    "So just to give anyone who's tuning in Anna little late, an idea of what we're going to be drawn.",
    "I'm gonna hop on over.",
    "We're going to make something that looks kind of like this character, right?",
    "Wait right here.",
    "There we go character right next to me.",
    "Right now I'm going to be using the same kind of color palette.",
    "All that kind of stuff, so that's kind of where we're headed.",

    "Like Something like this?",
    "No, the same walking pose for a bit.",
    "I should change that up.",
    "God, you know.",
    "Expand, expand the art so again, there's like some flora and stuff like that kind of going on in these things.",
    "So I'm just going to have rough sketch that stuff in really quick.",
    "Is he brave heart?",
    "Until fairly recently actually think it was under the background files and he got stuck in so we went to someone's house with just paint.",
    "Let's let's get this story out there.",
    "You went to someones house like they haven't party or like a get together or was it just like someone's like hey Jack, I'm assuming like forever you want to come over and hang out and you're like sure.",
    "And then Braveheart was on and you're like What is this movie and they're like it's very hard and you were like OK and then like 2 hours past.",

    "I try.",
    "Oh what's up Amanda?",
    "How are you happy?",
    "Saturday slash Sunday.",
    "Just so everybody knows if you are watching the stream right now and you made me feel like you're a little bit behind, check out the live button.",
    "It's down in the bottom left.",
    "Everyone go scrub over your play head right now.",
    "Give it a second by the live button is Gray probably if you're behind or it's right if you're caught up, click it.",
    "It'll take you right to the live section of the stream, so give me a second.",
    "Is that like button bottom left?",
    "OK cool well caught up yeah.",
    "And if you feel like you missed something at all in the stream, all good.",
    "Guess what you can either scrub back or.",
    "You can get your place recall.",
    "Scott, listen tedious.",
    "That would be best, yeah?",
    "We will do something and I hold on.",
    "Bad boy.",
    "I don't know.",
    "I kinda like it is like looking at you like.",
    "How do we can treating everybody awesome man?",
    "I have a very good weekend.",
    "Oh, you'll appreciate this.",
    "I found this site called trade coffee or trade drink trade coffee, coffee, drink, coffee, trade.com, something like that.",
    "Something about trading coffee.",
    "Regardless, you like you sign up and you put in.",
    "What kind of coffee do you like?",
    "And then they ship different bags view.",
    "So I think we'll try it out.",
    "OK, we're going to start adding in some vector lines so.",
    "Going to head over to the vector brush weather going on.",
    "Taking a poll was everyone's favorite fresh cake character who I like that how.",
    "That's a good question.",
    "What is everyone's favorite friend character here?",
    "Let's go back like.",
    "Here are some of the many characters in fresh cake.",
    "Let's go file documents.",
    "Here are just a few.",
    "This isn't even remotely close to all the different characters, but here are some of the different ones that have ended up on a stream.",
    "Not this thing this my daughter made 'cause No I don't know who made that.",
    "Oh actually I do know what that is.",
    "Weirdly suggested, going to get out of there.",
    "That was, uh, as it was in the drawing challenge where you want to friend, somebody draws on your back and then you have to draw what they're drawing under back.",
    "Without seeing that wasn't my wife and I were doing with that.",
    "Here this is my daughters art.",
    "My 7 month old who stole my pen so I just held the iPad like this so trying to catch it.",
    "Alright, let's go back to the drawing.",
    "I mean the donor obviously.",
    "Yeah, I mean that was awesome.",
    "I think my favorite character so far has been this cheesecake person, by the way.",
    "This is finished cheesecake drawing from the other night.",
    "I realized it really posted 'cause I was adding gradients and stuff and I'm doing like a whole spread.",
    "This is what the character was all done.",
    "Sherry whip was her name.",
    "Loneliness character too.",
    "Delivery coffee sounds good at right.",
    "Still trying to figure out.",
    "Like this to her or not.",
    "So tempted to go fix E long.",
    "Hi.",
    "We're going to go back where to go with the vector brush facing round and set the setting pressure dynamic velocity dynamic on fresh dynamic is set to 100%.",
    "Velocity dynamic is set to 40 an you can draw and figure out your line looks like up in that box.",
    "If you really want set the smoothing up to.",
    "Let's start with the big hand.",
    "Because, you know?",
    "Excuse me Alright, so going to set our brush to want to set it to like 8 'cause it's a little bit of a smaller canvas as far as the height goes then I usually use so it down like 8.",
    "Set our smoothing up to somewhere in the 80s and they would have pressure dynamic set to 100% and we were going to have velocity dynamic set to.",
    "Or do you percent?",
    "Oh, you said, how do you get motivated?",
    "You gave like a human answer?",
    "Yeah, OK, I see what you're saying.",
    "Yeah, I know I gave a real human answer.",
    "But like seriously, like my processes like I drink coffee in the morning and then I just kind of start drawing.",
    "I guess like I wanna bump this up actually a little bit back tonight.",
    "I guess part of my process is watching cartoons in the morning like I do watch a great deal currently today.",
    "Well for starters.",
    "I recently signed up for HBO Max 'cause they got some really cool content on there and I started watching a cartoon this morning called summer camp.",
    "Now yeah, summer camp island.",
    "Oh my God it's like the cutest show I've ever seen.",
    "Everyone seems so friendly in it and very excited to watch more of it.",
    "And also we feel Max's Big Bang Theory, which I love that show so very excited to like watch it from start to finish.",
    "So we start with the tentacles.",
    "No crazy mouse tonight none of that stuff going to focus a lot on like the big folds that are pretty much kind of synonymous with fresh cake illustrations.",
    "Uh.",
    "And all that kind of good stuff.",
    "So Sam, how you look in the 90s?",
    "You're 90 sneakers.",
    "They're very 90s looking dude where they nikes.",
    "I think this would have.",
    "All right?",
    "Something I don't like about how I cut this off is that like bottom technical is just going to be like nonexistent, but that's OK.",
    "Right, so again, we are creating a like ultrawide kind of illustration.",
    "I'd put some suction cups on the octopus, but.",
    "Uh.",
    "Or the octopi?",
    "What do we decided it's just?",
    "It's only one, so it's not plural, right?",
    "Max also has.",
    "Yeah they have Adventure Time distant lands.",
    "The bimo episodes I saw that on there went to watch it.",
    "You know I never actually finished Adventure Time I fell out of it when when the creator kind of moved off and went into just storyboarding.",
    "I thought the 1st and 2nd season were incredible and then I just kind of started to lose focus with it and then yeah, when he decided to lose his name.",
    "Pendleton Ward when Pendleton decided to kind of bow out for a hot 2nd take a backseat with things which can't blame him, you know?",
    "Uh, that stuff get stressful?",
    "Aside from doing illustration, I work quite a bit in broadcast TV and it is not easy to say the least, and so yeah, I guess he took a backseat and started kind of just focusing on doing some writing and storyboarding for the show and.",
    "When I finally kind of started to fall off a little bit, but I will say I feel like the show really.",
    "I feel like Adventure Time really, really kind of set the stage for a lot of cartoon networks like future programming, which which is awesome.",
    "Because a lot of shows I feel like kind of mirror that like I I do feel a little bit like.",
    "I feel like I can see hints of it in stuff like summer camp island.",
    "So there are you big like cartoon fan.",
    "I should say are you a big cartoon fan too?",
    "Because I love my cartoons.",
    "Like, really like reality TV an you know live action shows.",
    "Take him or leave him.",
    "If it doesn't have colors screaming in my face.",
    "It's whatever.",
    "Like not that into it.",
    "Are you love cartoons?",
    "Oh my God, that's awesome.",
    "I said my smoothing somewhere between 80 and 90.",
    "It's the.",
    "It's just a happy spot for me with my work is where I feel most comfortable.",
    "You can pump it up to 100 and get a really super crazy smooth line, but there's a little bit of lag with that, FYI so.",
    "Be cautious how you set your smoothing.",
    "Guess you can always get what you want God like what you did there.",
    "Well, that starts in The Rolling Stones, but I'm not I can't think.",
    "Says he is pretty play the base.",
    "What type of base do you have?",
    "An awesome one.",
    "'cause I own a base.",
    "I own a Fender Jazz.",
    "I have not played it in quite awhile so I can't really call myself a bass player, but I used to fly quite a bit.",
    "I really enjoyed it.",
    "And I was in a band We want to cover band though we tried to write our own stuff we did.",
    "Covers were like a pop punk band name was in two no three wow I think about it.",
    "I wasn't 3 bands.",
    "At one point in my life.",
    "First band was called.",
    "Just add water that was like.",
    "Middle school high school so I don't know if that really counts.",
    "We never really.",
    "We didn't play many shows except the talent show we brought that talent show so hard.",
    "Um?",
    "Yeah, it would be cool Sam if any and now got together and then play Dan then you guys had a really cool band.",
    "And then I could go watch.",
    "Anyway, back to my band days, let's see I.",
    "Gotta set my brush smaller.",
    "Yeah I was in just add water there wasn't another band called falling short that was probably the most successful one and then we actually played shows.",
    "I even got to play the track and arrow in Philadelphia.",
    "So if anyone out there is from Philly and you know of the truck.",
    "Hats off to you.",
    "If you don't know what the track is, it's pretty awesome.",
    "It's a oil used to be an old burlesque house in Chinatown in Philadelphia that got turned into a concert venue and there was threatened to shut down, but I think it's still open now, but super cool venue and they redid the ceiling, which is a shame because the ceilings have old plaster in it from like the olden days.",
    "You know it's like 1764 anyway, whatever and they had this giant net that spanned across the ceiling to catch the plaster when it fell.",
    "When people would rock out, but then I think they redid it finally 'cause that was like, you know, asbestos was an issue.",
    "Who precision bass?",
    "It's awesome.",
    "But a lot of detail in that I'm all right now.",
    "That's OK.",
    "Let's duplicate.",
    "Grab here, move this eyeball over let's shrink it down and we're going to lose a couple of things and to lose those two things I want to grab this little table here, which takes a brush you're using and converts it into an eraser.",
    "Going to drag down and I'm just going to really quick.",
    "Because we get this blue line and use it to quickly erase.",
    "Those are that line work that I did.",
    "We create a new layer underneath were going to grab our vector brush again.",
    "Make sure we haven't selected and we're just going to draw in our other brow.",
    "So very easy to make eyes the fresh cake way.",
    "We got a lot of musicians that watch this stream, which is awesome.",
    "do I like cater to the.",
    "To the music group.",
    "I feel like now I gotta start making better Music Choice is just kind of like a random playlist that goes.",
    "With some sweet, low fat, no, actually.",
    "I'm going with plan right now.",
    "It's like electronic and lo fi jams and some like hip-hop stuff.",
    "Big eyeball I think.",
    "I like having these eyes have the frosting.",
    "Will maybe kind of it.",
    "Will act as like a way to make it look like it's like hip into the crossing.",
    "Oh, it's up to you how you doing?",
    "Welcome to the stream.",
    "Like I saying, that is like.",
    "Everybody could be a big, warm fresh cake.",
    "Welcome for jumping in and saying hi.",
    "What is going on?",
    "How are you?",
    "Back Defective Donut man at hand here.",
    "What's up with those I layers right now, separate cases aside to update something 'cause I feel like this.",
    "I over here is definitely jutting out a lot further than it done.",
    "It will adjust the system just a few things, but that's a little bit.",
    "Here the paintbrush.",
    "Yeah, we're just going to kind of, so I'm I brush set.",
    "This is a 2100 by 2100 canvas.",
    "I draw with vector lines, so the size of the campus is really matter 'cause.",
    "This character has eyeballs I don't wanna have to redraw an entire character just to.",
    "Make him not have eyeballs so having things in different layers and keeping that kind of like master build.",
    "Is always good as a copy because then you can step into it at any point an you know?",
    "Make quick corrections without needing to do too much damage to the whole entire piece.",
    "Another good reason for that, like on this is.",
    "Later, when I pull this character out and do like the close up shot of his face and I want to change.",
    "All those features.",
    "I'll have that build and I can just go in real fast and.",
    "An you know, Taylor, it up and remove like the mouth or change.",
    "Whatever I need without having to worry about.",
    "You know redrawing anything I don't have to worry about drawing one part.",
    "So let's see so this guy is yeah, he's.",
    "Dunn's color him in let's also move him above his buddy here.",
    "Then why are here let's do the same thing duplicate?",
    "Layer group let's merge together done an let's hide that one and let's hide the rough sketch.",
    "We don't need that anymore.",
    "So let's fill this guy in so we think for colors.",
    "Let's see here.",
    "Let's make him like a?",
    "It's a big fat a dog growing up, I don't know if you guys remember Doug Doug Funny.",
    "But they always had like fun colored characters like everyone was like different Oh you know what I noticed.",
    "Pretty sure on our bro back here I totally drew his arm lines in the wrong area OK hold on.",
    "We gotta go back.",
    "We gotta redo some stuff.",
    "To grace these?",
    "So race that excellently.",
    "Forgot what I was doing earlier drill the wrong layers.",
    "Yeah, that's one thing to point out always have like layer caution.",
    "No, that's a real thing, but you know trying to pay attention to what layers are on definitely important.",
    "So they don't make mistakes.",
    "Alright so let's keep filling this guy in let's see here it's better paint bucket stranger colors up high.",
    "Usually, when I color my pieces.",
    "I really don't have a game plan.",
    "I wish I could say I did.",
    "I just kind of pick things until they look good.",
    "I've been really into pink yellow and blue lately and it's kind of been a nice like step starting point.",
    "And then I kind of like figure it out from there.",
    "But yeah, I don't know like.",
    "Colors should be fun.",
    "I kind of like that, I'm not like tide down to something specific.",
    "Weird orange color, I don't know it's.",
    "Paint.",
    "Confront.",
    "Bootsy.",
    "That's it that's what I want.",
    "Collect purple, he looks like he's like not getting enough oxygen right now.",
    "Sorry.",
    "This was like mumbling through that so if you don't hear anyone else laying on the Mike.",
    "I apologize so it's just like a?",
    "Sound like an old like.",
    "Grumpy man like this, I gotta turn on the.",
    "Right so let's give this guy like green and like I was filling out nice orange tone for skin.",
    "Something like that this dude on the left looks like this guy right here.",
    "This guy looks like hold his breath like a man what's going on.",
    "It's like you I forgot to breathe always talking.",
    "Feel like I want to change his color so bad.",
    "I do, I really do.",
    "Thinking Blue, Oh, Same color is the shirt.",
    "Hello.",
    "It looks like he's choking.",
    "The facial expression I gave him that's the real problem here.",
    "Sure.",
    "OK, I like where we're going here.",

    "Let me restart this layer 'cause that looks awful.",
    "I'm actually in a different way.",
    "I'm going to grab a brush.",
    "Bob this way high.",
    "Parallel pressure dynamic.",
    "I'm just going to kind of poop.",
    "Only passing out of 5, so again making shadows the way I make shadows.",
    "I grab the main line color.",
    "And sometimes I'll just draw like a rough kind of crude shape and then I'll fill it.",
    "But for this, I feel like maybe I want a little bit more control, so I'm using that pressure sensitivity on the brush.",
    "Just kind of working it in.",
    "So I guess there's like a light source coming from my pads here coming down this way.",
    "I'm sure from the words come out.",
    "The light source is coming from the Camera basically 'cause that's where this guys looking right here.",
    "So let's see let's fill these guys in.",
    "Usually about 10 to 20 minutes, which I know I feel like in the world of digital video content that is like?",
    "Really long.",
    "Uhm but do another stream configured it out where I take a piece of Adobe software an either try to figure it out.",
    "Or teach you something about it may be something that I recently learned and want to share.",
    "It's all about just trying to figure out what you can do.",
    "Pretty much with the creative cloud and Adobe and I share a bunch of cool stuff on there.",
    "One of my favorites that I did not too long ago was uh.",
    "Was a beer can like art kind of thing with Adobe dimensions, so if you're looking to learn some new software.",
    "Maybe that's a good way to help you out.",
    "Go check it out.",
    "It is in the replays under my Behance profile and yeah, you know just some.",
    "Little food for thought there for everybody.",
    "One of the cool things about this about this streaming service if you will is that.",

    "I don't know if I like that little like.",
    "Inside of his mouth that I put in the background there.",
    "So people will lose that 'cause we don't have that in layer well.",
    "I can't speak always add that in later.",
    "Got hung up.",
    "That.",
    "Just there.",
    "And that shared in a minute.",
    "Do a new layer.",
    "Click here.",
    "Dynamics.",

    "Keep it the same.",
    "OK.",
    "Let's see.",
    "Let's grab this guy.",
    "Glad the circle.",
    "Alright so to my knowledge fresco does not have the ability to add in shapes yet like Adobe draw.",
    "Or sketch had so this is the way that I do it.",
    "I use the masking tool or yeah, mass tool to create a circle.",
    "Grab my little paint bucket here fill it in and make it a vector.",
    "And then deselect.",
    "Duplicate.",
    "Make it.",
    "White.",
    "Bill.",
    "Grab this shrink it down center it and.",
    "Sure, y'all are seeing what's happening here, we're starting to get a nice circle for the eye.",
    "That's a really good way to create shapes and also have a little bit of control over.",
    "Like the thickness of where lines are 'cause like I probably want that line that's you know if this head is kind of.",
    "Turned a little sideways there won't probably that line closest to us to be thicker 'cause of perspective.",
    "Some of these guys down let's grab tap this little guy here, the circle.",
    "So you turn the paint bucket into an eraser and just tap inside and boom we erase that section.",
    "And now we can see what's going on, we can instructions out here.",
    "Some dogs barking in the background.",

    "Everyone can.",
    "Everyone's an artist.",
    "You just gotta find really like.",
    "You know your vibe.",
    "In practice, and sometimes too like something that's really important to note about art, it's subjective for starters.",
    "So what I like and what you like, or two, probably very different things.",
    "But sometimes it's not about what you're making, is how you present it.",
    "So you know a prime example again was in art school.",
    "College story doesn't involve a bad haircut.",
    "When I was in art school we there's a girl in my class is in her illustration work I I'm not gonna say it back, it wasn't bad 'cause it is necessary that art.",

    "It wasn't my taste, will say and.",
    "But I remember my teacher was telling her she's like listen, it's not about the art you're making 'cause illustrations.",
    "They have a lot of detail and you can tell she's kind of frustrated.",
    "And he was saying how it's about how you present it and we need to do a class presentation and she ended up taking these illustrations and she made them very small and put them.",
    "She mad at them of so cool she mad at them in a huge frame.",
    "So it's like really small is like you know it would be like this big in the frame would be huge and this she just did this incredible job framing these pieces.",
    "And they looked so cool and what started out as he's like, really like kind of rough thumbnails on Bristol board ended up being like super killer awesome once they were like matted and framed an like put into the proper environment and again it was a true example of it's not that the arts bad, it's just it's how it was being presented.",
    "It just wasn't being presented properly.",
    "And then when it was presented properly it was like the coolest thing.",
    "Your hair is so thick it takes forever to dry suits.",
    "It's easier to keep it short.",

    "Alright, so let's let's let's lower the opacity of our rough sketch.",
    "Forgot our squid thing in place.",
    "We got pretty eyes and it's pretty eyes.",
    "Take a new layer.",
    "Remember shape tool and let's make it a circle.",
    "'cause eyeballs are circular.",
    "Let's move it over, so here, so take this here and let's put it there.",
    "So we are 30 minutes into the stream.",
    "I want to point out this stream is called late night with fresh cake.",
    "It happen Saturdays at 9:00 PM.",
    "Sometimes little later, depending.",

    "Don't they have like one eye is not like a thing?",
    "This is an octopus have.",
    "And they have like 4 hearts I don't know.",
    "You don't know that you can pick a favorite cartoon like music.",
    "You can't pick a favorite band, you know.",
    "Or movie.",
    "I think for that kind of stuff, like the way to identify.",
    "What your favorite is is to just be like what's the one that you default to the mouse like.",
    "I probably watch Futurama and regular show the most, so those are probably the two cartoons that I default to.",
    "All the time.",
    "So I moved everything down really quick.",
    "Want to point this out because I had started to form what's called a tangent, which is when you have like you make a piece of art and you have something else like if there's like an object coming in right here and it like just barely touches this like that's annoying.",
    "Handed.",
    "So I'm just kind of moved everything down so we're going to turn off pressure, velocity dynamics just so I can.",
    "Kinda rough in another eyeball on the back part here.",
    "So Heather, if you're still tuned in are you are you are doing tonight.",
    "I know.",
    "I think you're saying that you generally generally create something during the stream.",

    "Who's drawn along with me?",
    "Who's arting?",
    "You don't know what I'm talking about from the last stream on Wednesday, the happy hour we were talking about what we do and when we create and Heather decide to point out that she arts, which I thought was a very creative way to describe making something because it's true.",

    "So it's kind of fun.",
    "Little like take spin off.",
    "It's not like a true sequel, but you know, kind of pays homage to its roots, which is cool.",

    "I don't know how much I like that.",
    "Having various tips and tricks I do whenever I draw.",
    "And I just kind of go through them until I find something that works for the piece that I'm creating.",
    "So, sometimes, I'll get to a certain point, and I'll be like.",
    "Oh, like this worked for whatever drawing I was doing last.",
    "On here I kind of hated it the same way.",
    "But like right now, I'm looking at it like I don't know if I like this technique.",
    "The shadows are really like intense.",

    "Their little too thick.",
    "Sometimes, things don't require shading they actually require highlights instead and I guess with any good lighting.",
    "There's definitely much better artists out there than I.",
    "That will sit there and be like Well, you gotta add you know.",
    "Shading and highlights and all that kind of stuff to make complete peace.",
    "I'm making a cartoon so the.",
    "Usually, now, the flatter the color little better if that's a thing lighting is always extremely important.",
    "I sometimes just disregard it so like.",
    "I'm adding machine right now.",
    "Different tricks that I do again I was having fun.",
    "Sometimes just to kind of imply that there is like either like a shoulder.",
    "Or maybe some kind of death to a character.",
    "I'll just grab like a thinner line specials.",
    "Little bit and I'll just kind of like poop.",
    "About 100 and I'll follow the same color as the highlight and pull out at the end and it kinda implies.",
    "There is like some kind of either geometry, there to the body or like maybe there's a light source hitting it right there.",
    "Sometimes that works really well, especially if I'm fighting with like trying to shade an object sometimes it's sort of like.",
    "I don't know low.",
    "Call it like low fi shading.",
    "Ends up working really well and kind of working on this character actually kind of digging right now.",
    "And sometimes you can go back in later and then like you know actually add in.",
    "The shadows around this and it'll look really nice like here can do one.",
    "Maybe it'll work.",
    "It's like you're kind of like mapping, it in you know.",
    "I actually really enjoy that so let's let's let's keep this gravy train rolling here.",
    "I think.",
    "I think sometimes you gotta change your process to get like a new result, something that you're going to be happy with.",
    "I don't know if anyone hears a fan of doom.",
    "The video game, but there's really good interview on YouTube with the guy who wrote the music for it.",
    "And he talks about that and his famous quote I think in his one of his.",
    "Like talks that he did was we changed the process you change the result and sometimes if you're struggling to get?",
    "Result that's the best way to find a new one.",
    "Change the process it change the result.",
    "Cell phones, not working.",
    "Things result purchase process.",
    "They get new results.",
    "There's another artist streaming earlier.",
    "Very talented and she was saying that.",
    "To redraw things multiple times that's always a good way.",
    "Lead sled so glad that she's a new streamer.",
    "Here, a very talented artist kind of artists.",
    "All link out in my description to our account.",
    "To go.",
    "Let's see.",
    "I don't know if I like that.",
    "Thoughts feelings emotions.",
    "Just gotta stick with the shading here.",
    "Can do that?",
    "Boo.",
    "Shoot.",
    "Hi.",
    "Here, I go Rd.",
    "Oops.",
    "Making layers get real airs out there, so I need to connect Oh boy and there, we have it.",
    "I like that line on the Top let's remove that really quick.",
    "Can't fill I don't want you to fill his way to race there we go.",
    "Her when we think.",
    "Now he needs that that line underneath moving this line on Top.",
    "I think those lines are not going to cut right.",
    "Trying to remember that going to run this through a vinyl machine later and see if I can get it to go into a?",
    "Skateboard.",
    "But you know what?",
    "It's part of the creative process.",
    "Let's just see.",
    "Maybe it'll work if it doesn't fix it.",
    "OK let's put this.",
    "Let's put his head in.",
    "Click I'm breezing through this one tonight.",
    "Or 30 minutes in I'm like almost done.",
    "Crazy.",
    "Let's see here.",
    "True.",

    "So.",
    "Whenever I make her.",
    "Really lazy about it in the house to describe that just now.",
    "Here let's lower this opacity down a little bit.",
    "And the reason why I say that is because I was just make these giant like amorphous blobs for starters.",
    "So, like not.",
    "I don't know.",
    "It's like a severe lack of control like do this paint bucket fill, it in.",
    "And let's grab this guy here.",
    "OK, so race that.",
    "Then we're going to.",
    "Sorry I feel like it looks like a just pick my nose is known as doing scratching it, which is right underneath.",
    "Huh.",
    "Ooh you see that guy, he picks his nose.",
    "Alright cool, then I fill it in and then I have, like luscious locks, you know.",
    "Then just painting in the detail.",
    "Makes a lot easier.",
    "And it's always nice like 100 art teacher in college and always pointed out that like you need to have something to help.",
    "Thank you, you're drawing like a large spotted black or some kind of.",
    "I don't know I don't focus point, 'cause That's not what I mean, but just something that helps anchor the drawing down.",
    "And you know large blocks of color always a really good way to do that to kind of help.",
    "No just help it along a little bit.",
    "Give your eyes, something that kind of kind of get locked in on.",
    "So.",
    "One of the ways to do that always was to just add in like areas of black like Phil stuff in and we used to do like these like.",
    "Pretty large drawings actually trying to see if I have any of my board here.",
    "Yeah, like stuff like this like we used to do these like really cool illustrations.",
    "I'm never gonna see that where it was like these like?",
    "Modge Podge is have like little characters and stuff, and you just kinda Bristol and like sketched all over him.",
    "And then you'd have to find spots in filaments like the ground under this like weird characters foot, right here.",
    "Get the filament in black and it was always kind of cool, we would do like these other little like.",
    "Exercises where we would take like should scan this in now.",
    "Yeah man hit the floor alike.",

    "Not surprised there listening they knew.",
    "Slurp or whatever.",
    "I'm convinced that when he when Justin Roiland comes up with names for things he just liked, says a bunch of alsenz like, I'll add in a couple.",
    "Or is this a bunch of like consonants and he's like I'll just add some vowels in their later.",
    "It makes sense.",
    "And it was like, alright?",
    "I did watch I'm making up with Dan Harmon recently, though about Rick and Morty.",
    "It's an old videos on YouTube.",
    "They're talking about some of the episodes and like how they did that YouTube court case thing for Rick and Morty.",
    "It's pretty awesome to hear how they came up with it.",
    "It's also really weird interview 'cause Dan Harmon for some reason is dressed like.",
    "Like an old Shakespearean.",
    "Back there is very odd.",
    "We can start rolling names.",
    "Tiffany was got.",
    "Any ideas?",
    "Feel free to shout him out in the chat.",
    "Let us know what this name of this character will be.",

    "With the page.",
    "There we go.",
    "What's the program name Anken Adobe illustrator make this result of lines yes, OK, so this software is called Adobe fresco.",
    "You can download it from the App Store.",
    "I'm drawing on ipad and you can bring you can bring this in as a PDF into illustrator.",
    "We can bring it into Photoshop via creative cloud and you could create similar lines.",
    "I'm using vector lines.",
    "You could create very similar lines with illustrator.",
    "You just gotta have a tablet and set your pen sensitivity up.",
    "So like let's say you have a closure calligraphy pen set up.",
    "You could then set it so that your pen pressure reads the same point as your same width as what your brushes that.",
    "So if your brushes that to five so the pressure to go to five an, you can achieve kind of the same goal, but you won't have as much control as something like this.",
    "Are those default brushes?",
    "Yeah, so this is a default brush in Adobe fresco.",
    "Here I can show you all is awesome love these kinds of questions.",
    "These are good so.",
    "For starters, who out there that's watching right now is familiar with Adobe fresco.",
    "Let's start there.",
    "If you're not familiar at all, I'm going to run through the three brush sets right now.",
    "If you are familiar with it, I apologize.",
    "This is going to be, you know, a little bit of a little repetitive, but that's all good.",
    "So good.",
    "Brush up.",
    "So there are three brush sets in Adobe fresco.",
    "One brush is the pixel brush.",
    "That's when I have sex right now.",
    "This actually just like a Photoshop brush.",
    "It is no different.",
    "It has.",
    "They like to come in there like Oh my gosh.",
    "Comes.",
    "Their thick hair.",
    "I'll bring us in.",
    "I'm going to sink in this I like.",
    "I was talking about going to a couple things were first offered to duplicate this layer and then we're going to hide it.",
    "Would take this bottom layer going to race the center just like that.",
    "And we're going to hide this and you know, you get the idea where we're going.",
    "Lot of hiding and revealing, so let's scale this up.",
    "We're going to have it kinda.",
    "Don't you.",
    "Doing women kind of just breaking this plane here a little bit or it's going to race like that.",
    "Forgot this later when I drag it underneath turn on this.",
    "Turn on the Slayer guitar paint bucket.",
    "Let's just get our background just a color.",
    "It doesn't matter, just as long as it's not the same color as the linework fill it in merged.",
    "Krampus layer here, so I'm on the layer underneath the eye or something and I were scale that up a little bit.",
    "It's going to kind of this is going to create that illusion that the eye is being really set back in the head.",
    "Going to merge these two together.",
    "Thanks will do that and there we go look at this eyeball.",
    "Just kind of like you know stuck in there.",
    "For him the baseboard.",
    "I know I was talking about having the eyeball look at look towards us, but I kind of wanted just to be like looking into the whatever.",
    "They double charge you for the thickness of your hair.",
    "That sounds like they're just being a bunch of jerks.",
    "You can't help it.",
    "It is jealous.",
    "Like how much dreams about like hairdressers right now?",
    "Hey Everybody, welcome to the stream for fresh cake let's talk about her.",
    "I will say when I had her, you know.",
    "Before I had a kid and.",
    "Life happened.",
    "Hum.",
    "Back when I had hair, I used to go to like a Cool Barber.",
    "It was awesome.",
    "I used to love going.",
    "Your main sector sector is video.",
    "All it's awesome 3D motion graphics dude.",
    "I love mograph.",
    "If you want to see I did post my real in the discord.",
    "If you don't know what discord is, yes, thank you.",
    "Heather has already beat me to the punch.",
    "Please join the discord and post your work and love to check it out.",
    "If you want to see my motion work.",

    "We want to watch.",
    "Like I always love seeing peoples motion rails.",
    "So fun fact before I got into illustration, I was doing motion design FY I peeps.",
    "I'm not super cool that you do 3D.",
    "What kind of 3D do you do like cinema 4D or like are using blender?",
    "'cause I'm trying to learn that.",
    "Right now I've got nowhere.",
    "I've downloaded the software that's as far as I've gone.",
    "Alright, so again, we're using the basic round brush in Adobe fresco here on my old iPad I use a six Gen iPad 32 gig and not a lot of space on it for being honest.",
    "Got like 3 days left.",
    "Just chugs along.",
    "Alright, let's see here.",
    "No undo the body.",
    "It's very, very at the point of the body.",
    "Actually, let's duplicate this.",
    "I really quick duplicate.",
    "What am I doing?",
    "There we go?",
    "Nothing wrong with a lot thicker brush by the way tonight than I normally do.",
    "Where are my?",
    "Thank you Jack for posting it deeply.",
    "Deeply is that outside Ghibli?",
    "I'm I found really interesting that that's on.",
    "Max on HBO maxed out because I thought Disney bought them, but I guess not.",
    "Maybe maybe Warner did.",
    "Everybody's getting owned by the same companies at this point.",
    "Where are my anime fans at?",
    "Are there anybody?",
    "Is anyone in the chat here?",
    "Big anime fans?",
    "If so, please say hello and let me know what your favorite anime is.",
    "Um?",
    "Colonel minus.",
    "Kind of thing now it's one that I always go back to.",
    "One punch man I watched I watched a few Times Now.",
    "Place some of that two or three times twice.",
    "And I like one punch man alive.",
    "I don't know if it counts as my favorite.",
    "Very nice fresco allows drawing beyond the canvas.",
    "Yeah it does.",
    "It doesn't want to pixel brush but it does with the vector brush.",
    "I find that very interesting Pok\u00e9mon.",
    "Listen, Sam, don't get me started on Pok\u00e9mon.",
    "We've had this conversation before.",
    "It doesn't go well for you all, right?",
    "Doctor all about it.",
    "how I find it very weird that the Pok\u00e9mon can only say their names like don't make any other noises, just that you feel lazy.",
    "Alright, let's put some miles from spreading.",
    "Blow this guy or girl.",
    "But gender neutral really matter.",
    "I'm going to make it kind of like puffy, puffy and cloudy.",
    "Or do we want to be like?",
    "Oh, I like that better.",
    "OK, we're going to go down this road.",
    "'cause we gotta do?",
    "What kind of like this?",
    "Like there's so many ways to make like A.",
    "To make a like a cloud kind of vibe in my style.",
    "Here I'll show you over here this several ways that I make puffy things.",
    "One is to do something like this.",
    "Where it's a little bit more like a goo, and then you kind of add these like.",
    "These, like you know blobs, that kind of shoot off.",
    "That's always really fun the other way that I do it is by kind of creating like.",
    "These like 100 overlapping shapes where they kind of do things like.",
    "Like this?",
    "But that runs the risk of looking like intestines, so we're going to we're going to end up doing this.",
    "Has got to be a little more fluid, so we're going to do it this way.",
    "True.",
    "Now I know that I'm kind of like crudely dropping these in and none of my points are kind of, you know, connecting, creating clean lines and it looks really weird with having the main character sort of, you know, all the transparency.",
    "It's all good, but I turned it off.",
    "I hope it looks decent.",
    "I don't know.",
    "We're going to find out a whole lot of this is just experimenting.",
    "The reason why the transparency set down though, so I can clean up and do things like this.",
    "So fun little fresco trick for anyone wondering how I'm racing so quickly 'cause I often get asked this question.",
    "If you tap your little dial here with your brush selected it turns it into an eraser and then to get rid of this line quickly instead of sitting here going like this because that's a pain in the butt.",
    "If you have that thing still selected and you drag down making the circle solid and you just kind of draw this blue line, you can get rid of stuff whatever the blue line cuts through will disappear.",
    "So helpful trick.",
    "Thanks for raising things quickly.",
    "Easy.",
    "Hello.",
    "Alright, let's see here.",
    "And let's go over and take another new layer.",
    "Let's just start kind of put in some of the bigger cloudy areas are going to fill the scene.",
    "So we're going to draw right through.",
    "Um?",
    "We're just going to write through kind of the leg here, and the reason for this 'cause we're, we turn it all up and fill everything in and kind of race things and merge everything together.",
    "I started watching it not too long ago so that one is definitely it's in my queue.",
    "It's on my list being watched.",
    "Alright, So what do the whole of the donut here and the way that we're going to do that is?",
    "My kind of doing this overlap because there's going to be like have creeks you know inside that we're looking at, and then just kind of rounding it out right here.",
    "Yeah, I feel like I'm gonna have like a pastry being kind of stream this week, which would be really cool.",
    "There we go.",
    "Yeah, I love Henson films.",
    "Fun fact, so I live in Connecticut and UConn for anyone interested out there that like Jim Henson puppets, UConn has one of the most top rated puppet programs in the country that a lot of the students from there go to work.",
    "Or the Jim Henson Studio.",
    "Whatever?",
    "Maybe that is.",
    "I know it's called Henson Studios or whatever, but also, how did Jim Henson exhibit?",
    "I don't know if it's still up, but in New York, which obviously right now Cove, it is a little bit of a hard thing to go.",
    "Do that.",
    "But things are opening up slowly.",
    "Slowly but surely.",
    "Alright, so I'm going to bar circle tool.",
    "We're going to do the flick.",
    "Send vector art.",
    "And where to go here?",
    "Move on down little race and let's get rid of the shape tool.",
    "I'm going to create.",
    "A new layer is going to draw in the top part of the foot.",
    "Now whenever I draw a fresh cake foot there people would like to point out the fact that my characters don't have feet or shoes or any kind of definition.",
    "They're kind of just like this weird leg that forms into a stock thing.",
    "This is the fresh take style.",
    "I don't know, it's just a foot.",
    "Also, we are about 40 minutes in, so in 20 minutes I'll be doing a comic review.",
    "Today we are going to be talking about let's talk comics.",
    "Understanding comics so it's really cool book about how to make comics.",
    "I'll talk about it.",
    "I figured you know.",
    "Uh.",
    "We're a bunch of Creatives in here, presumably trying to create and instead of sharing a book that I just enjoy reading, I'd share something that that, you know, maybe it can help you make something.",
    "And where my comic nerds at in the chat and say hi?",
    "And also shallow some comics you like that you're reading right now.",
    "I'd love to talk about him.",
    "I'll let you know if I'm reading them or not.",
    "I think I'm going to start rereading head lopper don't know if anyone is familiar with that.",
    "By Andrew McLean, really good comic.",
    "One of my favorites.",
    "By one of my favorite artists.",
    "Also.",
    "Just a really nice guy.",
    "Met him once, was awesome.",
    "Now, why is this Android?",
    "OK.",
    "Ruler on.",
    "There we go.",
    "That was weird.",
    "Little bit of a bug, no big deal.",
    "Like that needs to be thicker, so something that I want to point out 'cause I fall victim to this quite a bit when drawing zoom out on your illustrations.",
    "I don't do that enough, it's one area that like I had this problem was in college and learning how to draw.",
    "I would like get like this on the paper and be super close to it.",
    "I'd be like.",
    "Face against it and then spent all this time of year when I look out and then it won't match up with the rest of the illustration.",
    "So just happened.",
    "Now is too close to drawing in my line work for the leg really wasn't thinking of, especially in comparison to that tongue.",
    "That sounds pretty heavy.",
    "I should have probably made out a little thinner, but instead we're going to worry about trying to match everything else up to the tongue versus matching the tongue down to everything else.",
    "I do want to also point out down in the bottom.",
    "I don't know where it is down.",
    "If you were to hover over the playhead right now or over the top of the video player down in the bottom.",
    "I believe it's going to be your bottom left down the bottom left so it will be somewhere over this area.",
    "Down underneath there is a live button.",
    "If you click it, it'll jump ahead to live.",
    "So in case your stream labs and you fall behind, you don't think you're caught up to speed or taking too long to answer your questions in your curious as to where I am, you might be way back in the video and I'm not.",
    "You know I'm ahead of you so click that little button and it'll jump into the right spot.",
    "Oh boy mess this up 'cause I went down too far into the part of the beard.",
    "Hold on folks layer.",
    "Discovered Adobe capture waiting in Logan Airport, like way long ago.",
    "Boston and I decided that.",
    "Like I was going to try to like make brushes out of like elements that I found around the airport, which you know.",
    "Seems like a good idea, but then you're just a weirdo with your Phone out walking around an airport just taking pictures of everything when you start to look kinda sketchy.",
    "I did end up with some cool cool results, taking pictures like the rafters and stuff in the building so.",
    "Harmony app to try that with it doesn't always work.",
    "It definitely works.",
    "Better to like kind of create something that you would just kind of like dab around on the screen, and used to make textures.",
    "I don't know if I'd make a brush that would be used as like something for like but I intend to actually drag across the screen, and paint with.",
    "But it'll be capture is a pretty sweet app.",
    "So you can do some cool stuff for that.",
    "The pattern tool that is pretty rad.",
    "Like you can take anything and turn it into like 70s wallpaper.",
    "Alright gotta crazy looking person.",
    "Looks kind of like a?",
    "I said your name from the League rafi or whatever his name is.",
    "The hilarious character with anyone here watch the League watch it for a little bit.",
    "It was fun.",
    "Alright let's let's hire rough sketch.",
    "Let's put in some detail here.",
    "It's kind of.",
    "So 'cause the beard is all black we gotta.",
    "Going to kind of paint in.",
    "Little lips and stuff, and white so I'm actually just going to.",
    "Use the sort of like circle.",
    "I keep touching by the way it takes the brush are currently using and turns it into like an eraser.",
    "Which is really cool function?",
    "Little better right now here we go.",
    "I like it a lot.",
    "I've started using in a bunch.",
    "And I kind of like it 'cause I can set my normal eraser.",
    "Like the eraser tool here to something specific and then I can set like usually this race for tool set something like really large so I have, like a really bigger racer and then I'll use.",
    "This my current brushes and eraser as well.",
    "So I have 2 races and I can kind of switch between quicker and work, a little faster.",
    "I want to have like a snarl kind of lip.",
    "Will raise up that one too.",
    "It looks kinda weird?",
    "Maybe not it was leave the bottom lip.",
    "There's like a little.",
    "Something that.",
    "Yeah, go check out Adobe capture it's really rad.",
    "There are some cool stuff in there like I said the pattern tool is pretty pretty pretty sweet.",
    "Traffic I capture colors with it.",
    "Actually, no, I use Adobe capture a whole lot.",
    "When here, you know what I'm drawing on an iPad I can show you.",
    "Mac Adobe capture.",
    "So.",
    "I use it for all sorts of stuff, he's going to have a bunch of weird shapes and things 'cause.",
    "I just take pictures of things, but I really like the colours alot on it, and I use this all the time to capture colors.",
    "I go in constantly and will like you take pictures turn the Camera and take a picture or something.",
    "Do real-time tutorial here people right Camera.",
    "Oh, boy, it's going to get weird or here's my desk.",
    "Could grab some colors from my Mac mini and things boom.",
    "And it kind of, well, yeah, it'll sort of like create gradients and kind of give you some some cool stuff to kind of work with you can find like you know all different stuff look at the image.",
    "You can kind of movies around in the image we got like a PlayStation controller over here.",
    "And this is like a Super Wack fast tutorial and then you hit save.",
    "It will save it as a color palette for you and it'll kind of it will throw it up into here and then you can have a color that you can access in your CC library, so it's really fun app highly recommend it.",
    "There's other cool stuff in there, too, like OK now we're now we're now we're talking.",
    "There it is like I said earlier.",
    "All that weird line work all the magic smoke and mirrors just revealed.",
    "Let's say pending.",
    "Happy happy with me, but I think if anyone here is actually a fan of Penn and Teller.",
    "You know that they like to like.",
    "Show their secrets or something that will show about it.",
    "But.",
    "So again if anyone's watching right now and wants to you know.",
    "Hop in the chat talk a little bit.",
    "Tell me about your day.",
    "Feel free.",
    "Not all good.",
    "Just keep on drawing.",
    "I don't know if I like that shading on the hair.",
    "I'm just going to come down off the head here.",
    "Connect that fill it in.",
    "Cool.",
    "I feel his ear like needs like.",
    "A whole lot of everything in life, like deeds like help.",
    "What do we think?",
    "Will keep the shading shading actually helps a lot and just don't like the shading on the ear.",
    "Alright that part.",
    "Alright so let's bring back on my pressure dynamic really quick.",
    "Let's just put in.",
    "So she lips.",
    "Down here.",
    "His mouth.",
    "Clips would create some kind of shade.",
    "Working little quick here right now, I'm just kinda rough in this stuff in.",
    "Like found my groove with the shading now that I liked step back for a second and.",
    "Again, try something a little different.",
    "What could these to be talking about?",
    "It's such a goober.",
    "Cool.",
    "Oh, you know what is tongue need some training down the bottom here?",
    "There we go.",
    "Alright let's add a few more of those like little like you know, these lines in the dark lines.",
    "It's kind of close to his like noodle.",
    "Little dots.",
    "It's too close to each other.",
    "Sometimes you put lines, too close to each other.",
    "It's called I believe it's called intangible.",
    "Or at least a teacher.",
    "I had an article called with that means it's kind of like an unpleasing thing to the I like it's too close.",
    "That.",
    "Is not the right term and I sound like a total nerd?",
    "So we let me know because I'm sending a note if I do it, but whatever.",
    "Right and you know what?",
    "You know this guy needs, he needs some.",
    "Tongue tongue fungus tampon dots.",
    "Right now.",
    "Like some.",
    "Joke.",
    "Collection.",
    "Years of You know.",
    "This is actually from college.",
    "I should scan this in.",
    "And.",
    "I don't know retrace over it and stuff, but in in kit in Prescott would be awesome.",
    "But one of the cool things to eat to do is like?",
    "We would take a little piece of paper in Kendall Square out and put it on this like large splash page and then find really detailed areas that we thought really cool.",
    "And then you would use that to you know identify like a unique spot and then add in some black to that area and you get a really unique drawing out of it was a really neat exercise.",
    "How to draw backwards by accident and that's something that I should start to consider?",
    "OK let's see here.",
    "Yeah, let's just do this with this election there.",
    "Dirt, sand in detail.",
    "He just went too far with those 2 lines.",
    "Did?",
    "Let's see if more people joined watching you guys have any questions is what I'm doing or what I'm drawing in.",
    "Under the party want to know some stuff.",
    "Feel free to ask.",
    "Uh.",
    "Little conversation going.",
    "Art dot map I don't know music.",
    "We will talk about.",
    "Let's guys got some, like weird liver spot things going on as I always do I think it's like a common theme right now?",
    "A lot of my illustrations.",
    "Sort of wonder if I liked it better without that.",
    "I like it just clean, but I don't know.",
    "3 think.",
    "The response no liver spots.",
    "Put on a new layer.",
    "That way we can turn it on and off as we please.",
    "If you look at the shot through this, drawing like way quicker than I thought I would.",
    "Let's see here let's add in.",
    "Let's talk about this earlier, but I wasn't sure if I liked.",
    "Having a little bit of.",
    "Phil right here, but I think I want it.",
    "Now you know leave it off like that without.",
    "Board will you with it or does it need to come from here?",
    "So many questions not answers.",
    "So think about ad that I need to add like a cheek and oops.",
    "Go down that Rd.",
    "So.",
    "Let's just leave it blank let's leave it alone.",
    "Alright so we got this cool guy.",
    "Let's see here so next step.",
    "I want to take all these layers.",
    "Let's put them altogether.",
    "And like I said, This is an illustration.",
    "That's going to get put on a board somehow.",
    "I'm going to try to put it on a board.",
    "Skateboard wider we have put it, there, but And I'll post that process, but for the you know in my projects like I say it but.",
    "Why we're here?",
    "Why don't we duplicate this an make a fun colored illustration out of it?",
    "So let's fill this guy in let's do.",
    "Fairly quickly to fill him in you know what?",
    "Let's try something fairly cold process that I used to do.",
    "We have a really weird great hour.",
    "Drop it behind.",
    "Let's Do this, let's.",
    "Work layers in Group.",
    "Then merge down so we had this nice vector layer grab our paint bucket, which we already have selected.",
    "That are a little colder widget.",
    "I don't really know what to call this thing, but tap this.",
    "Tap on the outside.",
    "Let's race.",
    "All that great on the back.",
    "So now are on that on the outside of it?",
    "What is presumably?",
    "Behind the head so that we have this kind of like nice sort of building character.",
    "We kind of see areas.",
    "And.",
    "Let's just like this just fill in some stuff here.",
    "I'm trying to have more process to my drawings to help me kind of make better illustrations.",
    "And one thing that I found is kind of nice is doing this little bit of.",
    "It has a whole bunch of cool stuff so you can go back.",
    "There's like a little plus sign.",
    "You can import brushes just like you do in photos.",
    "It acts just like photo shop.",
    "It's photoshopped.",
    "I don't know.",
    "I'm not going to try to explain any further.",
    "You can even get brushes from the creative cloud if you want to have an import directly right here device.",
    "And then there's all sorts of good stuff.",
    "So there's like your basic kind of you know, standard.",
    "Brush their hard round.",
    "You've also got like all your kind of like soft brushes.",
    "You know pretty cool stuff like that, but we're really excels as you can get all sorts of cool things like comic brushes like you can get like halftone textures and stuff of that nature.",
    "You know you can go back and we could check out there's like markers, I mean.",
    "Possibilities are endless, let's so let's throw a couple in here.",
    "Let's let's put a couple colors 'cause they're kind of fun.",
    "You can kind of.",
    "Can create some really cool stuff with us.",
    "Let's go, let's go to painting.",
    "Let's grab like a canvas like flat brush here through the canvas color in there it's pretty rad.",
    "So that's the pixel brush, another brush option that they have in here is.",
    "Is the live brush so these are oil paints, watercolors, those kinds of things and they act a lot like it.",
    "So if you take a water colorless, I always like to wash softap and you kind of like paint, something it bleeds like a watercolor.",
    "If you tap your layer you can hit dry layer and it will freeze it wherever it was really nice.",
    "Z you have a Wakame Centriq 16 to enterprise settings and apply it on pressure but actually doesn't give me this result at all.",
    "Really that's really interesting.",
    "I've achieved similar results in the past.",
    "Let me finish tutorial going through this tutorial on brushes and we'll talk about that.",
    "So the watercolor brush.",
    "It's really cool.",
    "You can do that and you also have like an oil paint brush that looks like oils.",
    "Kind of like this.",
    "You know you can kind of, you know they cut out like it does like with oil paints do where they kind of swirl around each other and you can mix colors.",
    "You some cool things with it, right?",
    "Like there's are green.",
    "We can get into the orange, so that's kind of neat, right?",
    "Something that always really love to show about this.",
    "Remember that pixel layer we made?",
    "Let's grab that watercolor really quick.",
    "You can play them together, it's super cool so you have a lot of flexibility with fresco and then of course then we could draw layer and will get rid of that 'cause we don't need it.",
    "Let's see here delete.",
    "Make a new layer so.",
    "Ah, I'm drawing though with the vector brush so you don't get this kind of result.",
    "One thing I will note that maybe is causing the difference in the result is that fresco does have a smoothing function that you can kind of alternate set.",
    "So I set my somewhere between 80 and 90, but that gives you really smooth lines.",
    "Again, I've had similar results 'cause I originally started drawing with my style and in illustrator and not too much has changed as far as like what the end result looks like.",
    "Part of it also is just having a steady hand in practice.",
    "So I would you know, I would focus on that kind of stuff.",
    "I find it interesting that you're not getting the same result.",
    "16 Ann I edit brush settings to apply on pressure with the pressure setting I'm at.",
    "And I say your name right?",
    "I don't want to get anyone would be really bummed out.",
    "Up there you go.",
    "Jack Watson everybody.",
    "Got the ends on what to do with illustrator.",
    "So.",
    "For all questions, her for that.",
    "Maybe pop open illustrator while we're in here and then you can.",
    "You can try some stuff out, maybe we can give you some tips and tricks and try to achieve something similar you know.",
    "Love to help you out.",
    "Get your drawn get drawn in the fresh cake style.",
    "Have you use procreate OK and you go to the University of Georgia?",
    "Oh, that's awesome.",
    "So what got you?",
    "Matthew will guide you into what made you want to go to drawing school after working as a gardener.",
    "Professional Gregor.",
    "And wait, is that we said earlier your professional gardener?",
    "I don't wanna, let's call it you or anything, but it's really cool if that's what?",
    "If that's what it was and how did you get into that profession.",
    "I was like hearing about people that are watching.",
    "We think it's really cool like we all lead such interesting lives.",
    "Alright, so let's Here in this town.",
    "I'm off.",
    "Then let's fill that I did that wrong.",
    "I'm going back to my old draw days.",
    "You have to fill button down below.",
    "This is the shape tool, by the way, this is not in the current version of fresco.",
    "It is only on the pre release version, but it is coming to fresco so keep your eyes peeled.",
    "You'll get this eventually.",
    "Alright, let's erase the center and I want to mention while we're in here and I'm making art.",
    "Usually Iraq, like a nine point, but I'm actually kind of liking the thicker.",
    "Using an ATM like double the size of water normally AM.",
    "Really freaking bomb dude.",
    "Thanks man.",
    "I appreciate it.",
    "Yeah, I was a fun one to do.",
    "Actually worked with a buddy of mine on the voiceover part.",
    "A lot of fun design tropes in there.",
    "If you actually listen to it, kind of probably not the best thing to send to clients 'cause I'm like making fun of client work, but it's still.",
    "It was a good time.",
    "We had a lot of fun making that.",
    "Now you can share whatever work you want in the discord please.",
    "It's you know, as long as it's art.",
    "I mean, if you want to share like you know thesis or something or like a dissertation like I guess I'll maybe read it, I don't know.",
    "Always use C4D and after effects it's awesome.",
    "Nice work at ref.",
    "I know we're trying to stay there.",
    "I got you.",
    "I'll see here.",
    "Let's have the headset to make a new layer.",
    "We go, let's take this.",
    "Let's just drag it down to the bottom and let's lower the Opacity so it's a little easier to see what we're doing.",
    "Let's turn off pressure velocity with Turner brush size up to like 22.",
    "Maybe a little thicker.",
    "Nothing went on pick lines tonight.",
    "It's 31 is way too thick 24 yeah.",
    "Now let's go back down to 20.",
    "Actually my body was in the chat once.",
    "Now I'm thinking about it.",
    "Think.",
    "Is available for free via work.",
    "When I was looking for somebody.",
    "Super bad guy.",
    "I would read it.",
    "Who wouldn't read it like?",
    "Alright everyone, you off homework this weekend, right?",
    "Right your senior poster, senior thesis or write it.",
    "You know, in the discord and will review.",
    "I don't know what I did for senior thesis in college because I actually think we started like a legit production company.",
    "And we did like a whole thing with, like different projects, we're going to make an all sorts of fun stuff.",
    "Actually, pretty cool.",
    "Oh no thanks man.",
    "For like in the video on video I just saw that just pygmy.",
    "That's super cool.",
    "Also, just learned that you can like videos on video.",
    "I've never like doesn't really look at that.",
    "I check out video regularly, like daily.",
    "Actually there we go.",
    "That's a good question for the crew.",
    "What Is everybody's favorite design site to go to to try to get inspiration?",
    "Mine is arguably the hands I live on this site, but where do you all go to get your inspiration while you're thinking about demographic issue really quick 'cause my nose is running.",
    "Um allergies man allergies are brutal, brutal, where omissions over there now.",
    "Other one go to get inspiration.",
    "Pinterest is another big one for me.",
    "I use Pinterest quite a bit.",
    "Put other sites motionographer love motionographer so good.",
    "Alright, let's do the legs, so let's turn back on our pressure velocity turn this brush.",
    "Down.",
    "Well, that's weird looking like, but I liked it like what it did like that it got out like wide and then went thinner.",
    "Into it.",
    "So again, the question was favorite.",
    "Um?",
    "It was my favorite site for creative inspiration.",
    "It'll look good.",
    "The reason why I draw through right there, so you kind of make sure that you know.",
    "If this were a real thing, this would kind of actually expand down into their now just feel a little weird.",
    "So add a little kind of shape.",
    "Maybe in here I don't know.",
    "It will kind of help it out.",
    "Drawn right through stuff like this kind of allows for like easier cleanup.",
    "No already.",
    "I gotta say, I asked.",
    "Norm's favorite anime is and I'm kind of surprised that it didn't really outside Sheridan.",
    "Surprise, I didn't really get a lot of responses.",
    "I thought I was going to have quite a few there.",
    "Everybody sharing Electra is another streamer here.",
    "Gotta Streamers today watching.",
    "I kinda like it.",
    "I gotta get up streamer and chat graphic going.",
    "Going to make 1.",
    "Uh.",
    "More things to do added to the list.",
    "Now I say that lovingly, it's fun making up all the assets and stuff for the streams.",
    "Alright, so Speaking of which, I am going to be adding a new stream to the list, so I do four streams right now for week two of them are called happy hour.",
    "They happen Monday and Wednesday at 6:00 PM and then I do Fridays at noon, a timelapse, vertical bunch of art, few hours of drawing condensed into a few minutes.",
    "It's like a good bite size lunch break, kind of viewing.",
    "Kind of experiencing anyway, so those three and then I do this one right here.",
    "But I am going to be adding a new one relatively soon called random stream.",
    "And just like the name says.",
    "Is a random stream.",
    "Guess what?",
    "It just happens randomly like whatever the heck.",
    "I feel like it so the only way really be able to see that is if you give me a follow up here on the hand.",
    "So if you like what you're watching right now and like hearing me Apple lot, give me a follow behance.net backslash fresh cake and you'll get you know get notified when I go live and then you won't miss the random stream and you can watch him on replays.",
    "I don't know when the random streams gonna happen 'cause you know it's random OC that doesn't match.",
    "It's gotta be like this.",
    "But it's going to be a mix of stuff.",
    "Sometimes I'll be drawing.",
    "There's going to be some video content.",
    "I'll be showing some things, for example on the next random stream whenever it happens at some point.",
    "The very first one I do know is going to be a video collaboration from print shop that I worked with to create this really cool vinyl on wood illustration thing.",
    "Sort of like video packages.",
    "That kind of stuff something a little bit different than just me drawing on an iPad and talking to all of you all the time.",
    "Yeah, no problem.",
    "Thanks for sharing.",
    "It says you are totally welcome.",
    "Please feel free to plug any other streamers.",
    "Like I said earlier, I think mentioned this era and Jack.",
    "Feel free plug yourselves in the chat.",
    "Please put your schedules there so everyone can TuneIn and anyone watching that does not follow them.",
    "Please give them a follow.",
    "Also, for the regulars who had been watching the streams, have you found the one you really liked and you can't say me?",
    "I don't count your watching right now, so I'm assuming that are just watching me 'cause you're like.",
    "I'm gonna make fun of this pool.",
    "Damn, I'm looking at you anyway.",
    "Let me know who you're watching that you really like right now.",
    "'cause you know, I watch a lot of streams too.",
    "And maybe you're watching someone that I haven't found yet and I want to watch when I catch up.",
    "I want to be cool.",
    "Let's just looking like goop goop goop.",
    "Alright let's, let's do a couple things, or at 43 minutes in full die so fast.",
    "Alright, let's watch this down.",
    "Let's turn up the opacity, unless this merges altogether.",
    "Oh, wait, no, let's not do that yet.",
    "We gotta clean up some stuff like this little area.",
    "One thing I do want to point out that gets kind of weird like I'm going to clean it would be very careful like a surgeon.",
    "So they want to be careful about sometimes, so like those little folds that I add, if it goes down below something and it doesn't have like a like, it looks like it gets.",
    "Like this like how it looked.",
    "It just looks like a mistake so try to keep a little bit of distance.",
    "Kind of between that looks like this little space here.",
    "A favorite anime is probably ghost in the shell you know Sarah.",
    "I've never actually watched.",
    "Ghost in the shell like kind of embarrassed about that.",
    "I feel like that's something that I should have.",
    "Had to choose very yeah, sharing to watch the stream.",
    "You have to choose a favorite anime otherwise.",
    "The stream just cut out like if you watch 5 minutes and you don't tell me exactly who you like it just it just shuts off.",
    "I don't know that worked out with Adobe or they were like you.",
    "Sure you want this features like yes very.",
    "Now you don't have to pick one if you don't.",
    "If you don't know.",
    "You know it's up to you.",
    "You can share.",
    "Share your fave if you have one, but you know what?",
    "Get this guy some frosting frosting pants.",
    "Wake me up at the thing.",
    "Frost in pants.",
    "Now I have the Sesame Street song stuck in my head and I'm thinking I had like frosting pants.",
    "Sounds like a.",
    "Well, the hang time that song.",
    "Feening",
    "OK, we're done.",
    "Starbucks out.",
    "So we start drawing the frosting and I haven't done goo in a really long time, so it's actually really exciting for me.",
    "'cause I love gooey things.",
    "A lot of layers going I draw layers initially I usually merge everything together when I get closer to actually coloring and filling in the illustration, but I like doing it this way in the beginning 'cause it gives me some flexibility and ease to like kind of go through and just adjust things.",
    "And it kind of gives me a little bit of some flexibility to draw through certain areas so that I can.",
    "What's it called?",
    "I can I can erase make really clean lines and stuff like that?",
    "Now I think what I want to do is this.",
    "Create some kind of.",
    "'cause it would be kind of like gross.",
    "Cross it would be kind of disgusting.",
    "Oh wait, I can actually draw right through this.",
    "Yeah yeah, that's my puppy frosting which I like.",
    "Sweet week would be cool.",
    "I think we just had national Donut Day a few days ago.",
    "Yeah, I think it just it just passed.",
    "They all do sweet week, we could just weeks that be fun.",
    "I've never really done like a themed week either.",
    "It's always like a character and we name it and then that kind of sets the theme I've never done like seeing.",
    "I don't want to call gimmicks, 'cause that's not what these are.",
    "I gotta go back.",
    "This isn't lining up, right?",
    "We gotta bring this down a little bit, so I think another layer.",
    "There we go.",
    "Yeah will do.",
    "It will do this week.",
    "Which is the next one?",
    "Be on Monday start.",
    "Start brainstorming now what was sweet item I should draw?",
    "And then we're going to have to ask you to remind me because I'll forget for being totally honest.",
    "All right, there we go.",
    "That's some slimy goo coming off this dude.",
    "Just pick a different layer so another one.",
    "There.",
    "There we go.",
    "Who?",
    "Now, noticing that.",
    "My frosting needs to be a separate the donut from the frosting, which I was kind of not doing so let's see here.",
    "But he's a frosting arm that would be cool like the arm was made of frosting.",
    "'cause this just looks cheesy.",
    "Like if I did that and that's like I didn't try.",
    "Jonah, go.",
    "That's still too much detail.",
    "Just leave it like that.",
    "There we go.",
    "National Donut day.",
    "With Friday OO fresh cake must make cheesecake that's what Anthony is looking for.",
    "I do like cheesecake alot, you know I don't like though is The Cheesecake Factory is not a fan.",
    "I think the menu is too complicated.",
    "This is a controversial topic.",
    "But they like people like you don't like you cake factory.",
    "What's wrong with you?",
    "I don't like Cheesecake factory for several reasons, and one of them is really stupid, but I think the menus really complicated.",
    "I've never had a good experience at Cheesecake Factory.",
    "And the biggest issue that I really have with Cheesecake Factory is that I don't like the branding.",
    "Let's just go through this.",
    "Let's see what other cool.",
    "Things are there, you can make materials so like using the Camera.",
    "You can take a picture or something and you can turn it into a 3D material for Adobe dimensions.",
    "I never use type.",
    "There's like this capture thing that you can take pictures and stuff like this shape here is.",
    "I took a picture of the boardwalk in Atlantic City and it converts.",
    "Oh no source image is not available.",
    "Maybe it's on this one.",
    "'cause apparently I did two of 'em No.",
    "No more source images.",
    "Sorry this is the boardwalk from Atlantic City.",
    "Yeah, I did a paint splatter.",
    "I took a picture of Instagram logo.",
    "'cause I need it.",
    "Some tattoo art that I found probably online.",
    "But then you can also make patterns.",
    "You can see like I took some of my characters and made these like wacky weird patterns out of this image here.",
    "So yeah, you could do some really cool stuff with this, it's a.",
    "It's a really rad rad app and then a lot of that stuff gets integrated often into the different you know Adobe apps.",
    "You can access those libraries from your desktop on photo shop all that kind of stuff.",
    "Yeah, highly recommend.",
    "So let's see.",

    "It just feels.",
    "Odd.",
    "You don't want to go back and we'll figure it out later.",
    "Kind of like the full like density of the beard.",
    "Something that's always kind of nice like in art and that I think everybody should always remember when you're drawing don't be afraid to just have like a large section of black space.",
    "Sometimes it kind of helps anchor your drawing and it kind of add something to it like I talked about this one of my previous streams.",
    "It might actually been the last time it might have been the holiday, when I did over Christmas but.",
    "When I was in Art School, something always did was take like a I think I have it one up here I do.",
    "Take a drawing sketch a bunch of stuff out and then like take areas and just fill them in with black to try to help kind of anchor stuff like I said earlier like kind of helps this is another good one got a nice explicit.",
    "If I'm here.",
    "But you might have already super tiny, but then I kind of failed in these little nubs.",

    "2 layer.",
    "Wait vector emerged so I started doing this, too recently.",
    "Merge down so I put a white solid behind and then.",
    "I lose kind of like the white on the outside of shapes now.",
    "This guys got like a fill so there, we go.",
    "We kind of go transparent.",
    "'Cause I started drawing in a lot of background kind of stuff and it's kind of nice to do what I just did because it makes it really easy to.",
    "To add in any kind of background elements.",
    "'cause now when I draw let's say get a black line here.",
    "Now, when I draw I can just draw right behind him and I have to worry about erasing anything, it's kind of nice.",
    "Let's see here I was trying to put something behind him.",
    "I don't know what to put behind him.",
    "Weird.",
    "Swirly kind of motion.",

    "Remember, how I said that I wanted to work on a different layer.",
    "I didn't take my own advice earlier an I merge all this stuff.",
    "To do the fill and then I added detail and now it's going to be a challenge when I want to swap stuff out not a problem.",
    "Will figure it out?",
    "Alright so let's see here.",
    "Let's take, will and Fred Let's take Fred here real quick.",
    "And it's the same thing.",
    "Here.",
    "Oh wait no, I don't want to add in.",
    "Like random lines 1st.",
    "So I don't know if this is like a fresco issue or if it's like an iPad thing or what's going on here?",
    "I'd love to hear if other people are having this problem that are using the same app as I am.",
    "Um.",
    "So we hit this and then you go to put it away.",
    "I always want to tap the pen stroke.",
    "To hide it and like it's working right now, but see right there and then sometimes it just flashes and comes right back up like it's doing right now, so I don't.",
    "I like a little annoying 'cause, it doesn't go away until I start drawing again.",
    "It's not like a make or break but it is.",

    "Then maybe on his belly.",
    "'Cause, like that would catch the light 'cause I could just out.",
    "So add highlights the same way.",
    "Actually, I don't think that we're losing highlights.",
    "I had highlights, though the same way, at shadows.",
    "A white and black and then opacity change it, you know, either raise it up or turn it down.",
    "Oh 'cause I have weights.",
    "Figure out what happened to my machining disappeared only.",
    "Let's see.",

    "Damn, I'm further thanks a lot of definitely probably know who he is if you're especially if you're here on Behance.",
    "Or if you're on Instagram or anything else and you follow art really talented artists anyway.",
    "I saw him doing this on a stream recently and I kind of thought in my head.",
    "I should probably do something similar.",
    "I think it was him that was doing it.",
    "I hope it was otherwise would be really awkward.",
    "If you saw this, it was like I don't do that at all.",
    "This guy made that up.",
    "Hum.",
    "So anyway that paint bucket.",
    "I'll start grabbing some colors here.",
    "Hello C, Oops.",
    "So one thing I hope fresco brings in is.",
    "What's it called?",
    "The CC libraries, 'cause I have a bunch of color palettes saved and I make them like all the time and I would love to be able to have access to those.",
    "And use them right here in Frisco and currently they don't.",
    "But I heard that they're coming so.",
    "You know keep your eyes peeled.",
    "I like this orange.",
    "Might change up my black lines on here into a fun color, but let's let's first get all the colors and then we want to use.",
    "It's too.",
    "Blue background black a darker blue.",
    "'Cause my background is darker.",

    "Things like that.",
    "Analysis let's go down my Rd.",
    "Who?",
    "So this is another home with Fresca that I don't understand why it's happening.",
    "But like I thought all these black.",
    "Like lines because we you know combined them would re merge them.",
    "Would recognize that they're all the same color and it kind of doesn't which is weird.",
    "But now that I've.",
    "Done this like 1 little bit in like an odd color pink if we go like this blue.",
    "And we do it, it'll recognize an kind of paint all of 'em.",
    "Let's lose that color in the background for right now.",
    "We get real experimental here.",
    "Let's get weird.",
    "Nice thing is this is like a simple drawing so we can get kind of crazy with it and let it go.",
    "I worry about you know.",
    "Oh, that's creepy it looks like some weird.",

    "What do you all think?",
    "I think it looks dope.",
    "Usually the powder Blues and powder pinks they kind of do it for me, but I usually have to have some other colors in there to help it along.",
    "But this one, I'm kind of digging.",
    "I know you're thinking like what you doing to get rid of it.",
    "Nope just making a shadow.",
    "New menu there, we go.",
    "Alright let's add a pixel brush just to it, you know, add some texture and a whole bunch of cool textures that I really like.",

    "You can literally tether your iPad to your thing and you can mirror your monitor and you can draw in illustrator everything with a pencil.",
    "Basically access in TI.",
    "So now I don't really feel the need to invest in one.",
    "Or you can get other third party apps that kind of do the same thing, but I've had a lot of luck with sidecar.",
    "I really enjoy it.",
    "Fever iPad think I mentioned at the beginning I use a six Gen iPad so a little old school I mean it's not like that old few years old but looking to upgrade pretty soon.",
    "I don't think I'm going to go pro.",

    "I do like the idea of.",
    "Like I don't know, I just.",
    "I like the idea of it being cheap, cheaper and cheaper option and I get a trade in value on this and I've got a gift card to Apple so I don't want to like.",
    "You know, I feel like.",
    "I'll bring the cost down quite a bit for Maine.",
    "I've had like $150 and I shouldn't say a gift card.",
    "I have several gift cards, have $150 in Apple gift cards, and I've been waiting for what I'm going to use it for, and I think I'm going to pull the trigger on an iPad airport with it.",
    "I think that's going to be the plan.",
    "Alright, so we're going to draw in the go ahead around.",

    "Something that I want to point out.",
    "You have the option to take the brush are currently using and convert it into an eraser by just having this little toggle and then in the new version when it comes out, if you drag down you convert it into this line to erase your stuff quickly so it's kind of fun.",

    "You know we should add in some of this sort of detail.",
    "Like in here.",
    "We also everyone our wish like.",
    "I feel like I'm going about this like I have a lot of confidence, but I'm looking at it right now.",
    "I don't know what I'm doing.",
    "It's a good one.",
    "OK, I'm gonna check it out.",

    "Getting this out.",
    "It's hard to decide.",
    "You have to pick Sam.",
    "Now Sam, your favorite Pok\u00e9mon that counts.",
    "Also, I had this really bizarre like debate with myself along time ago, 'cause I thought Aeon flux was an anime.",
    "Simply basing that on the House animated, I'm going to be honest, but I don't think it is.",
    "Who is the creator from my California?",
    "Also fun fact they do.",
    "That made aeon flux also makes Rugrats so.",
    "Some more cartoon knowledge bombs for everybody.",
    "Favorite anime is probably full metal Alchemist Brotherhood.",
    "Fullmetal alchemist is awesome.",
    "I've never actually fully watched or finish the entire series, but from what I have seen, it's really really good.",
    "Alright, let's let's start coloring this dude, and then we'll add some detail and you know the whole thing looks really cool.",
    "Alright, move that way.",
    "For color, let's start out with.",
    "Here, let's do this.",
    "Let's do a couple things.",
    "Let's make a new layer.",
    "Let's grab the color white.",
    "NASA, Phyllis in no way to color.",
    "The absence of color.",
    "Wasn't light then.",
    "It's all the colors combined.",
    "Whatever pick white and film background or Gray or whatever you want does matter.",
    "Merge down and then let's shut off this background layer and then we're going to take the paint bucket still selected.",
    "We're going to hit a little toggle.",
    "We're going to tap.",
    "Oh whoops, we have our layer selected where tap we're going to create an Alpha out of this.",
    "Just get rid of that stuff so we can properly see you know the scene.",
    "Let's make a new layer and let's pick A.",
    "We don't need a background color yet to turn that back on.",
    "Turn on the background.",
    "Alright, let's now the reason why did that is 'cause when I start adding in a background color like let's say.",
    "This color here.",
    "Our character will still have, you know.",
    "Some kind of fill to it, so we're not just looking through the background color, just seeing Linework Rugrats.",
    "Really, yes.",
    "Yep, they do.",
    "That made aeon flux made Rugrats, which is super weird when when you like.",
    "Think about that for a minute.",
    "'cause like that shows are very different.",
    "But now that you know that, watch like one episode or like just look at some images.",
    "Going to watch episodes.",
    "What one episode of each on a TV next to each other and watch Movies Now that you know that if you look at some images though from the shows, you'll see the similarities.",
    "Oh thanks so much Sarah.",
    "Appreciate it.",
    "Just now I watch everything OK, fair enough.",
    "Alright, so.",
    "I like that color for the background.",
    "Let's go to my colors are also in fresco.",
    "If you hit recent under your color, you have your like you know your color wheel and you can.",
    "You know HSV sliders and everything else.",
    "But if you go to your if you go to the tablets is alittle access your CC library.",
    "So if you use the Adobe creative cloud and you're not utilizing CC a whole lot you should start because all that stuff port through to pretty much all the apps you can make really cool stuff like the full category, have club colors rule with a whole bunch of fun colors.",
    "Some of these I've made I've been on like a red cake.",
    "Very excuse me.",
    "Little bit alright cake clearly, but you can create some really cool color palettes like.",
    "Actually, this is kind of fun.",
    "Hold on.",
    "And you can use them just by selecting them and then you know happen to fill stuff in.",
    "Let's pick a line.",
    "Let's pick a color for line work and let's.",
    "Let's see what do I do here?",
    "This is the other thing.",
    "Now 'cause Elvis or else is the eldest.",
    "I feel like that's how it said anyway.",
    "Something that's really weird with the whole like Yes, you can draw pasture artboard, but when you feel things in it doesn't fill past the art board.",
    "I don't know why fresco does that, it's very odd.",
    "I don't know why I didn't just fill all this stuff in to begin with, but it's all good.",
    "Hi.",
    "That's looking kinda cool actually.",
    "I like that color.",
    "Very designer of me, but let me explain.",
    "What is cheesecake factory?",
    "If, like Willy Wonka met Tuscan Villa, this is not a design like this is ridiculous in there can't do it and then the cocktail table salt, sugar in Nancy.",

    "I'm going to redo that one.",
    "Let's go back quite a bit here.",
    "Let's get rid of this guy.",
    "I'm going to be honest with everybody.",
    "I really thought I was going to get a bigger rise out of the chat, like immediately about my cheesecake factory.",
    "Not liking.",
    "Does anyone else not like Cheesecake Factory?",
    "Might not alone.",
    "I feel like there's a lot of brands like that that kind of have a misleading name, but different services.",
    "Yeah, I mean you get cheesecake from Cheesecake Factory.",
    "But yeah, that's like.",
    "There's a lot of people rave about the Mac and cheese.",
    "The Cheesecake Factory like that's like really likes their Mac and cheese is so good.",
    "Alright, let me see here.",
    "This is just not adding up for me right now.",
    "We get rid of these lines.",
    "More looking at this, I kind of feel like the back part of the Donuts back here like in this area.",
    "Here and then this part down here is just kind of the frosting drip that's now kind of hanging out, so let's leave that where it is right now.",
    "Go up here.",
    "Still a little bit of something like this.",
    "Definitely not my favorite.",
    "Alright, we gotta we got yeah.",
    "Rage Against Cheesecake Factory.",
    "So we actually just turned in was like.",
    "Why is This guy got such a hatred for Cheesecake Factory?",
    "'cause they're branding is making sense.",
    "Don't understand what it is.",
    "I guess we watch a show bar rescue with Jon Taffer.",
    "Every Russian he goes into he's always like like the man you've got too much stuff.",
    "Now I know it's reality TV so like this is a terrible thing to base anything on.",
    "But he's always like look you got too much stuff on the menu you gotta limit.",

    "Yeah, sometimes we saw cheesecake.",
    "When I first walked into one, I thought a cheesecake had exploded all over the walls.",
    "Oh, maybe that's what the branding is like.",
    "Somebody like a boardroom swimsuit was like, alright.",
    "Here's a brief for Cheesecake Factory.",
    "Branding and design.",
    "I want to be like I walked into a piece of cheesecake.",
    "So like interior designer was like Alright, I guess I'll just.",
    "Guess I'll just take all these gold paint and all the reject items we can find in like the TJ Maxx Discount I'll.",
    "Put together cheesecake factory.",
    "The Cheesecake Factory is like.",
    "Cheesecake factory is like the hot pocket of like chain restaurants.",
    "I don't know what that analogy means.",
    "So.",
    "So we went to notice.",
    "I paint right off the canvas.",
    "I always encourage that with anyone I talked to about making art.",
    "Extend your lines like that stuff, going to cut off anyway.",
    "When you export.",
    "It's going to make cleaner lines going to look better.",
    "Don't be afraid to draw off of the area that you kind of set for yourself, you know, I've seen people far too often try to like get really granular with it and they're like.",
    "In there like drawn right up to the line and imitating it right now like I'm doing it, I'm not.",
    "Right.",
    "You know it's you don't need to do that.",
    "I say draw over the line draw outside the canvas think outside the box.",
    "You know.",
    "Extender work.",
    "You have a more complete looking piece when you're done.",
    "OK.",
    "Set up here.",
    "I thought I did.",
    "Just notice I accidentally made a little random dot down there.",
    "OK, cool so.",
    "That some guys there hanging out.",
    "Guess I should shave this side of the students face.",
    "Make it make sense and everything else right.",
    "Let's hear let's turn on pressure dynamics.",
    "Slime.",
    "Like.",
    "Jimmy Fallon does that one character.",
    "Like out.",
    "Sweet and let's finish this up so shut the shading here.",
    "I'm just going to come from down here.",
    "Go right up through this guys lips.",
    "No, we're not that's too far.",
    "Great underneath that I.",
    "Latin.",
    "Trace back over this line so that we can close it up.",
    "Who got one off a little bit all good?",
    "We're going to fill?",
    "Now it looks terrible.",
    "Not sure do it.",
    "Again big part of this is just experimenting and figuring out what works.",
    "There's no right or wrong way to do it.",
    "It's kind of fun.",
    "Cool.",
    "Alright let's add some shading in here.",
    "Just looked up the stream notice we got some new people watching.",
    "You know if you're new.",
    "You're hanging out if your new follower mine if you're just.",
    "And I'm here just in Behance and saw that there is a live stream of fresco going on and want to watch see what it's all about feel free to ask questions.",
    "I use fresco.",

    "Uh.",
    "Be happy to answer any questions, you just hop right in the chat should be either under the video or next to it.",
    "We can talk shop and yeah.",
    "Just kind of getting creative over here.",
    "No real plan.",
    "I want to turn this into a comic strip.",
    "I have some ideas of what they're going to be talking about.",
    "But I'm not going to give that stuff away just yet.",
    "However, you want to think of this line.",
    "Oof.",
    "However, I'm going to show you how much I make my panels out of these guys.",
    "After I find a way to make this line nice and straight.",
    "Up the ruler talk loud.",
    "I'm better than that.",
    "Works for me.",
    "Oh, wow, wow wow.",
    "Let me do it here.",
    "There we go.",
    "Can I do it on this one like just freehand it?",
    "Yeah.",
    "You really zoom in on the piece you wanna see that close whatever more power to you.",
    "Let's see all those are my favorites.",
    "Where are my manga ones or manga?",
    "Or, however, you say it unless you know comics now?",
    "There we go down the bottom let's grab.",
    "Action lines Oh yeah, these are kind of cool.",
    "That's awesome.",
    "There you go just adds a little something to it, you know.",
    "Go here take it a little bit.",
    "And.",
    "Yeah, let's do this duplicate this layer.",
    "Go here.",
    "Get the color white.",
    "Get the paint bucket filling your dude.",
    "And let's go to click here and click mask layer contents.",
    "Convert it over to pixel layer because we want this to be would have amassed player.",
    "So we can draw on it, and not have our drawing go outside the mask.",
    "So swipe it over to the right.",
    "It go here transfer mode and hit multiply.",
    "OO now we got like a darker kind of purple to from that.",
    "'Cause the Blues are you know it's the blend mode, it's kind of neat.",
    "And let's go here and here you know what let's.",
    "Let's hide this really quick let's get this color.",
    "As we need it turned it back on.",
    "And let's.",
    "Let's grab.",
    "Let's grab dumbbell.",
    "So let's just pulling a nice kind of I don't know have Tony texture on this guys face.",
    "Just kind of get some grit.",
    "Oops.",
    "Little finicky like it.",
    "So again the the way that I'm able to do this is 'cause of that blend mode that I just selected.",
    "That kind of ads like a little bit of A.",
    "Let's turn down the Opacity.",
    "Because it's just the ability to add some detail.",
    "And with clean up in the I don't know if I.",
    "Let's go back go back go back go back.",
    "And go back with more.",
    "Way back to before.",
    "There we go.",
    "Let's go through the ice covered the teeth.",
    "Now let's do it.",
    "Best web content convert.",
    "So the reason why I went back just now like that is because I wanted to.",
    "I want to poop.",
    "Remove.",
    "Go ahead and remove all the teeth.",
    "I want to create a mask layer.",
    "I don't want it on the eyes are the teeth.",
    "So I'm going to remove those sections of color, so that when I create them.",
    "It identifies that just the areas that are filled in.",
    "Now we want to hear blend mode multiply.",
    "And we grab our pixel brush, which we already have selected.",
    "And we're going to paint the texture back in something.",
    "So just kind of lightly touching here.",
    "Too much pressure it's very sensitive.",
    "I just want like a light texture.",
    "I want to do too much.",
    "There we go.",
    "Just kind of grit, it up a little bit.",
    "Make a new layer let's see I'm going to layer grab.",
    "Color you like.",
    "I'm gonna grab this blue because I'm going to make shadows.",
    "So new layer.",
    "Turn down the opacity too.",
    "I don't know.",
    "And grab power vector brush.",
    "Painting some shadows.",
    "That.",
    "Both teeth on the I.",
    "Cool.",
    "I think I'm going to turn it down little bit more.",
    "Just a little bit so little shadow nothing crazy, maybe too much too low.",
    "There we go.",
    "Maple it in the year.",
    "Why did the natural thought I had the paint bucket selected shoot?",
    "I just fill this in I totally did.",
    "Back up.",
    "Come on.",
    "There we go there, we go a little bit on the ear.",
    "Yeah, see, that's the other thing.",
    "If I get the iPad pro I want to get the 12 inch or they can almost 13 I think is huge.",

    "OK.",
    "Why is it not?",
    "OK, this is going to be weird.",
    "So why does the ruler not want me to use my pressure sensitivity?",
    "Interesting.",
    "I think I found a bug.",
    "Maybe it does, but like it starts it out wicked thick.",
    "Doesn't like start really thin?",
    "OK.",
    "Right, let's experiment already.",
    "That's super weird outfit.",

    "All right, uh, that looks stupid now.",
    "I kind of like it, but like who?",
    "Who does this with their hand?",
    "This guy, that's who.",
    "These figures are not adding up whatever he's got two different hands.",
    "He's kind of a monster, so who cares?",

    "I'm going to be very disappointed.",
    "Hey Siri, set a reminder.",
    "I want to forget.",
    "And party on dudes.",
    "Um?",
    "I have a buddy who is a total space cadet.",
    "And Bill and Ted.",
    "I think one of the reasons why I like Bill and Ted is 'cause I see a lot of how the two of us grew up in Bill and Ted.",
    "And.",
    "Last night were watching my wife immediately asked me.",
    "She goes.",
    "So which one were you with?",

    "I just don't know what.",
    "Will figure it out.",
    "Alright, so do they are going to make a new layer to lower the opacity down to like I don't know 8 just for now we're just going to crude like super crudely put in some shapes.",
    "Let's see here.",
    "Let's razor brush level up actually quite a bit.",
    "No.",
    "Yeah, let's do this.",
    "This now the reason why I'm doing the opacity down like super low so that I can actually see where.",
    "So actually, if you are in place in my lines.",
    "For now, we're going to fill it all in.",
    "And then we can turn it up.",
    "Say like this little area here, I turn it down to low.",
    "I should have picked it up like yeah closer or whatever.",

    "Oops, I like I I go between different color palettes like all the time.",
    "Sometimes things are very like vibrant and then other times are like way more like subdued and it's really funny because if you look at my IG account right now, like at eat fresh cake, that's not handled by the way.",
    "If anyone wants to follow.",
    "If you look at it right now, it's very like it's very like pink and blue and there's a lot of pastel colors going on.",
    "I'm like really leaning this.",
    "I love denim color like I don't know that.",
    "This is a fun color palette.",

    "And I didn't just study illustration.",
    "Also studied broadcast media or broadcast and digital media production and so.",
    "Well, I'm telling you that is because I had to take a lot of really cool classes that involve cameras and lights and all these other things in our project.",

    "Now I thought I went to night shift mode.",
    "I got really nervous there for a second, 'cause that's happened in the past and I'm not picking colors and then I gotta shut that off and then all of a sudden I realized that like I'm not looking at the right color space.",
    "This is how I feel.",
    "Alright, so let's shrink down this line a little bit.",
    "Say that like 13.",
    "Because yeah, it's the back leg.",

    "I'm just going to.",
    "I'm going to merge everything together, take some risks, live on the edge.",
    "It's digital art.",
    "We can go back and we need to.",
    "Well, sometimes put it all in a group, is a lot faster than doing this, so let's make that happen.",
    "This just grab all these things.",
    "Right back on that.",
    "That So you can group in fresco.",
    "It's really easy, just grab something, drag it over top of another layer.",
    "It will make a group and then from there you can take these groups.",
    "This app on him emerge layers in Group.",
    "And.",
    "Emerged out.",
    "Like some new colors, some let's add some color to this, let's do something fun.",

    "You know, and like you bring in like a cmyk file into like a RGB wow.",
    "This conversation is getting dirty.",
    "But you bring like a CMYK filing like in RGB space in the Black is like a little bit of an off Gray.",
    "I think that's what I'm like running into right now.",
    "Weird custom create some cool effects, though kind of into it.",
    "All right, so we're currently making this whole guy orange.",
    "Alright I want to assure everyone usually there's a more efficient way than this don't know why all my linework got all wonky someone to look into that.",
    "So is that perfect round.",
    "So the way to find some imperfections, though.",
    "These like little guys like this thing like random tiny shape.",
    "Or that this one right here.",

    "I get asked people always hit me up.",
    "Dude, you should make a video game and I'm like well that's really hard.",
    "And be like.",

    "I'm waiting for like the day that she's like, well, dad, you swear I'll be like honey.",
    "If I don't swear my head will explode like that should be fine equation for why I do it and you wouldn't want that.",
    "Alright, so Thomas, where we're adding detail to this illustration, FYI, in case you didn't know that.",
    "So at a whole bunch of like fun like goo.",
    "Kind of, I think it's unanimous we're going with these colors, so that's what we're going to roll with.",
    "I'm going to fill the octopus in with something, but will get there.",
    "We ain't there yet.",
    "So where am I?",
    "People who swear the best Tiffany honest OK Alright So Course Wow.",

    "Let's start cursing all wow.",
    "Pretty ceiling fan.",
    "Alright, let's uh, let's see here we got.",
    "I never realized you could fill an open vector shape if it touches the edge of the Artboard.",
    "did I do that?",
    "Wait like Daniel, you talking like this like if I fill this in it will do like that again in fact, but again it creates it like a treat it like it's a different image.",
    "That merges it with the below layer.",
    "The cake donut needs some sprinkles.",
    "Yeah, we're gonna have some wrinkles on the donut for sure.",
    "They're kind of in there in the rough sketch on him right there.",
    "But we're going to 1st do some, some fill color and stuff like that just to kind of get a base set for this character.",
    "I want to grab the color white, but the tap and hold feature doesn't seem to work right now, so it's still here will make her background white.",
    "We are going to merge down were shut off this bottom layer and they weren't at this little icon.",
    "Whenever layer selected web tap outside so we can see our transparency tap right there, get rid of that.",
    "Go up so we got kind of like the rough line work of the Donut man drawn out.",
    "Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to start adding in some detail.",
    "To the character, just kind of adding some little somebody wants told me it's flavoring the drawing, which I thought was really creative.",
    "We had some stuff about some drift were not sold.",
    "Donut holes in the floor.",
    "I'm going to whole lot of stuff to this really kind of round out, but this is kind of like the basic starting point, so let's put in our.",
    "Singer actually you know what?",
    "Let's do this.",
    "Let's do some color work first, because I don't know if I want to change my linework color to something different, and I don't feel like adding it a bunch of detail and changing it all later.",
    "So let's add some color.",
    "Let's see.",
    "So donut would be something like a toasty.",
    "Golden Brown kind of color.",
    "Oops.",
    "Actually, you know what's the background first?",
    "Thanks.",
    "So that in the bank I just like pink.",
    "It will be like a blue 'cause will do a pink frosting.",
    "Those will complement each other really nicely.",
    "And let's go deep purple for the line work.",
    "Oops.",
    "Is it cool?",
    "Looking good.",
    "Maybe bring it up just a little bit.",
    "See a little more of that purple.",
    "No more of the purple tone.",
    "Oh yeah, rocking and rolling.",

    "They were smaller than I had it, you know.",
    "And the colours turned up or anything.",
    "Alright, let's have some detail really quick before I go too far.",
    "So something I want to add.",
    "Well, I had some drips.",
    "Donut drips if you will.",
    "So now it looks creepy.",
    "I should kind of like just the two were kind of nice.",
    "Maybe it's hot where there's Donuts walking, you know.",
    "Just a stupid little question.",
    "What application are you on your iPad fresco?",
    "Yes I am that is sorry I missed that question I am on.",
    "I'm using Adobe fresco on and six Gen iPad with only 32 gigs of memory.",
    "If anyone's curious is the tools that I use, I do write them in the description below so check it out.",
    "But also don't hesitate to ask in the chat.",
    "Yeah sorry it took me a minute to get back to your question.",
    "I saw the chocolate wine comment and I missed it.",
    "Just so fascinated by this chocolate.",
    "Delicious.",
    "All right?",

    "Alright, well, we lost, we forgot this eyeball alright so we got this giant orange head that I finally filled in were finally finishing up that took way longer than I would have liked to all right there, we go cool no giant Orange Dome.",
    "Let's add some here let's.",
    "She's layers into a group that a background color.",
    "Ooh forgot we had some like White in here.",
    "Oops.",
    "Alright cool, then let's see.",
    "Don't know hoops, they need to do I did so, if you tap and hold by the way on the screen?",
    "You can.",
    "You can select like a color just.",
    "'Cause we want that like orange that we used for the head to quick way to do it.",
    "That's a few spots.",
    "See that's why I need that game.",
    "I'm going to clean up my work for me.",
    "Right let's find some fun colors lately.",
    "I've kind of been on this like I don't wanna say.",
    "Monochromatic 'cause That's definitely not what this is, but like a kick of like Oh that's weird.",
    "Uh.",
    "Definitely gonna kick of like kind of working with all warm tones like.",
    "Like all these like pinks.",
    "It's actually kinda cool kinda like this, or we might be on to something here.",
    "Pretty rad.",
    "Digging that.",
    "All right.",
    "Little later here.",
    "You know if I like that.",
    "The same either.",
    "Hum.",
    "This is the fun part just like exploring colors, you know.",
    "But it was not a color suggestion be more than happy to hear it.",
    "Shout out that you want me to add to this piece will drop it in see what it looks like.",
    "Like right now, I'm thinking, maybe there's a nice shade of blue also something cool.",
    "Like I should mention fresco saves all your like colors and Oh wow.",
    "What OK I'd never even thought to click here.",
    "If you go to like I'm a library called colors rule with like every color palette ever.",
    "You can then click on those and you can go through and pick like this is all like so in Adobe capture.",
    "I'm getting super excited right now, so I'm like jumping through my sentence in Adobe capture if you captured some cool colors from an image.",
    "They would show up here and then you can use them in your piece so like I really like like all these libraries because these are all just sometimes I just sit in like?",
    "On Adobe just make color palettes.",
    "Let's just start like mixing matching these 'cause.",
    "I like that.",
    "Pink a lot, but let's see what happens if you change the background.",
    "Let's hurt my eyeballs.",
    "That's cool.",
    "OK, OK.",
    "Get behind that.",
    "Nope.",
    "Can you get behind that Nope can't get behind that either?",
    "We got Back.",
    "I feel like the only spot to really add like some serious like.",
    "Pop too.",
    "So, like outside shape I created.",
    "2nd.",
    "Like the original.",
    "Wanna fill this guys face in weight?",
    "Apostrophe.",
    "That's cool.",
    "See this is always the best part and you start exploring stuff.",
    "We think pink.",
    "From Blue.",
    "Pink.",
    "Blue let me know whenever you guys pick will keep.",
    "Are purple?",
    "Come over here.",
    "Tiny face Oh, he had like a chin earlier, see that's why we did this, because in comics is always hard to maintain like consistency 'cause you forget.",
    "Or at least I forget.",
    "I'm sure people who draw comics regularly.",
    "All sorts of tips and tricks to avoid that but I know alright so there.",
    "Now we have our other panel.",
    "Or second panel if you will going to save out.",
    "Go back to this panel whoops, Nope don't open that.",
    "Duplicate.",
    "Apparently my syncing is not syncing, but that's OK.",
    "And again we're going to repeat that same process so we're going to actually hide this, dude now.",
    "And we're going to grab this guy.",
    "We're going to.",
    "Elect him or blow him up now.",
    "Play some big.",
    "You know it will fill the frame with them.",
    "Maybe take its cut off.",
    "It's 1 less thing about vectors.",
    "You can just like scale am infinitely you can do whatever you want with it really.",
    "We also worry about things being you know perfect.",
    "And this, dude kinda has he was going to have.",
    "Life advice.",
    "Kind of the angle I was going to take.",
    "There.",
    "And.",
    "Now let's redraw his mouth.",
    "There wasn't much shading going on it or anything, so will be super quick.",
    "Boat.",
    "I can't remember.",
    "The hell is that?",
    "Big brush.",
    "We're doing strictly vector on this one.",
    "All right, so we're going to draw a mouth real fast.",
    "Real quick math, let's see what does he's giving advice so his mouth might look something like?",
    "We had some teeth.",
    "So my teeth are pretty simple.",
    "For my other streams you know they're just little half circles that overlap.",
    "Or not even half circles are like little quarter circles.",
    "Something kind of like this.",
    "Wait.",
    "OK, I don't know what I just did.",
    "That was weird as not his mouth look like before.",
    "Let's see here.",
    "Now I just Jack this up.",
    "They look terrible.",
    "Samarasinghe.",
    "Oh boy.",

    "Hum.",
    "Take me to do that let's just.",
    "Probably know what I want this mouth look like.",
    "I should be open 'cause, he's talking.",
    "You know what?",
    "Siskey, but we had resumed in why not?",
    "Why fix something that you know it's not broken?",
    "So, in any case, if we go back here whoops.",
    "If we go back to the home page.",
    "You'll notice at the Top of my saved documents there's a whole bunch.",
    "Of it will be the three panels.",
    "Scroll down these 3 panels at the Top here.",
    "Underneath where it says cloud document sort by date modified or go back to home.",
    "It'll be better.",
    "Those are my 3 panels to my comic and it was really quick to do.",
    "By just drawing extreme for maybe an hour.",
    "I think I came into this kind of started a little bit of it already before I started streaming so if you go back and watch a replay you'll notice.",
    "That you know it had kind of already been partially you know on its way.",
    "But it really.",
    "I did most of this in under an hour and a half.",
    "We got 3 solid panels.",
    "I'm going to be able to drop some speech balloons in there now actually tell a story.",
    "I do have a story written out by the way for this.",
    "It's not just something that I like made up.",
    "I'm on the spot, it's not that I was making random panels.",
    "But by drawing each character individually putting them in their own groups.",
    "I was able to quickly create more panels.",
    "If you if for some reason like your Internet decided to turn into a potato and stop working on you for a second or anything like that.",
    "So if for whatever reason you feel like maybe I'm not answering your question and I do have a lag, I want to point that out there so it will just start hitting it 'cause you're like.",
    "I'm chatting with him and he's not responding.",
    "You know?",
    "Is it possible that a I missed it for starters, so I apologize B.",
    "It's possible that you know I'm lagged out and you're ahead of me, or I'm sorry you're behind me and or you're just not watching live and you should hit that little button so you can tune in an catch it as it's happening.",
    "Who got began like you've got some cloud feed that put in the back is making no sense.",
    "Flower, maybe?",
    "God distance.",
    "Let's just leave it where it is.",
    "Radio Then again, I bought his by the fire hydrant in the bottom left of your screen.",
    "You're trying to play catch up.",
    "You ruined it.",
    "You ruined me thinking of their names.",
    "I had log Spec Tations for Pikachu, but actually really enjoyed it.",
    "Wow, wow, OK I have to.",

    "Love to hear him.",
    "So far we've got Tony Honey Let's.",
    "So that's you know that's what we got this we got going on out there.",
    "Like how do you talking about those ever brought like a body part into the name of the character only before and all my characters have big giant tongues, so Tony Dungy seems fitting, you know?",
    "If you are new and watching it just looked up and saw, there's quite a few people viewing right now please.",
    "Feel free to say hello.",
    "In the chat.",
    "I'd love to give you a warm, fresh cake welcome and I'm sure the regulars would love to give you welcome as well.",

    "Once merge all these little less merged together.",
    "Let's just make some commitments.",
    "You know, bravery test as.",
    "Bob Ross who put it?",
    "But this is digital, so we do once.",
    "I really thought that brief, it's just me hitting delete.",
    "And then rejoin.",
    "Something crazy?",
    "That in a little wrinkle in the arm there.",
    "Alright, so let's make a new layer and let's lower down the Opacity so we could do the hair and let's turn up our brush size quite a bit.",
    "I said quite a bit, not two points.",
    "So let's do this, Mohawk.",
    "Is anyone out there that's watching using fresco?",
    "Currently, I'd love to hear your reactions on it and also if you have any ideas as to features that you'd like to see added, please let me know.",
    "Either they're being added or they're going to be added, or.",

    "But first let's.",
    "Turn up the Opacity back to 100 and proof so the only reason why I turned down the opacity I want to point this out really quick so that I can see where like my eyebrow isn't things since my hair is always the same color so I can erase that stuff easily since my hair is typically the same color as my line work, I don't really ever do different colored hair.",

    "I color like it needs to be something different hospitals and Blues earlier, which I kind of liked but it wasn't getting anywhere.",
    "Maybe later.",
    "I did it the way I did it with the shading because now I can go in an I can tap and fill in these things like that's cool to any color.",
    "I want and it maintains that shading like I'm going to make this orange.",
    "I still have that shade so that's why shade the way I do.",
    "'cause then it makes it really quick for when I want to like swap out stuff that's really poor example.",
    "But let's say wanna make this speech down.",

    "This fresco make the time lapse.",
    "I'm interested in learning how to share my drawing process.",
    "Yes, it does.",
    "It just basically just records what I'm drawing while I'm doing it, and then it processes that turns it into that on its own.",
    "I do literally nothing to create those time lapses.",
    "Except for draw the art, that's the part that I do.",
    "Everything else is done right here in Frisco.",
    "Which is nice 'cause it makes it really easy.",
    "And it's a cool piece of content.",
    "You know, like it's a really fun thing to share.",
    "I got into it 'cause I was like way old school with my sharing of Timelapses where I used to like you know screen record and then I'd edit it and then they added that feature with I think Adobe draws where popped in.",
    "Lisa might be where I first saw it.",
    "Um?",
    "And then that changed everything.",
    "Alright, so Matthew since you're the floor expert here, what kind of flora would you say this looks like?",
    "Weird flora outside.",
    "Flora ticket word that comes off my tongue well.",
    "Alright, let's get a purple back.",

    "And So what I'm using what I'm drawing on.",
    "There's some stuff in the description below.",
    "You can definitely check that out.",
    "I hate this blob that I made somewhere to lose that.",
    "But this is Adobe fresco.",
    "It is a drawing app by Adobe.",
    "You can get on the App Store on all your devices like tablet devices.",
    "I should say I don't think you can get on the phone.",
    "Crazy.",
    "Let me super hard to draw that.",
    "But there's people out there, I think they do it.",
    "Let's see here inside this thing in an let's.",
    "Deep.",
    "Well, it was still there, yeah?",
    "Wanna fix this shoe line?",
    "Oh yeah, what are names?",
    "We got Tony something or other names and ice or ornamental grass for Tony, Tony, Tony.",
    "That's right, you walk in the forest.",
    "Yeah, that there's ornamental grass in this forest.",
    "Look at this.",
    "Peace here.",
    "Like this should overlap the tell a little bit 'cause I don't want people to be like I stepped on that grass not in front of his foot.",
    "That's all.",
    "Everyone chill out.",
    "Tony then step on any rest.",
    "Let's color in this guy.",
    "Let's let's make a new layer to make it white.",
    "Let's merge down and it was just tap here with the paint bucket selected list app outside.",
    "Let's remove some of that background.",
    "So the reason why I'm doing this is so I can fill in the character quickly with just just to fill so I can put things behind them and do all sorts of cool stuff.",
    "Got the character of shrink down.",
    "Like the perspective of this one, I don't like what's going on right here, but I'm also just going to not care.",
    "Black, let's yeah the spot right here is kind of bugging me, but whatever we could do something like.",
    "Would try to add in maybe?",
    "Hold on.",
    "Let's make a new layer.",
    "There we go.",

    "I've not seen that yet.",
    "Originally streaming service, but I think Disney is just acquiring that.",
    "Is this is Disney acquiring DC?",
    "I did not know that, but it's crazy heavy.",
    "I DK if I can watch the whole thing but all their powers are related to trauma.",
    "OK, cool, that sounds quite interesting case.",
    "I want to check that out.",
    "Alright, let's let's add a background color in, so let's see here.",
    "So the favorite part is fine.",
    "Some colors let me do pink.",
    "Now know what tonight.",
    "Let's go to my colors rule.",
    "So something I want to point out about Adobe fresco.",
    "If you tap the color we got the color wheel right here and you got your HSV sliders.",
    "But if you go to all in recent's side that you can select from your CC library and I have, I think you got fresco colors which are just some random colors fresco.",
    "But I have a library called colors with a whole bunch of colors in it.",
    "Give me a definitive microphone.",
    "Apologize lab pizza.",
    "Well, it's not coming up.",
    "Fast.",
    "Imagine having that power from the do two in the comic and eating like pizza will be the worst thing for him to eat.",
    "What do you think would give him the worst like?",
    "I would give chew.",
    "The worst visions.",
    "Like I'm gonna say, scrap if you don't know it, scrapple is it's basically Pennsylvania Dutch dish that I love it is delicious for starters.",
    "Don't put that out there, but it's Pennsylvania Dutch dish.",
    "Where it's basically just like ground up pig, not like sausage wise, like I mean it's like all the other stuff that didn't make it and they season.",
    "It sounds disgusting when you're cleaning people.",
    "Flower.",
    "Now I guess.",
    "Alright, let's see what we got for colors here.",
    "Got something kind of cool happening?",
    "Maybe I don't know.",
    "Fully thinking what are we thinking?",
    "If we come up with a name for the character too, I don't think we don't think we had that yet.",
    "Let's see who never use this color palette before, but it looks awesome.",
    "Super red, actually.",
    "This could be kind of cool, hold on.",
    "Nothing like that maroon color.",
    "Who?",
    "I don't like the linework color, but hold on.",
    "This is how you find the good ones.",
    "Sorry it's on HBO, not Disney plus OK, that explains it.",
    "So have HBO.",
    "I didn't use the DC app though, for a little bit.",
    "I actually really enjoyed.",
    "It is really cool.",
    "Feel like re comic books and do all sorts of fun stuff.",
    "I think in the game I'm like nearing the end and I've been prolonging until my daughter goes best I can beat it tonight 'cause.",
    "Famous so.",
    "Damn long, Oh my God, it's like brutal.",
    "I came here to relax 'cause my heart was about 6 lug all your in Hillcrest at like 12 or 13 hours in my friend beat the whole game in 27 but I'm playing survivor.",
    "OK yeah I'm on your friends level.",
    "I'm going for like a 25 hour playthrough.",
    "Sound like that whatever the minimum is.",
    "I was on my way.",
    "Oh what's going on in you in.",
    "I was going.",
    "He thinks it's going to take.",
    "Yeah might take you.",
    "One of my friends is it did what you're doing.",
    "I think it took him like roughly 40.",
    "Maybe like in the 30s.",
    "Somewhere in the 30s I think is very finished out.",
    "I'm.",
    "I am I was going for the long run a matter fact.",
    "It's funny that you're in Hillcrest, 'cause when I was in the Hillcrest level Is really what I was like really exploring in like going into every building and making sure I didn't miss anything and then somewhere in the game my pace changed drastically and I started just sprinting through levels.",
    "I was like I can't do this.",
    "I need to know what happens next in the story is a very intense game like like.",
    "If anyone is playing it out there, yeah, it'll make you feel thanks for sure.",
    "I just got here we go.",
    "What difficulty you plan on?",
    "I'll be totally honest with you.",
    "I am playing it on like like a noob.",
    "The reason why I'm playing it on light though is because I want to actually enjoy the story and I have a daughter and she wakes up from Naps and cries and does all sorts of things.",
    "I'm saying excuses to be honest with you.",
    "I probably could have up the challenge level a little bit.",
    "But I'm playing a light because.",
    "I'm scared now I'm playing I'm playing like 'cause I can't just like sit down and like focus and grind away at a level like if I played on anything harder I would never beat the game 'cause I get interrupted every so often 'cause I have to be dad.",
    "And.",
    "So that's Why.",
    "Very selective what games I up the difficulty on.",
    "I couldn't play a game on survivor, though I wouldn't make it.",
    "How's your daughter mind 3 mine is 8 months.",
    "You showed me up with a daughter thinks you're like I got a kid too haha.",
    "I'm playing on difficult.",
    "You could blame other hand coworker I I no longer thank you, put me on a Dark Souls.",
    "My life hasn't been the same since.",
    "We play the misery.",
    "Well, it's funny.",
    "The irony is that he never beat Dark Souls, even wow.",
    "Yeah, I'm uh, I'm not one for grinding either.",
    "Like like I enjoy the story a lot in games and so I'll happily play 2 on an easier difficulty if it means I get to just like really kind of focus and enjoy the story more.",
    "This is not a lot of like bubbles.",
    "Never had a chance to play it.",
    "You never even played the original.",
    "The first one.",
    "I'm saying like I'd remain, it is better.",
    "Right now I'm learning this bubble here.",
    "Doesn't make any sense 'cause.",
    "Doesn't do anything for me.",
    "Hum.",
    "Yeah, I, uh.",
    "I like I.",
    "I'm going to be honest playing this game.",
    "It's funny talking about this playing this game on.",
    "On light or easy.",
    "Is making me want to play games on easy, more 'cause I'm just kind of like well I like going through level like I'm not in it for.",
    "Like I'm not like trying to like up my KD score anything.",
    "I'm just kind of like OK, I'm here to enjoy it.",
    "I'm not going to convert you Dave the other side I like now.",
    "Did you start playing games on easy?",
    "Why you stressing yourself out?",
    "Man, just relax.",
    "Eight months is good to game 'cause you got like at least a solid hour or two for nap.",
    "I think yes it's true, but see if I play that game on on on hard that whole hour I would have.",
    "I don't know when I was done I would've spent the entire hour trying to kill like one clicker.",
    "Of.",
    "But that is true.",
    "It is a good age is a good age for gaming.",
    "I agree it was better for gaming six months and then prior to that was when she was like 2 months.",
    "Have it printed or something like that, but.",
    "It's just I haven't done it for being honest.",
    "Let's cover shape tool.",
    "I'll try to just draw the goo blah, but it didn't look good.",
    "Right?",
    "So it was curious is how I'm grabbing the color.",
    "If you just tap on the screen and hold, it will bring up the eyedropper tool you can grab.",
    "Select what you want.",
    "And then you can use it.",
    "Choo Choo Choo.",
    "Alright, we got some groceries falling off the off the Donut man.",
    "We got some hairs which are disgusting.",
    "We gotta add those sprinkles.",
    "So to do the sprinkles, let's see here.",
    "What do I want to do I want to make this happen with number line work like our line color.",
    "Bump this up.",
    "Let's turn off pressure, velocity, dynamics.",
    "Let's turn this up really high 24.",
    "So something that I want to point out.",
    "By the way, if you want to check what your line looks like, this white box up here where I'm drawing, you can draw your line up here and see what it looks like before you make it.",
    "You can adjust certain things, you can just like your angles and stuff like that and kind of get something that kind of works.",
    "So my plan here.",
    "I'm playing here to do the sprinkles is too.",
    "Draw them on a separate layer like I'm doing.",
    "But the man and I don't know how long till I don't want to leave him the way they are.",
    "Maybe like chocolate sprinkles, you know, and they could be like the color of the line work.",
    "Um?",
    "Way too fat.",
    "So let's turn him down a little bit.",
    "No.",
    "Or we could totally try something like I got idea we're going to try it, but I don't know if it'll work.",

    "So we could draw some stuff behind him.",
    "And not have it.",
    "You know either way.",
    "So I filled in my character with white.",
    "So again I can start drawing some stuff behind and not have to worry about, you know, poking through or anything like that.",
    "Cool.",
    "Purple.",
    "Hey Hey Little Bluestem, is that a type of thing?",
    "I don't know what that first word is you wrote.",
    "That's like, Have you ever seen like like in German?",
    "Sometimes they have like compound words without basically put a whole ton of stuff together and it makes like a crazy word never seen before.",
    "It even fathom what it says.",
    "That's what it looks like.",
    "You wrote it feel like I'm reading.",

    "Whoa too much.",
    "Cool.",
    "I can move the paper around OK.",
    "Do you often draw upside down?",
    "That's we don't pull on the shock, yeah, I rotate my campus all time so whenever I used to draw I was like a paper flipper you know and I do it sometimes just because it's easier for my hand like I like to draw like going to make a U shaped like to go like that way versus going like.",
    "Leave you know, this way like I have a hard time going from my down over to the upper right and then coming back down around.",
    "I don't know why that is my preferred to go the opposite so I'll go from top right to bottom left.",
    "It just feels more comfortable for me when drawing.",
    "I hope that makes a lot of sense.",
    "what I just said.",
    "But that's why I'm always rotating the canvas.",
    "It just feels more natural for me.",
    "Alright, so let's add in some like just if you guys remember, let's go back to what we're kind of sort of illustrating.",

    "And you do that PlayStation, but seeing some pretty bad reviews about.",
    "Really see I've only seen good reviews.",
    "It's OK, I can't trust reviews anymore.",
    "I've really hard time the reviews and here's one of my issues with the reviews.",
    "I feel like people only review things when they don't like it, so it creates like a vacuum of like you know.",
    "Like think about it like when you go and have a bad meal at a restaurant you're like.",
    "I'm gonna go on Yelp and rip this restaurant part.",
    "But when you have a good meal house and you're like this meal was fantastic, I need to talk about how good it was.",
    "Almost never.",
    "Almost tempted not to tarnish the franchise in your mind.",
    "OK, fair enough.",

    "Glass of us I'd spend like 10 + 10 plus tries per encounter, but now I'm getting through like one threat.",
    "Yeah, I will say my buddies and I talked about this.",
    "The puzzles in this one or a lot easier to solve than the last one.",
    "I can watch any part of a sleeping.",

    "Our daughter sleeps like it blew our minds.",
    "There was a night.",
    "Well, two months is Ella exaggeration.",

    "But we we like woke up in the morning and were like Oh my God she didn't eat.",
    "Last night we missed the feeling like horrible.",
    "We went in there like things like freaking out no dead asleep like my daughter sleeps so well I'm spoiled by it.",
    "As much people acting like I was talking about, kids don't have one.",
    "Like what happened the other night yesterday she went to bed at Seven 7:30 and slept till 8:30 the next morning.",
    "My daughter sleeps in.",
    "That's great.",
    "Oh sure, you will be no.",
    "Oh no, that's why I'm not having another one.",
    "Alright, let's see here.",
    "Just make it.",
    "Let's make a big dot there.",
    "Race will probably be done with doing this part.",
    "Sorry that was very tedious.",

    "Went out public is crazy.",
    "I like I realize that like I mean I don't get out much to begin with.",
    "'cause I work from home and.",
    "Anyway, so.",
    "Uh.",
    "I don't really go outside a whole lot.",
    "I mean, I like to go outside like I go outdoors in like hiking stuff, but like I don't.",
    "Like I don't go to the bar that often, you know?",
    "And now the whole pandemic thing and everything being closed.",

    "Today I finally was like I need to go outside and I'm going to go mountain biking, but that didn't happen.",
    "'cause there ain't so.",
    "And there was like Thunder and lightning and something about riding a giant piece of \u00a340 metal doesn't sound appealing enough under storm, so I so files like I need to get out.",
    "So I went to the liquor store and I bought some beers.",
    "I bought a South answers later.",
    "I remember the companies just looks really good.",
    "Nothing to drink one later I beat the Last of Us.",
    "That's my plan.",
    "And then watch cartoons.",
    "Watch them.",
    "It's merge them together.",
    "Not merging, but let's put into a group.",
    "The reason why I'm going to do that, because then take this group so I don't want to have to keep duplicating over and over and over again is annoying.",
    "Put these on a group.",
    "Let's take this group was duplicate the group and then let's just move the group and we can rotate it.",
    "Now they're not going to fall like perfectly into like a cool area, but we can kind of get it close.",
    "Just something that kind of works.",
    "Given kind of squeeze it and can stretch this out.",
    "Cool, now I take this and we can work this way to we can ungroup all those layers.",
    "And we start grabbing these individually.",
    "Now we kind of move him around where we want him.",
    "Just a little bit of an easier way to do this, you know.",
    "Down there.",
    "I also just learned that if you have the transform tool active and then you grab a new layer, but you just tap on it, you can move something.",
    "I did not know you could do that in Frisco.",
    "That would save me a lot of time in other illustrations.",
    "Then group all those and let's just duplicate a few of these guys are going to move around.",
    "That one up here get outta sprinkle on your head, you know?",
    "It won't work with my display tablet and you don't have an iPad.",

    "It's not going to work.",
    "Unfortunately.",
    "I think the argument today is because that's if you're on like a desktop or something like that.",
    "That's why you would have this wrinkle is this one.",
    "You would have something like illustrator or Photoshop at your disposal.",
    "This basically is a way to avoid using those apps here.",
    "I think this was working.",
    "That might be the no fly zone.",
    "Oops.",
    "Sneak this one behind the phone.",
    "There we go.",
    "Cool, we got sprinkled Donut.",
    "Alright, what else is donut?",

    "Fact that had.",
    "Alright, so let's add in some of that dark, so we're currently in the background and we're going to make sure we have our purple selected so you can select your colors from the color palette here.",
    "But you can also tap and hold on the screen.",
    "It brings up an eyedropper and you can select color that way.",
    "It's really easy, quick way to do it.",
    "Let's move that out-of-the-way.",
    "And let's start adding in our dark kind of.",
    "Blobby colors in the background and then she started over here.",
    "Oops cancel, let's make sure we have a brush.",
    "He's always really fun to do.",
    "It's honestly.",
    "It's just big like loopy kind of textures.",
    "It's actually just.",
    "Can I connect to the body?",
    "And over here.",

    "Let's make this look.",
    "You know, pretty somebody wants to animate it later or something, or I want to animate it.",
    "You know it's easy to do another streamer.",
    "Ryan Selby, was trying to hit a character mind recently and I remember we opened up my project I think Oh my God is gonna sell my secrets and there's like so many bad misplaced lines in the background.",
    "It's horrible.",
    "Alright, let's let's now add in some just some details you know.",
    "So just going to kind of add in some smaller sort of little bubbly shapes in between all this stuff.",

    "Like where the characters actual cups and stuff that is a bummer for that do also.",
    "I don't want the research 'cause I'm sure he didn't know and I've done that before by accident.",
    "Like anyone out there that's a designer ever design something and then be like, oh, this is very similar to blank.",
    "That actually so that happened with me on a project last year.",

    "Anyway.",
    "The logo was supposed to feel like a bourbon kinda vibe like he's grilling is outside very manly so we do this like this answer blocky kind of condensed typeface for the logo treatment and it had like an O with O's question.",
    "I had a little like bar underneath it.",
    "'cause it was supposed to like feel like I don't know like a number thing or whatever.",
    "I don't know.",
    "It just felt like it fit the brand, not the boy.",
    "They change the name to Stoke 'cause he stoking the fire.",

    "That's super weird.",
    "I might have to do like a collection of that.",
    "Now I'm thinking about it like I could totally step in after effects and use rubber hose to animate this character and I could make my own.",
    "Oh my gosh, I'm going to have to do this.",
    "I can make my own interstitials for.",
    "Oh yes, I'm going to do that some point in my life.",
    "A lot of things like that I need to make creatively.",

    "So yeah.",
    "Cool alright soda man looking good alright, let's add some shading.",
    "So what are we going to lower the opacity down to 28?",
    "Now, even lower than that was saying 9 Don.",
    "Where to go around the backside here of the frosting and we're just going to.",
    "How do you trace along the line now, the reason why?",
    "You're not seeing it like overlap is because I'm using the actual color of the line work.",
    "So if I were to raise this up, see what I'm saying when you lower down there looks really nice.",
    "It's a good way to to create shadows quickly.",
    "This could probably be darker.",
    "Let's cancel.",
    "Maybe if I like the shadow on the arm, so I'm going to.",
    "Move that just kind of.",
    "There we go.",

    "It was a little bit on the pig nose.",
    "And start adding it on this side of the little frosting groups.",
    "Now, so these things are kind of dripping there going to be a little bit off the body, so we want to put the shadow more of like a drop shadow so.",
    "I don't want to add a photo right now.",
    "That's a new feature, by the way.",
    "I did not know they put in here, so that's cool.",

    "Just kind of adding some highlights.",
    "Think of the highlights on this one.",
    "I'm going to turn off pressure and velocity dynamics where White is a collection of white.",
    "Light is a collection of all the colors.",

    "Little lesson on lighting for y'all.",

    "Here we're going to do something similar.",
    "I don't know why did this, I just thought it looked cool.",
    "Here we can see the original.",
    "This was the first piece that I drew.",
    "That inspired this piece, so you can kind of see it over like the quarters of the smoke.",
    "There's some like hash Marks and stuff like that, so we're going to add those in on the piece that I'm drawing right now.",

    "Want to get the ones at the time 'cause I want to read those on their own layer.",
    "I don't know, maybe not, maybe I like it.",
    "New layer cut down on the tongue.",
    "Let's turn on our pressure and velocity and turn this up.",
    "Please.",

    "Current issue out then wash hands later.",
    "Hello.",
    "Stuff on the sprinkles here.",

    "Now let's just do like.",
    "A point of shimmer.",
    "There we go.",
    "What does that mean?",
    "Shading will fix that.",
    "But maybe there is a little bit on the backside.",
    "I almost played around this idea where I would put in.",
    "He's like really big kind of dots.",
    "It was on a previous illustration and then I would.",
    "Bye.",
    "Right, I work on this one.",
    "Just to create some like atmosphere, I don't know.",

    "Actually fun fact the since we're talking about I gotta spawn one.",
    "Right here.",
    "This little Guy Macfarlane.",

    "No spawn action figure.",
    "I've got several more.",
    "Behind me right over there.",
    "Hum.",
    "So you gotta see over the shoulder.",
    "I've got a nice Star Wars McFarland Chewbacca.",
    "Right here.",
    "So I like my McFarlane action figures.",
    "I can't use fresco on PC, how come Joe?",
    "Because flaps, you need an iPad or surface for it.",
    "So I'm I'm sorry.",
    "Of course, I'm not the position to.",
    "Get it to.",
    "You can't be like alright, let me call somebody.",

    "You want everyone to use the app you love so much.",
    "I don't know.",
    "I'm loving the reflection dots.",
    "I do like that blob though, that I just threw in the background for no reason.",
    "Let's keep that going.",
    "Keep the blob.",
    "Maybe we'll do like some.",
    "Maybe takes smoke.",
    "Do you have hundreds of figures?",
    "That's awesome.",
    "Which ones you collect the most stuff?",
    "Like what sounds like to go to.",
    "Like you've gone to Newbury Comics.",
    "Also, if you know what Newbury Comics is, awesome if you don't know what Newbury Comics is, check it out.",
    "So.",
    "All right, there we go.",
    "Cool.",
    "Hairy mess, they look great.",
    "Too much detail and maybe distracting.",
    "It's very true.",
    "Yeah, I kind of like just like I'm floating either.",
    "So we're going to there like on in the background.",
    "Going to add some actually into our groups missed so we are smoking Misty layer.",
    "We're just going to.",
    "Actually you guys gotta be smaller in the background so really little smaller.",
    "There we go.",
    "Is that a few and they'll be some miss Dotson pollen in the mist I guess.",
    "Pollen in the myth that allow it sounds like it be like a Pink Floyd song.",
    "Oh, the lyrics would be to that jam.",
    "There we go.",
    "We're actually now.",
    "It sounds more like a be a song by rainbow.",
    "Anyone here ever listen to rainbow?",
    "It's a great band.",
    "Learn.",
    "So wheat OK, so we got our pollen or buggies.",
    "Let's have some shading and we're probably gonna wrap this drawing upon.",
    "Probably be the end of it.",
    "So nice, not too much else to do here.",
    "Let's see to add are shading or to create a.",
    "We're actually let's breakdown this texture that we kind of created lever as we're calling it.",
    "Let's grab our line, the color of our line work.",
    "Create a new layer of, spoke about 17, and all we're going to do is we're literally going to add in some shade.",
    "Now I know what you're thinking.",
    "Online sticker, that's because when I turned down our opacity there we go.",
    "Now we can draw over top for a line work and kind of hide it behind stuff and make it look really good.",
    "Really quick easy way to add some shading.",
    "And that might be a little intense.",
    "Will turn it down just a little bit more.",
    "Shoegaze band name pollen in the best OK.",
    "I like this idea.",
    "What band wrote the song pollen in the miss we got shoe gaze is the band name.",
    "I don't think it hurts.",
    "You gave that a real band or you're making that up.",
    "Is this real bad?",
    "I'm going right to Spotify when the stream is over to listen to them, or do they have a song already named pollen in the mess?",
    "'cause if they do, that's that And also I would really bummed that I created something cool and turns out it already missed in the world.",
    "So coming off the body are going to come down.",
    "Let's make a nice thick line.",
    "Then I go on something out.",
    "I want to come off of this the jaw here so bring it down there and let's add in some big shade here on the tongue.",
    "So I'm just going to make some like Blobby shapes to kind of do this and fill them in.",
    "Skype self.",
    "Come here.",
    "Shoe gaze is the style.",
    "Oh.",
    "OK, so there's are.",
    "So what I'm doing here is it just basically getting a big blob and then I'm adding in, you know with the paint bucket just filling it in really quick.",
    "I don't claim to be like this.",
    "Great sheeting expert 'cause I think I'm terrible.",
    "But that's kind of how I make my shade.",
    "They're pretty much just tracing, retracing the lines you know in a little bit and then adding in some kind of like blah BS shapes like that and Fillingham.",
    "Just to give the idea of like that, there's you know.",
    "Some sort of I don't know.",
    "Shaped like the body like is our faces and stuff like that extrude and all kinds of things you know.",
    "Librarian Creepy Newscaster.",

    "Makes me feel uncomfortable.",
    "The donor God makes you feel uncomfortable.",
    "This is the Giant Donut.",
    "What part of the donut man makes you uncomfortable is the fact that it's a sentient going out with the tongue coming out of the whole.",
    "'cause that's the part that makes me uncomfortable.",
    "Francis Bert.",
    "Hector I like I like all three Francis Bert, Hector.",

    "Box wine this do we drink box wine for sure.",
    "So it's kind of supposed to be floating in the air, but he looks like he's just like honest to, so I'm going to add some going to add a little shading behind his feet in about a second after I lower the opacity down just a little bit, just to kind of.",
    "And how does it make you feel?",
    "The audio jumps back sometimes.",
