    "It's kind of a typical process, so I'm probably going to start with some rust and and see how far we get on them today.",
    "And often when I start a new one, I really don't have much.",

    "Laughing.",
    "Well, I want something to sort of like stretch your face with a big open like big belly laugh type of thing.",

    "Make like a nice expression sheet.",
    "One of the number one tips I always tell people who are interested in character design and they show me maybe a sort of student portfolio is.",
    "Something that a lot of young artists do an I used to do this as well so I'm not faulting you guys is like just copy and paste just ahead in the shoulders and redraw the expression an not reach all the body.",
    "I would highly recommend if you want like a nice professional looking character design.",
    "Portfolio is do what I'm doing right now instead and make entirely new like fun of closes instead of just like changing your default model with different faces.",

    "What do you mean?",
    "Watching at least the stuff I've worked on?",
    "Case we we draw Lee.",
    "",
    " Like I'm I'm drawing anywhere from like 5 to 20 new poses per episode or something usually.",
    "However, if it's like a.",
    "I guess with CG and of course like there's sometimes you repeat certain sequences alot, like if characters have some sort of.",
    "I guess like thing that they do.",
    "Every episode I'm trying to find a good word to describe it, but it kind of like if you're watching something that's the equivalent of like Sailor Moon or Voltron.",
    "And like whenever the character changes costumes, or like the robot connects together, it's sort of the same sequence.",
    "And this stuff like that young children's like CGI shows as well, I know.",
    "I guess it depends on the show, the audience, what it's for.",
    "Sorry.",
    "Hey, this is cute but I'm feeling like maybe should her ponytail be facing the other way here.",
    "Probably.",
    "Yeah.",

    "Yeah the hair is going to be the hardest part for me personally.",
    "To get used to drawing on her, I think it has a very unique shape.",
    "This sort of smoosh right here.",
    "That's OK, we'll figure it out.",
    "As you can see her hand there, I'm not being lazy by only drawing one hand, I promise.",
    "OK, I like this drawing.",
    "I think it's Cute.",
    "Little kids show, Oh God, you David?",
    "Yeah, I guess that's true.",
    "I know there's a lot of sort of like marketing type poses like promotional images that young shows use a lot if they want the characters to be instantly recognizable like a kids like, Oh, I've definitely seen that before.",
    "You know what I mean?",
    "Because when you're when you're so so young.",
    "That it's hard to distinguish between like different, you know, like the characters are all different colors and shapes, just so that somebody who doesn't have.",
    "Their brain isn't really developed to the point where they can recognize subtle differences between different drawings.",
    "Can tell who the characters are like.",
    "Tell them apart so.",
    "Yeah, makes sense that they use very iconic poses of that like Oh, I remember it's that one.",
    "The reason this is speaking this is my personal opinion, disclaimer, opinions do not represent my employers.",
    "They are my own.",
    "The personal opinion, the amount of research that goes in select.",
    "The development of children's like cartoons like really young children that toddlers cartoons in media properties is.",

    "She was hyperactive, tables in those Oh yeah, not as nice.",
    "That doesn't sound.",
    "I completely understand what you mean.",
    "Yeah, some of those people thing sounds on the surface like it would be a blessing, but definitely not necessarily.",
    "Solid solid.",
    "You certainly pose.",
    "I'm probably going to let reference off screen as well.",
    "It's always always great to reference chart.",
    "Never feel like it's cheating or that's not what the pros do.",
    "Everybody references for photos of poses.",
    "Don't let anybody tell you that they don't.",
    "In fact, I think that like most people who were like much better artist than me or hammer hammered and so so much more.",
    "They're like reference more reference more.",
    "And a great way to reference fun like character acting poses.",
    "I will show you guys really, really quickly, but I'm not going to leave it on the screen for Copyright reasons.",
    "You know, since I'm streaming, but a great way to find cool references to look at movie Screencaps.",
    "So since this is sort of like an adventure Explorer type character, I'm looking at some.",
    "So like Indiana Jones like film screen house.",
    "If you just sort of search movie screencaps, you can find some really great websites that, like they literally, as you can see, take.",
    "Small photos of the entire film within sequence in order, and you can sort of scrub through it and find some really good art reference.",
    "Highly recommend doing that.",
    "He chose have so many episodes.",
    "Who can't blame them for recycling in yard?",
    "They possibly can, yeah.",
    "Yeah exactly.",
    "I mean like we're using art is just being economical.",

    "I guess this isn't a bad thing.",
    "What sort of behaviors are in a table so that they need to make extra sure not to have kids like characters do on screen?",
    "Because then your children might try and do it, and then they might get themselves hurt.",
    "You know something like that.",
    "Don't tell anyone, but every using patterns a lot for different questions.",
    "Modify them.",
    "Yeah, exactly exactly, I mean.",

    "Sort of a not angry, but like a.",
    "Determined.",
    "I like you already.",
    "Just need your good sense of like the like direction in 3D space.",
    "Even though it's a 2D drawing.",
    "I do that kind of research to try to predict and fall trends.",
    "Yeah, exactly like right now.",
    "I know because super mini pleasure.",
    "Wait, like right now I know super mini pleasure.",

    "Sort of.",
    "I only feel like sometimes when it's.",
    "Targeted at really, really young children.",
    "Maybe it's a little bit problematic, but I know that or on.",
    "For adults I have 0 problems with that.",
    "Kind of people spend like.",
    "You know, I don't know forever 21 or something or Zara has probably spent approximately $10,000,000 to best market, like a pair of shoes to me, to me in particular.",

    "He found her wrist hand area too long now this little weird.",
    "Smaller tube in her room.",
    "Some called the Loomis method after the opera popular drawing book.",
    "Oh, I've heard that before.",
    "I always just heard people calling it across her.",
    "But I've seen people that don't actively shake their faces that way.",
    "They just make it to the circle or Oval is the face.",
    "It's kind of confusing.",
    "I mean, I don't think there's a I don't like heating and saying there's a right or wrong way to draw anything, but that's just the method that works good for me.",
    "Some people have their own workflow or a lot of times.",
    "Some people, even if they don't draw it there thinking it internally.",
    "It's kind of the equivalent of.",
    "When?",
    "When your kid, when you're like, you know in.",
    "Elementary school middle school.",
    "Something like that.",
    "Your teacher tells you to show every step in the process of an equation or something.",
    "You know what I mean?",
    "Like if they're saying.",
    "They tell you to solve like.",
    "X +6 equals 11.",
    "You know you like Oh well, it's five.",
    "I know it's 5, but they're like no, no, you have to show your work.",
    "Say like fine so you have to do this.",
    "Answer that out, X equals 5.",
    "You know what I mean, so some people are just skipping to the answer and doing the work in their head.",
    "Bet you didn't expect map in this art stream.",
    "All my my viewer number just crashes immediately.",
    "People are like, oh, math.",
    "What is this?",
    "And some clambers over every few, Jay Masson Paw Patrol have actually kind of obnoxious all, yeah.",
    "Pizza is all about finding the method that fits with you absolutely, Diana.",
    "I agree with you Maps and drawings cool.",
    "Hey Martin, how are you doing?",
    "Welcome, I promise there will be no more Maps for the rest of the screen.",
    "The stream excuse me, but I couldn't think of a better way to describe that.",
    "Then when your teacher forces you to show the work versus not having to show the work anymore.",
    "When you get a little bit older when you're like in high school or college or whatever.",
    "She said that ask about it.",
    "I know to do together arm now that's always what I struggle with these drawings on like I haven't holding something in one hand and arm in the pose is great.",
    "And then like what do I do with that other arms just wasting space?",
    "Oh, she should be standing on Oh my God, hold on I was just going to make it like a rock or something.",
    "Let's get really edgy with us right now.",
    "Hi love.",
    "Right?",

    "When I was in college I was in art school I had a part time job tutoring an on one of the classes that I I actually.",
    "It was like 95% of probably of my tutoring was helping people pass the basic like.",
    "It was art school, so math wasn't important, but you had to pass to see sort of basic, almost like remedial entry level amounts of algebra just to count as enough to like graduate or something.",
    "Most people here in their freshman year, an unfortunately like the stereotype of artists, are bad at math, prevailed.",
    "I don't think that stereotype is true, but I think that it gets in peoples heads and it causes them to really lack self confidence because.",
    "I was decent enough at it that I was able to tutor people on this subject as like a part time job at the school and every person that I tutored when they started, they were just like I can't do this.",
    "I just look at it.",
    "I can't do it.",
    "I can't do it and I'm like, yes, you can, just you can.",
    "You can do it.",
    "And then by the end they all passed and they were all like totally capable.",
    "And they're like, oh like, once you just explain this, injure it out on a piece of paper and it says to me, and it is really sad how much like.",
    "I don't know the previous education had failed on.",
    "My guess is honestly the way to put it.",
    "I wouldn't consider myself very good teacher, but uhm.",
    "I think that's the reason why I remember is his I.",
    "I was doing a lot of that when I was a little bit older and then also I think that was probably around the age when my youngest sibling was still.",
    "I'm the oldest in the younger siblings.",
    "Or a lot younger than me.",
    "I still lived at home.",
    "I still gave them some math homework help every once in awhile.",
    "I can't do anything beyond like algebra and like.",
    "Basic geometry now, though I've forgotten the rest and I never took trig in high school I slapped my senior year.",
    "I didn't take that.",
    "As a huge slacker.",
    "Hey.",
    "You just have it for arm across town or leg like this.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Powers.",
    "Neither dear, how are you welcome back to mass noticed size mouse?",
    "Yes, that's fair.",
    "That's valid, yeah.",
    "Is it an I I can identify with that I'm not bad at it, but I'm not saying that I enjoy it either.",
    "That's the calculators are foreign computers.",
    "Why?",
    "Why did humans build computers if not to no longer do math?",
    "I change this song.",
    "I don't love it.",
    "The deer you get it.",
    "Welcome to the stream and let me know if I'm pronouncing your screen name wrong.",
    "How you doing today?",
    "We're doing some fun like rough character poses based off of his character design that we worked on a couple weeks ago on stream.",
    "Her name is Sierra.",
    "She is a teenage cryptozoologist We did this really fun turn around of her and we also shoot.",
    "Let me see if I can find the file, open it up and show you guys.",
    "Did a really cool painting as well.",
    "That's actually where this entire idea came from.",
    "I just did this painting and I thought it looks cool.",
    "And then we started sort of forming like a story around it, which is a lot of fun.",
    "Uh, where?",
    "Here it is.",
    "How long for the shop?",
    "Yeah, this is the painting.",
    "I finally finished this.",

    "He had and how are you nice to see you?",
    "No, I usually don't use those words.",
    "Dummies Mart and I like to look at photo reference of people.",
    "And sometimes if I can't find the exact hose you know for the reference, I just try and make it up or use my practice life drawing anatomy knowledge to figure it out.",
    "It looks wonderful.",
    "Thank you in the deer.",
    "Hi, I'm well glad to hear that.",
    "I found out I could take computer science is a math credit and there is no math involved when when that's Fantastic Moon Kitty and I honestly I feel like he might get more out of that.",
    "I just get bored, lose focus and look like about student.",
    "I mean, that's the thing like I I, there's nothing wrong with this.",
    "I think institutional learning is very important and should be better funded and stuff like that.",
    "But the problem is is like 1 size learning doesn't always work for everybody.",
    "Lots of people learn in different ways and that's OK.",
    "Some people are more like audio.",
    "Some people are more visual.",
    "Some people need more hands on where some people just want to like use the book.",

    "Hum.",
    "Through online workshops, classes, social media through some local workshop, nontraditional type of learning like out of outside of traditional college setting, and I think that that is how I sort of rebuilt and reinvented my work and learned a lot more that way.",
    "So the answer is both.",
    "I didn't personally have the best art school experience, except that I met a lot of great people there, including the man who have become my husband now.",
    "Meeting my sweet, wonderful husband Jay was the best part in one of the only good things about art.",
    "In my honest opinion, for me personally.",
    "I think a lot of other people I know and work with had much better art school experiences, but they also went to better schools.",
    "So when people ask me should I go to art school?",
    "My personal opinion is if you get a scholarship you should go or if your parents can afford it, you should go.",

    "There are.",
    "Some so here we have private institutions which most art schools are.",
    "And, uh, it private school is there always very expensive 'cause there's something like um?",

    "And in my state particularly.",
    "Some of the state run institutions are starting to have competitive are programs that are actually really good, and I think that's awesome and I hope that is something that continues to develop and flourish.",
    "'cause If I were someone who is going back to school as an artist right now, I would highly recommend going to a state school over a private institution.",
    "Like you're gonna get a really good education going to like Cal State Fullerton or something like that instead of like Art Center.",
    "Or rather, I should say a comperable education, but you're going to be significantly in less than.",
    "As a career where you don't, the degree helps, but you don't necessarily need it.",
    "Like if your work is good, people are going to hire you don't need this certificate.",
    "Specifically in Animation an like Kmart Concept, Art stuff like that, I can't speak two graphics vines stuff 'cause it's not.",
    "OK, but And specifically in the career field that I work in, you absolutely do not need a degree with a four year Hashers degree.",
