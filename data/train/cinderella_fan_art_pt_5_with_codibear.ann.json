    "Um, because again I feel like it's just.",
    "It's a little bit more me and it makes.",
    "My stuff a little bit more unique because nobody can copy my handwriting.",
    "And it also just kind of gives us a little bit more of a rustic appeal.",
    "My stuff.",
    "So I've kind of stopped using fonts and just started handwriting everything.",
    "All right, well, I guess we didn't really have.",

    "Thank you so much for hanging out with me today.",
