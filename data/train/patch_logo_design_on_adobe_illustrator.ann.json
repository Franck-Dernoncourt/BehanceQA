    "I feel tired down and I can't just reach over and grab stuff.",
    "And so I said, OK, well, let me go ahead and use.",
    "It is boom they got the lower 3rd and let me go ahead and use a different microphone I have.",
    "I have a gun in his hard to see, but there it is.",
    "If you're on Facebook you can see this.",
    "It's all let me see which which is when it's working aware.",

    "But on Facebook.",
    "I have this other microphone over here.",
    "So now let's go ahead switch size again boom and see look.",
    "Bowman I gotta couple computers over here on the right side.",

    "Be hands.",
    "And then I got another camera up there and I'm pointing at you Facebook let's let's do it went out, you know?",
    "That way I can share some progress on my creative process when it comes to Adobe illustrator, Adobe fresco and I think it's kind of cool.",
    "It is, uhm.",
    "Sometimes one of the strings are cut off.",
    "I'm sorry about that, but make sure you follow me DTM I am on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter.",

    "So let me go on my glasses on and then I can see what it's saying.",
    "Let's do a zoom and then we can do that anytime you're ready, Johnny, and that's open to anyone who wants to talk to me.",
    "It's got something to share.",
    "I am hoping to talking to you.",
    "About either design illustration and the business of art, that is something that is very.",
    "I'm very passionate about.",
    "So if if you're interested in talking to me about something in particular, please reach out, say something and we'll get to it, OK?",

    "I like ice cream.",
    "I like drawing really.",
    "I like drawing.",
    "I'll draw and draw and draw and ally drawing so much.",
    "I find clients to pay me for that drawings for those drawings.",
    "OK, says I cut out Oh no.",
    "Yep.",
    "Oh here we go.",
    "Yeah, so this the stream on Facebook cut out.",
    "So I'm typing.",
    "My Facebook people.",
    "To come through on be hands because.",
    "It's uh.",
    "The stream just stopped.",
    "Sorry and I keep trying to fix it and it's not going to work.",
    "So alright, let's keep it rolling 'cause we're here on Behance Now.",
    "Alright, so now it's just be hands.",
    "Daddy How do you do shading and illustrator?",
    "Hey Elizabeth, thank you for leaving a comment and a question an under Behance page.",
    "I'm gonna jump right in on that in a second.",
    "Just going to go ahead and stop this so there it is.",
    "Yep.",
    "Stuck frozen.",
    "Stop it.",
    "And still stuck.",
    "Sorry I'm doing a little bit of A.",
    "Housekeeping on that Computer.",
    "Alright, so cool, let's get to it right and I'm glad I got this microphone 'cause now I got really good microphone.",
    "We take this off for a second 'cause my ears are hat alright.",
    "There it is.",
    "Boom I cut out, it would end it all right.",
    "So I'm going to work on a piece.",
    "It was cool.",
    "Let's go ahead and show my desktop.",
    "I'm going to work on a piece in illustrator.",
    "And in the IT has to do with a Patch design of a logo that I already created an Elizabeth I'm going to answer your question.",
    "I'm going to get to that and tell you about how I shade and so before we get started, let's go ahead and jump into that question.",
    "Here we go.",
    "Boom Dallas Crazy I'm sorry for everything you guys have gone through here on the hands.",
    "Alright, Here it is alright so.",
    "The way I do my shading in illustrator, it's all about your layers, right?",
    "And there's several ways to go about it.",
    "So let's go ahead and jump in an open illustrator.",
    "Now I've got a special version of illustrator and in that it allows me to see my cloud documents and when it.",
    "When it's finally released, you'll be able to see some of your cloud documents also, right now on your home page, you'll be able to see some of your.",
    "What do you call it?",
    "Recent's recent projects.",
    "As my coffee, but then they'll be this cloud documents tab and you can see some of the illustrations that you worked on an Adobe illustrator for iPad, so that's really cool.",
    "I really like that.",
    "Alright, let's go back to home.",
    "Here's a good one to work on.",
    "Let's go ahead and work on this number 3.",
    "This is number 3.",
    "Let's work on some shading.",
    "Well, just to show you a little bit about shading.",
    "In illustrator we have the advantage as an advantage.",
    "Of course, using layers, so like right here, our life all day you see how it has this shading right.",
    "Here is really nice shading.",
    "I mean it's kinda.",
    "It looks like shading.",
    "But it's really a layer that has some shapes, so let me lock all these layers up.",
    "No, not that one.",
    "No, no yeah that one it is.",
    "And so inside of this layer we have these shapes right here.",
    "And if you turn it off is gone.",
    "Turned it on.",
    "There it is.",
    "I've already thought of a better way of doing doing this shading so it's going to be gone.",
    "It's all going to be gone.",
    "Take it out there it is and so my technique is very simple.",
    "And and if this answers your question, please let me know and if there are still other parts that you were looking forward to me to talk about and you didn't hear him, please let me know.",
    "So get my pin tool.",
    "I love the pen tool.",
    "I'm going to copy the same angle be similar.",
    "Sort of similar.",
    "Uh.",
    "It's a matter of fact.",
    "What am I doing here?",
    "Yes, I'm going to make a copy of that every day.",
    "So what I'm gonna do?",
    "And let's go ahead and put a color on it.",
    "Yeah, it's gotta color.",
    "There.",
    "For now I'm trying to.",
    "I'm going to copy my my angle, that's all I'm doing is copying my angle.",
    "Here it is.",
    "This angle represents.",
    "Um?",
    "This part.",
    "This angle represents the angle that I'm going to use in doing all this shading.",
    "Alright, so I have a shape this is shape, right?",
    "It's just a shape, there's nothing to it.",
    "OK, so here we go shift and our know.",
    "Also I can make a copy.",
    "And then boom is going to go right there.",
    "That's it.",
    "So all of my layers are going to be similar to that.",
    "So let me click this.",
    "Click that and then move this over some.",
    "Is getting close, and now let's stick it right.",
    "There we go.",
    "Boom, that's it.",
    "So they said This Is This is the the template I'm going to use for all of my.",
    "Shading.",
    "Uh-huh Phone like I like it now that I have that I'm going to click and drag across these and go down like that.",
    "Yes, that's it.",
    "I just established my.",
    "Shading.",
    "And I actually didn't have to put that on there.",
    "But I do need to make one.",
    "Anyone there?",
    "It is boom that's it.",
    "Now I moved that down.",
    "Every dance.",
    "Got it, the only part that matters is this top part right here.",
    "'cause after that this part here.",
    "You can go here.",
    "I cannot leave my pen tool hanging out.",
    "Come on pin tool.",
    "All right?",
    "Boom, so now you can see like there's some kind of shadow or 3D effect that is going to start showing up here.",
    "And Oh yes, why do I have that here?",
    "I need that.",
    "There it is.",
    "Got it cool.",
    "Awesome.",
    "There it is and so here it comes.",
    "So now I'm slowly going to build out.",
    "This.",
    "Some of this are.",
    "This these layers shapes to give this a shading effect.",
    "And you can do this, you know, not that way I'm doing it.",
    "There's all kinds of ways of going about what I'm doing right now.",
    "I'm just kind of being Super.",
    "Careful about all the angle there, so so as I move on across the letters and a half this.",
    "The shape right here and look, I can click on that hit my Pathfinder boom there saw one shape.",
    "And so now it looks like there's a shadow very simple in this.",
    "By you loading up, I don't want it like that loading up.",
    "A layer was shapes and then you turn down the opacity of the layer or this is multiply.",
    "Here's normal.",
    "Here it is.",
    "If I turn it down like that, what if I do multiply an turn it down, then look?",
    "Now I got a whole another shade and that's one of the ways in which we do shading.",
    "Here's another way as I am.",
    "I'm working on the skull.",
    "Here's my skull.",
    "There's there's a layer for the shadows, you see that.",
    "Later for the highlights and a layer for the color of the skull, and so by you layering.",
    "Layer shapes, layering shapes, then you give the effect of a shadow.",
    "Now there is the next step is really where you know well there's another a couple of these steps.",
    "One of the steps that can be get really, really crazy and fun.",
    "Is if?",
    "You add a gradient, so let's add a gradient to this all 'cause it's not going to have a gradient when I'm really done with it, but I'm going to do it now so you can see it.",
    "Then I'm going to get to the project that I came here for, right?",
    "So let me lock that up.",
    "No, no lock that up and get this one out there we go, boom or not, let's like this one up and get this one.",
    "Alright here we go, gradients, gradients are your friends.",
    "Get the fill color.",
    "And as we look at OK boom, there's a gradient on it right there.",
    "And in the shadow is coming from this side going out that way.",
    "Look at that off.",
    "On That said, 46% I can make it darker.",
    "I can make it lighter.",
    "I can do whatever I want.",
    "Let me see.",
    "Here we go.",
    "Turn that up a little bit turned me up.",
    "There we go, yes now.",
    "That's not all.",
    "Ha.",
    "That's not all there is to that.",
    "I can do more.",
    "So from there make another layer.",
    "Uh-huh I got my pencil here.",
    "Watch this.",
    "Boom, put a great in on it.",
    "And then this whole thing.",
    "This whole layer is going to have a multiply.",
    "And a boom.",
    "I said I don't.",
    "I don't think this is the right angles.",
    "Let me see.",
    "Well, that's pretty close.",
    "This side is bad.",
    "Uh-huh Is close all right?",
    "Here we go.",
    "Boom, see that.",
    "Alright, next.",
    "And as a matter fact is need to keep making copies.",
    "There we go.",
    "Van Uh-huh There it is.",
    "Elsa then needs to be under let's go back.",
    "There you go.",
    "Look at that.",
    "What do you think Elizabeth?",
    "What're y'all think about this?",
    "See that now is like.",
    "Whole whole new dimension.",
    "Of illustration is coming into play.",
    "Uh-huh There it is.",
    "And the reality of what needs to happen there.",
    "That's cool.",
    "Oh my gosh.",
    "Who?",
    "OK, that one is just needs to stay inside it here at the matter fast too.",
    "Let's go like this.",
    "Uh-huh Uh-huh There it is.",
    "Look at that.",
    "Ask Anna cool.",
    "I like it.",
    "I don't know what you guys think, but what do you think about that?",
    "Elizabeth and anybody else?",
    "Gotta comment, suggestion or question please drop it let me hear it.",
    "The key is that you use.",
    "Paths shapes.",
    "To give that illusion of shadow.",
    "And it's a combination of all these things that going to give you.",
    "An awesome design.",
    "Uh-huh That said, I need to figure out I'm gonna cut that out.",
    "All that's gotta get cut.",
    "OK, this is a copy of that one.",
    "So let's go there.",
    "Bam.",
    "Oh man.",
    "This is hardcore.",
    "I like it.",
    "I like it.",
    "I like this letter A part here.",
    "Let's go like this.",
    "Let's take it rid of that.",
    "And then this one needs to go up a little bit.",
    "Uh-huh And.",
    "Miss you saw that?",
    "Like that?",
    "Grab this.",
    "Uh-huh Hey girl, just add a little bit.",
    "Bring it in tighter.",
    "There it is.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Uh-huh Thank you you're welcome.",
    "You're welcome, Elizabeth.",
    "Thank you so much.",
    "You're welcome.",
    "There you go in.",
    "It's a It's a combination of the gradient tool.",
    "And the transparency.",
    "Or the gradient window radiant palette and the transparency palette and all of those things work together.",
    "what I like to do though is make sure that you set the transparency and blend modes to the actual layer.",
    "That way all of these things that you create inside that layer will carry that on.",
    "You don't want to have to keep adjusting each and every path that you create in a layer, because then after awhile now that's going to get redundant and tiring, and you'll be like what?",
    "Where did I even try to do this?",
    "Ah, see now that I added this gradient.",
    "Which is not what I intended to do.",
    "Now I gotta add it to the skull.",
    "Well, you know what I do have a gradient up there.",
    "And I have a great inside the skull.",
    "Ha ha ha.",
    "I may not do this one.",
    "This is too much of a gradient right there.",
    "This one the gradient has to be at the top, so I think that's 90 there.",
    "There it is.",
    "Or I can do it in the bottom.",
    "And as the negative 90 bam.",
    "Yeah, I could do that.",
    "I could do that.",
    "I don't know if I want to.",
    "'cause?",
    "'cause then that just adds extra time.",
    "I was not prepared to add extra time.",
    "To my design.",
    "But I just thought of some more things.",
    "As how it goes out, list to the gradient on this.",
    "Bang.",
    "And this negative nine?",
    "Oh yeah.",
    "And then I'm going to put the filter on this one.",
    "Multiply Errigo And actually, I'm gonna change that color.",
    "Yes.",
    "Boom boom boom.",
    "This girl here.",
    "And try.",
    "No.",
    "Color barn is cool.",
    "Our light Uh-huh I'm just playing with the ideas.",
    "Of course you.",
    "Saturation that doesn't help.",
    "Color.",
    "Turn down the Opacity.",
    "Doesn't help.",
    "Yes, go to multiply.",
    "And change that color.",
    "2.",
    "Lure Dark blue Uh-huh And if that's going to be dark.",
    "Then the worse.",
    "Are going to be white.",
    "There it is.",
    "Ah, and then it's going to look dramatic with the shading, uh?",
    "Mainly Elizabeth Ellis says I mainly traced.",
    "It outlines.",
    "I mainly Tracy outlines of a different parts of humans, but I wanted to make it more realistic so this definitely helps me out a lot.",
    "You welcome that's good.",
    "OK I'm glad it does help you out and into my other technique that I'm using with my 6 Fanarts And if you check my profile you see other videos and that post is on my be hands portfolio you'll notice and I must say this outside of.",
    "Outside of.",
    "Yeah, not in, not in.",
    "In the app.",
    "For school, for or have a school.",
    "Erin is skull service.",
    "And I have a whole another drawing shading style and let's pull that up.",
    "That I don't know if I have how many I have my show.",
    "It show you another style.",
    "Attorney directory up.",
    "There it is.",
    "Drink some coffee with that comes up boom.",
    "There it is.",
    "So this technique.",
    "Is a very very insane.",
    "There's a ton.",
    "Of shapes everywhere.",
    "Let me ow identify where they are.",
    "It's lock all these up.",
    "Whoops no.",
    "Undo Hama.",
    "There it is.",
    "So inside of here I have a group or of shadow shadow, so I think there's some shadows.",
    "Yep, that's The Shadow.",
    "There's another shadow.",
    "This is highlights.",
    "Highlights Highlights Highlights and another shadow.",
    "You see that is a ton of layers all working together to go from here to there.",
    "Anna's in since I'm showing you this, I'm gonna show you.",
    "The work on my homie.",
    "Maxi funk And this guy.",
    "This is his work.",
    "Look at this Oh my God, look how you get some shadows highlights.",
    "And all of that.",
    "Does he even have?",
    "YouTube channel I don't know, but look at that look at this.",
    "This is a star up here this this bright some some.",
    "Since shimmery light.",
    "That's not the right word.",
    "I understood that I this is Instagram.",
    "He isn't be hands.",
    "Uh, he has a website, let's see.",
    "Did he had an interview last year?",
    "Comic Con.",
    "But Yeah, he doesn't have.",
    "So here he is talking about what he does in his style and I think he actually did.",
    "A demo.",
    "OK, his work.",
    "Look at his work.",
    "Uh, where are his layers?",
    "Where are you?",
    "Layers menu won't show us.",
    "He has secrets.",
    "He has big time secrets is no layers.",
    "I don't see the layers.",
    "Here.",
    "But then he goes.",
    "He did show some his process and how he creates his work.",
    "There he is in a ambi hands.",
    "Look at all these different features.",
    "He's got been featured in SVA portfolios.",
    "I don't know what that means.",
    "Pantone Canvas Gallery Pratt portfolios.",
    "AIG a member Gallery packaging, character design and of course featured in be hands.",
    "Woo OK.",
    "Here we go.",
    "Bad boys for life this open that up.",
    "And years ago this Is.",
    "This Is This when I started following him 'cause when you open illustrator his art would come up.",
    "OK, so this is the old school illustrator.",
    "What year was this?",
    "And as fairly down the bottom, this is the vector right here.",
    "This is a.",
    "The preview, not the preview, but the line view.",
    "Look at this.",
    "Look at all those, look at.",
    "That is amazing.",
    "Bone.",
    "My God.",
    "This guy, this guy so he got the little illustrator creative cloud.",
    "And then at the signature.",
    "Yeah, look at all this.",
    "Gradients, appan gradients, and over other gradients.",
    "But at the master, the pencil, he's all pencil clicks.",
    "And then it creates Venus.",
    "Venus revisited, AKA creativity, takes courage and inspirational quote by Henry Matisse.",
    "And then there's still more, more more illustrations.",
    "And this is this is the actual startup screen in Adobe Illustrator 20, nine 2015.",
    "And then there it is that his work.",
    "On the website for Adobe.",
    "And when did he put this up in 2014, wow.",
    "I've been a fan of his work ever since.",
    "He is amazing.",
    "There goes the bad boys.",
    "There's the vector work.",
    "All the anchor points, that's why I screenshot on my stuff.",
    "To show you like my process in his process is amazing.",
    "Um, these are the posters, the some of the hot.",
    "Some of the responses he's gotten.",
    "And as that.",
    "But yeah, go check him out.",
    "He's amazing guy.",

    "Uh-huh do not inject yourself.",
    "That is not what's about there, we go.",
    "Heroes.",
    "Just just so flower that looks amazing, but there's the earth right there.",
    "Look at that dying to go to the beach, yeah?",
    "Oh man is simple, but to the point, in layers the gradients right there.",
    "This one should be a little.",
    "Um, straighter like all these are they all should have an angle, but anyways this is very simple.",
    "Very clean.",
    "He's been doing a lot of work.",
    "Turn soon.",
    "Yeah, he's in Bogota city, huh?",

    "Anyways I kind of went of- I started admiring his work.",
    "I want to see who the poster poster posse is or he's gonna he's gotta.",
    "Let's see what is Mo.",
    "This is, yeah, HP yeah he's a brand ambassador for HP.",
    "Uh.",
    "And then who is the poster Posse?",
    "Oh, these are a bunch of people who do posters any follow that.",
    "And then of course, that's his piece.",
    "So let's give us some love.",
    "Damn.",
    "Yeah, so you know pregnancy to global leader higher education blah blah.",
    "I don't like schools.",
    "Another school OK cool, so there it is.",
    "So yeah, there's all kinds of ways of doing shading and.",
    "What was it exactly shading in illustrator?",
    "And this is I've been taking.",
    "Notes on his work and ever since Adobe draw really came into a full vector drawing app and the Apple pencil helped with the iPad I've been, I've been chasing.",
    "The skill level that makes it fun has to level up my work, leveling out, leveling up.",
    "So here's my Sycamore there, no, no this out the way.",
    "Move this out the way.",
    "Is unlock all of these for now?",
    "Put it right here, boom, so here's the Scottley Poker.",
    "That's one of my gods.",
    "So it's got all the layers that I just showed you and then this one.",
    "I just finished the other night.",
    "It's got all kinds of gradients and shading.",
    "And then, uh, the first one I finished was hers.",
    "An excuse me, so I need to discuss a kinds of little shading details.",
    "It should be a little darker.",
    "It's kind of bright.",
    "So I play with that some more when I'm done and these guys are next.",
    "These guys were here.",
    "And this guy right there.",
    "So I'm 3 down three more to go.",
    "Oh A long ways to go.",
    "And uh, and so this one is another one that I'm working on.",
    "I started this goal with Adobe illustrator on the iPad, and uhm, I don't know how my file I just sent it to the foul.",
    "It crashed, but I was able to recover it here in illustrator so I'm very happy about that.",
    "So any case that's a little quick update on how shading works with illustrator and I see some things that I want to do with this piece.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Uh-huh yeah.",
    "This is all kinds of different styles happening here too.",
    "It needs to be more consistent in.",
    "It's not, so I'm going to have to clean up all of this, make it harder.",
    "And then, because this is very sharp, that's kind of sharp and curvy.",
    "And this needs more.",
    "Sharpness is not sharp enough, and then I'll get to the fence so that'll be another day.",
    "I need to finish that later.",
    "I got other stuff.",
    "I got this other one to do an right now what I need to work on is a logo, so let's get back into where we're here for Desi's my man.",
    "Let's see which one is which.",
    "I gotta look over here to find that file.",
    "And Elizabeth when you get done working on some of your illustrations, make sure you post them on.",
    "On behalf.",
    "'cause I'm going to go look.",
    "Alright, let's see.",
    "Was this here?",
    "There's something else I got too many windows open.",
    "There they are.",
    "So here we go.",
    "So that's the EPS that's not the one I want, so this is the one I want to write here.",
    "Logo roots.",
    "Yeah, that's the one hoping it.",
    "For some strange reason, when you're in a look at your files in windows, it doesn't show your preview, but when you look at it in a Mac, it does show you the preview.",
    "Alright, let's see.",
    "There we go.",
    "OK.",
    "Alright, so now what we're supposed to do, what I'm supposed to do is work on a Patch.",
    "And when I created this logo for rusty roots, my man Desi.",
    "Check him out, he's in Facebook in Atlanta somewhere in Georgia.",
    "I did a very hardcore.",
    "Version of the logo, right?",
    "Like like Super Deep.",
    "This is a lot of different gradients in layers and things happening.",
    "And it's cool.",
    "When using that logo for like a shirt or a banner.",
    "But once you make it smaller, you start losing a lot of the detail.",
    "Which is why then I gave him this one was that a little bit less detail, but it still has shading.",
    "I think that's what I'm gonna start then.",
    "I did us a much cleaner version where I just took away a lot of the details.",
    "And then I did another version that is way just broken down, just no cut.",
    "Noah highlights, no shading, no shadows, no nothing is just the basic colours, flat colors and so that way he can use it in many different ways.",
    "However, now it's time for another Patch and he wants to wear rusty and the word roots top and bottom.",
    "So I'm gonna draw that out.",
    "Let me see if I can.",
    "Make sure there we go.",
    "So what happened here?",
    "Alright, so.",
    "Just checking to see what happened.",
    "Bum bum bum.",
    "Kokoko, OK, that's done.",
    "Done.",
    "Alright, so.",
    "I was checking to see if Jesse was there around, but he's not, so we're going to start right here and I'm looking at the reference that he gave me.",
    "That's what it was, the reference, and he sent a message with.",
    "What he wants and how The Who wants to love it to look.",
    "So I'm going to reference it it when I need it, but right now I don't have to look at it.",
    "Somebody else there, it is right there.",
    "Boom, OK, so let's do this.",
    "So what are you gonna do then?",
    "Well first I'm gonna get rid of things that are in the way.",
    "Messing with my vision.",
    "Hum.",
    "Let me see.",
    "I should I should keep?",
    "I will keep this one.",
    "I'm going to get rid of that.",
    "Get rid of it.",
    "Get rid of that.",
    "Ann Since I'm here now.",
    "That's going to be.",
    "Is that my artboards?",
    "Select them, get rid of them.",
    "Boom As a matter of fact, OK, that's it.",
    "So now.",
    "I'm going to grab my art board.",
    "Hold on, click on this one.",
    "Hold on alt key click and drag.",
    "Hold down shift so they kind of lineup and that's it.",
    "Boom, I got 3 artboards.",
    "And so.",
    "I'm gonna work on this logo up here.",
    "And it's going to be based on this logo, while I still have this one in case I want to start with this one and start adding on to it.",
    "Which is not a bad idea.",
    "Hum.",
    "Thinking, thinking, thinking.",
    "Let's see let's go like to start taking things out.",
    "This circle gotta go.",
    "These letters got to go.",
    "A school like that.",
    "Start breaking it down.",
    "Uh-huh Boom There we go.",
    "Hum, hum.",
    "And so he said he wants the circle still.",
    "Chunky letters.",
    "Huh?",
    "Let's see.",
    "I'm watching the video that he sent me.",
    "OK.",
    "All right, there we go.",
    "He sent me a message Ann.",
    "I got it.",
    "OK cool alright so I think I have an idea what he wants so let's do this so I got rid of things that I will need.",
    "I'm going to make this a little bit smaller.",
    "Now leave it.",
    "Just leave it.",
    "It just moved a little bit.",
    "So then the room.",
    "I got it.",
    "Boom, now let's go ahead.",
    "Look at our layers are layers have three things less lokala dies down.",
    "I don't know why that happened like that was in here.",
    "Nothing OK, cool.",
    "I'll use this layer right here.",
    "And I need to type out the words restrooms.",
    "However, I forgot.",
    "What was the font that I use so hopefully?",
    "We're OK, let's get a shape.",
    "Click and drag hold down shift.",
    "Boom Huh, so this one has a gradient?",
    "Yeah.",
    "There we go, boom.",
    "Get that text.",
    "The type tool looks like a type on a path tool.",
    "Looks like the the letter tease out surfing.",
    "Click boom.",
    "Caps Rusty roots this is the word resting on top.",
    "There we go.",
    "Uh.",
    "Skip big fat letters.",
    "There we go.",
    "Iris Boom Now fix all that.",
    "Dome the word rusty.",
    "I like that font is kind of cool, but.",
    "Let's see, that's the one on take.",
    "And this is Al Farm.",
    "I've used that one before.",
    "Huh?",
    "No.",
    "Maybe go that was kind of cool.",
    "That once I impact, of course, so let's go with that.",
    "Alright, let's move it to where it goes.",
    "Where is bam?",
    "So now I'm starting to add the letters where they belong.",
    "And you'll notice that you can send it to the paragraph so it lines up in the middle and I can move my handles.",
    "Bone, so that doesn't go past this point right here.",
    "And the other one is over here, so I can make my letters bigger.",
    "Here we go.",
    "Nice, I got the rusty.",
    "Spring that over a little bit.",
    "There it is.",
    "Rust a make a copy and called an alt click and drag boom.",
    "Grab the middle line and put it right there in the bottom.",
    "And then bring that up.",
    "Uh-huh Here it is now.",
    "This rusty font size 120, so this one needs to be 120 also.",
    "Anne is going to say.",
    "Roots Bang.",
    "Let's go like that right there.",
    "An I need this one to come right there.",
    "There it is.",
    "This is rusted roots.",
    "Now let's go ahead and select those two.",
    "Annalynne Center.",
    "Center, that's not it.",
    "That's that one.",
    "There it is.",
    "Uh-huh Things.",
    "Is Canada has enough room?",
    "Uh-huh OK, do it again.",
    "Just making adjustments right now.",
    "Before I really get busy.",
    "OK, try to center.",
    "I've added a little bit.",
    "Nice yeah.",
    "There is going to get lost.",
    "What do I do?",
    "Trying to think this through?",
    "If I make my lines come out like this.",
    "And then those, and I'm going to get rid of some of these things here.",
    "OK, Alright, That's it.",
    "Let's turn that down a little bit.",
    "There it goes like it.",
    "As put that layer down here.",
    "Let's move this blank layers around bone.",
    "That's where I'm going to work at.",
    "OK, now get my pen out and what I'm gonna do is draw these letters.",
    "'cause he has an idea of what he wants an I'm going to follow that and see where it leads us.",
    "Hum.",
    "I think I made my own brush.",
    "When I did, these are.",
    "Let me see where you at brushes.",
    "Uh-huh Just the basic brush.",
    "Hum.",
    "As it should be in here, let's go ahead and unlock.",
    "This is so it's already.",
    "The brushes are no longer brush brush strokes that one is.",
    "Let's see.",
    "Is that brush?",
    "Cancel.",
    "A lot of these tools have.",
    "Partners and buddies.",
    "So I need to make my own brush right now.",
    "Yeah, so let's move.",
    "At the way.",
    "And.",
    "This grab this, get rid of that there's some brush.",
    "That's the brush.",
    "Lock it all up again, go here and let's save this time to save save S.",
    "Rusty roots Patch.",
    "It'll show your file.",
    "There it goes.",
    "There we go.",
    "What are we got?",
    "We got nobody OK got it?",
    "Now.",
    "I was going to make my brush, so let's go here here.",
    "And.",
    "Uh-huh Ever dance?",
    "Let's go ahead and get a.",
    "Stroke Huh?",
    "Fix.",
    "Boom, there it is is black.",
    "Let's make it thicker.",
    "Uh, for make it round, got it?",
    "There is another tool down here.",
    "Where are you?",
    "Oh, it's right there that one.",
    "Uh-huh Alright, is a man.",
    "Move that out the way.",
    "An when I draw I want to draw like that.",
    "So I'm gonna take this.",
    "Can I do it?",
    "Yes.",
    "There we go.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Make it right there.",
    "There it is alright, so I just made a shape or a line an I am used what you call it tool the width tool to make the tail end in a point.",
    "I have the front that starts in a curve right because that's what we have here.",
    "Well that looks like a square that's the square also.",
    "So let's fix that.",
    "I thought it was occur, but there's looks like a curve right here.",
    "All those are my.",
    "Blah brush as a blob rush.",
    "Nice alright i'ma finish my.",
    "My brush 'cause I like making brushes.",
    "Alright, so now let's go ahead here and let's make it a square.",
    "Bam square cap.",
    "There it is OK good now I can click down and select the whole thing say new brush.",
    "Art brush OK.",
    "Share card art brush one is tints and shades.",
    "Everything else is fine, my direction is to the right.",
    "I draw this way.",
    "OK, cool, done.",
    "See now watch this I click on that, um I got my brush and then I go like that.",
    "Look at that.",
    "I mean my brush brush.",
    "That's cool.",
    "Now I can grab all those, get out, they gone.",
    "I may or may not use it because now I just realized what it was supposed to be here.",
    "So give me a second, let me refresh my cup of coffee and we're going to continue on this piece.",
    "This let's go there.",
    "Turn that off.",
    "Just turn on the microphone.",
    "Got the letter Y.",
    "And if I was to.",
    "Yeah.",
    "I think that's what it was going to happen next, so I can do a thick line like this.",
    "Boom Yeah, yeah, that's what I'm after.",
    "That's the idea.",
    "The execution is really bad right now.",
    "But that's the idea.",
    "And then let's look at the thickness of these lines.",
    "So that's it.",
    "Uh-huh That said, OK cool alright take that layer, get rid of it.",
    "Yep, delete it.",
    "Near layer boom, let's go.",
    "Now we move for real.",
    "Hum.",
    "Uma.",
    "Let's go.",
    "And the layer is has a opacity.",
    "And there you go.",
    "So what I'm doing.",
    "I'm drawing the letter so they look drawn, but I'm using a actual font as a template.",
    "The only thing about illustrator.",
    "Is that you can't rotate the campus.",
    "So whichever direction the letters going, that's the direction you're going to have to draw, and it's not a good drawing situation.",
    "That's why I draw an Adobe fresco.",
    "He goes complaining already.",
    "See that right down there is complaining so already complaining,",
    "All right?",
    "Illustrated in that May for all this drawing.",
    "Is the tools are there?",
    "But that's not how you use illustrator.",
    "Are you going?",
    "Hum, hum.",
    "There it is, is coming.",
    "Hum.",
    "Maybe I can make him closer?",
    "And bigger.",
    "I'm thinking I'm thinking.",
    "Alright, let's keep rolling.",
    "I think I'm a roll with this for now.",
    "Illustrator is complaining all that rendering right there and I got a 16 gigs of ram on this computer.",
    "So I should work fine.",
    "All right, there we go.",
    "There we go.",
    "Let me get that over there.",
    "Uh-huh There you go.",
    "Alright big Big Shout out to those of you who are letting a message.",
    "Elizabeth Ann I.",
    "The Homie, whose name I can't pronounce.",
    "From China where up?",
    "And, uh.",
    "Alright, Elizabeth were at school.",
    "I'm looking at Elizabeth.",
    "Um, be hands right now.",
    "Has kind of cool.",
    "And.",
    "Mother guy he does.",
    "Other other person does not have any, uh?",
    "Projects on there be hands OK.",
    "So now.",
    "I'm going to do another layer.",
    "We are a blank layers.",
    "I think we are, Yep.",
    "Cuckoo makinilya, right there.",
    "Boom, the second layer.",
    "Then I'm making right now.",
    "This is really going to be like boom.",
    "Boom boom.",
    "Hello.",
    "Right there.",
    "So now we know what's happening.",
    "Get that blah brush.",
    "Yes.",
    "Take that one off.",
    "There you go.",
    "There you go.",
    "Woo Hoo.",
    "Alejandro Meza Looking out do you have any setting on the brush you're using which brush 'cause I got?",
    "I've been using a couple brushes.",
    "An uh, I do have a setting so number one is the blob rush.",
    "And, uh, it responds to pressure.",
    "And I have a set to three.",
    "I got the three points.",
    "I got the pressure on.",
    "I got the evaluation at three point.",
    "And so that less Maine get that second thing.",
    "Whatever I want, right?",
    "Then The other brush is my paintbrush.",
    "An I made my own brush.",
    "So right there.",
    "So that way this brush gives me that.",
    "I started off as a block.",
    "It ends in a point.",
    "There it goes.",
    "So I got a couple brushes here that I've been using.",
    "One gives me that automatic come.",
    "A hard clean lines that I can adjust, but when I'm when I'm using this brush right here, I really don't want to draw what I really want to do is do my.",
    "Anchor point my pen tool.",
    "Then I select the brush and now I have a very clean.",
    "Align versus all these anchor points right here that come when I use the brush itself.",
    "So few few things, the blob right there you go, good answer.",
    "I'm glad you told me.",
    "I just answered all of them, but the blood rushes amazing.",
    "I love the blah brush.",
    "Now you can draw anything and everything with the blob rush.",
    "And then.",
    "May the blob rush?",
    "As me.",
    "And then.",
    "Let me get this out anyway.",
    "I need the selection tool.",
    "Alright, good, now I can select the inside.",
    "Of the other shape, delete it boom gone.",
    "Select that, delete it.",
    "Is a little short cuts that you learn as time goes on among.",
    "There goes the leader.",
    "Love it back to the blob rush.",
    "Yeah, yeah, that's fine.",
    "Alright, I'm glad I you.",
    "Ask the question, Alejandro, so I can show you a few things.",
    "This is the blah blah is amazing and this is the same theory behind drawing with fresco an Adobe fresco using the.",
    "Vector brushes, because when you bring him into illustrator then that those those that artwork that you created is vector in illustrator.",
    "Eraser.",
    "Pressure.",
    "That's fine.",
    "Eraser.",
    "Huh?",
    "The other thing in illustrated you can't rotate the screen.",
    "I can rotate this, but then camera is gonna look crazy.",
    "I need to fix my eraser.",
    "Pressure is on.",
    "I know why my pressure is not working.",
    "Oh Pressure.",
    "OK.",
    "No.",
    "Let them change anything.",
    "I need to check my settings on my eraser.",
    "Hey go.",
    "Now.",
    "Thank you, Alejandro.",
    "Thank you appreciate it.",
    "There it is alright, let's get rid of that that doesn't belong in this drawing.",
    "Alright cool, so back to our regularly scheduled program.",
    "Uh, was this?",
    "That's all that little smoke.",
    "All right now it's time for some colors unless I fix this.",
    "Why this holes here?",
    "So obviously.",
    "It's fine that color eritis.",
    "Just like that.",
    "There you go.",
    "And they drop my mature love it.",
    "Alejandra says you have inspired me on creating an vector again just getting back into it.",
    "Oh good, I'm glad I was able to inspire you.",
    "'cause to me vector, there's a lot of different mediums you know in digital world, but vector allows you to use your artwork in many other ways beyond the Web, an imprint.",
    "We need a vector illustrations to be able to print out.",
    "And whatever says we want, so this is it.",
    "This is the tool you want.",
    "So I'm glad I was able to do something to get you back into vectors.",
    "I love it.",
    "Alright, let's see.",
    "That's fine.",
    "Now let's go like this.",
    "It's not like that.",
    "Is right there all of it?",
    "So.",
    "How do I get rid of that one?",
    "Eraser.",
    "There we go.",
    "Go.",
    "Does using the eraser?",
    "I could also just select them and delete.",
    "Now that I erased.",
    "Yeah.",
    "So.",
    "Those shadows are going to be.",
    "Where is it?",
    "Or is it there it is?",
    "And turned it back on.",
    "So let's grab this.",
    "Delete.",
    "All right?",
    "Erase.",
    "There we go.",
    "Gotta fix my blue.",
    "Um, where do I put the blue?",
    "It was under right here.",
    "There it is.",
    "Then is.",
    "What is that anyway?",
    "Oh, that's the inside OK good.",
    "And he got the blue.",
    "Give me another anchor point right there.",
    "A move that right there, boom boom that's it now should fix this all.",
    "This brush.",
    "What's in here?",
    "Oh that's over here, yeah?",
    "No, I'm gonna need that later.",
    "Uh, no.",
    "Yeah we will.",
    "We'll get back to that.",
    "Right now interfaces line and that's right here, yeah.",
    "Let's go.",
    "Blah brush The problem is.",
    "Um?",
    "Getting the right stroke.",
    "Hey go.",
    "Ah.",
    "There we go.",
    "Cool.",
    "Turn that off or lock it.",
    "Shading.",
    "Now, here's where.",
    "Hum.",
    "Yep.",
    "As a problem.",
    "Lock it.",
    "Again.",
    "Uh-huh Oh yeah, eraser.",
    "There we go.",
    "Nice now why?",
    "Does it look different may because of the color that I used?",
    "Let's see.",
    "Hum.",
    "Mega.",
    "Let it all match.",
    "Uh-huh Lego.",
    "And.",
    "My opacity.",
    "OK, good.",
    "That's good.",
    "I don't know why this looks different than that.",
    "0.",
    "6000 zero 6000 Oh, 'cause it does it.",
    "Have a gradient and say hello.",
    "No gradient.",
    "There's something weird about those two.",
    "I'll figure that out.",
    "Every girl but now we have.",
    "The hoses are done.",
    "Oh, let's do some more details since we're here.",
    "I don't want to go too far, but I do feel like there's something's missing.",
    "Huh?",
    "Yeah, that's not the same.",
    "What's happening here?",
    "It's not that.",
    "Yeah, they look different, oh.",
    "There it is, yeah, so those have.",
    "Transparency 57 multiply or let's go like this.",
    "There you go.",
    "I don't know how that happened.",
    "I usually.",
    "Try to make sure that all my layers in one place.",
    "Have the same.",
    "They're all the same inside of here, but the layer itself is the one that carries the transparency or something else, and in this case that happened.",
    "Why I don't know, but there it is.",
    "It's all the same now.",
    "I was going to figure it out.",
    "Alejandro says I just got my iPad pro this week in the Mail.",
    "Nice congratulations.",
    "Try not press 1 it heard it is an illustrated version for the iPad coming out soon.",
    "Do you think it would work more in Frisco or illustrator?",
    "All right?",
    "Congratulations on the iPad.",
    "I love the iPad.",
    "I love sketching and drawing on the iPad.",
    "I got three of those and there are different versions of it and I enjoy it.",
    "With the iPad, you want all of the different.",
    "Adobe apps, so get all the Adobe apps you can get fresco, including fresco.",
    "Fresco allows you to draw and vector with vector brushes.",
    "Kind of like what I'm doing right now.",
    "And was cool about that.",
    "Is there fresco you can export a PDF and open illustrator an all your vectors are alive so you can still continue drawing an doing more to the file then was available in Frisco.",
    "Fresco is still improving.",
    "There's more things happening in Frisco, so eventually you'll all the clouds.",
    "You'll be able to do more with wrestling, which you can right now is slowly building now.",
    "Illustrator for iPad is coming.",
    "I've been playing with it is I love it 'cause it'll response just like illustrator an was coming to illustrator is same thing that's happening with fresco.",
    "An photo shop is that you have creative cloud documents and I can say this to the creative cloud in illustrator.",
    "Open illustrator on the iPad and keep on working except that there's some things that are not supported in illustrator for iPad just yet.",
    "By the time it it goes live I'm sure it's going to be pretty.",
    "Khloe and Rob.",
    "Pretty robust.",
    "And we'll be able to do a lot more now like that.",
    "So.",
    "Just do what you can, what you got, but get very familiar with fresco 'cause I use fresco all the time and if you look at my um.",
    "Oh, that's nice.",
    "How did that work?",
    "OK, if you look at my big hands, you'll notice how I've been using fresco for a couple of my projects.",
    "Alot of my projects.",
    "So fresco is still a go to app right now, but I finished my artwork in illustrator.",
    "I always come back to illustrate it to finish the artwork.",
    "So there.",
    "You gotta do that.",
    "And see if this is too much.",
    "He may ask me to take some of this off, will see.",
    "Alright, so try that.",
    "Have fun with it and then check out some of my drawings that I've been doing with fresco.",
    "But yes, illustrator for iPad is coming.",
    "Oh, I can't wait for it to be ready and uh and really show off.",
    "There's a ton of.",
    "Functionality this coming to illustrator.",
    "I have 40 four.",
    "I'm checking I'm checking my transparency in some of this and that's 57.",
    "So Why is that?",
    "You know what I'm gonna do?",
    "So you know, try it out.",
    "Have fun with it and see what happens.",
    "Central a.",
    "That's what we're gonna do.",
    "Normal.",
    "Boom Then let that transparency be.",
    "Here I'm adjusting things, making it better hair.",
    "Boom that's what I meant is what I need.",
    "Why is that their color?",
    "Oh, so they still have that.",
    "But yes now.",
    "And so I use both.",
    "So just to finish talking about what you're asking me is that I use both.",
    "I use everything.",
    "I use photo shop, illustrator and um on the iPad on the on the.",
    "Does a surface on a PC, whatever I get my hands on, I do that I use it.",
    "And so just get used to it.",
    "Try it out, see how it works for you and have fun.",
    "Have fun, enjoy it.",
    "It's only going to get better an right now I'm finding out how creative cloud documents are working and uh, and that helps when you want to go from an iPad app to the desktop.",
    "It helps to be able to just jump on whichever device you want too and see how your files and work on all your files.",
    "And not worry about whether this is an app or is it is full software.",
    "There I could go on and on about this all day though as I enjoy it.",
    "I think the creative cloud is a great deal.",
    "Alright, let me move some of these things out the way.",
    "And, uh, that's it.",
    "That's it is coming.",
    "You know?",
    "That I'm here.",
    "Let me see, Yep.",
    "Let's keep working on this.",
    "Uh, in here?",
    "Yeah, let's go with them.",
    "Blah brush.",
    "So now.",
    "There you go.",
    "Is that the same color?",
    "Yeah, it's the same color.",
    "As well like that.",
    "There you go.",
    "Sign to add some elements here.",
    "And I'm using the same layer.",
    "For all of it.",
    "There you go.",
    "Please ask more questions so that I can keep on talking.",
    "I love drawing in Vector.",
    "And whatever I can do.",
    "To make it look as clean as any traditional.",
    "Illustration that that's what I'm after.",
    "There it is.",
    "Uh-huh There you go.",
    "I like drawing an well.",
    "I like illustrator for the vectors right?",
    "And then I like I'm gonna check those comments in a second and I like but I like to draw so I like the vector because of the scalability and how clean it looks.",
    "You know in the pen tool, but also like being able to draw an have that organic look and feel to it.",
    "So that's why I use.",
    "Depending on the illustration in the drawing I use a combination of.",
    "Um?",
    "The blob brush or the pen tool.",
    "However, when I'm on at all, it's all.",
    "Not a blood pressure.",
    "This vector brushes anan.",
    "It has that organic look and feel.",
    "And that's what I like about that.",
    "That's what I'm excited about fresco, and before that I was using Adobe draw.",
    "So yes, I hope you guys are enjoying the apps like I have.",
    "There we go and see the part of the organic looking feels that it looks a little rough.",
    "It doesn't have to be perfect, you know.",
    "It has a whole different feeling to the artwork and that's what I like.",
    "I want to be able to draw things that have that feel to it.",
    "Alright, let me check the comments.",
    "Let's see.",
    "Uh, AT handle says understood good good good.",
    "Marissa says I'm starting to try this area illustration do you have?",
    "Ditch for beginners so you have ditch for beginners.",
    "Explain that Marissa I don't know what that means.",
    "Maybe there's a typo in you actually wrote a different word, and then it came out looking like ditch.",
    "But My advice?",
    "For beginners is 2 number one explore the application whether you're an illustrator on a computer or illustrator.",
    "Well, one day or Adobe fresco on an iPad.",
    "Explore the app, get familiar with what is on the was available, what is it about?",
    "How does it work and then that way you're able to.",
    "Create more.",
    "And get creative nor where the tools are.",
    "So Explorer, be creative, try things out.",
    "See how they workout.",
    "Weather is the right thing or the wrong thing is though that's not what I meant to do exactly.",
    "Were you know?",
    "Just try it out.",
    "You know what we're going to do here?",
    "As let's see, Yep, this right here.",
    "So just try it out.",
    "As you trying things out.",
    "This got tricolor for now.",
    "Then practice your skills you know, figure out what is it kind of art?",
    "Do you like?",
    "What is it that you want to create?",
    "How was the art style that you're after?",
    "what I did right now is knowing these tricks help out a lot.",
    "I just copied that layer that has these letters.",
    "And then I change the color.",
    "And I'm going to start doing this.",
    "However, that's not going to work on that one.",
    "As put that back here, you have to know your little tricks.",
    "There you go.",
    "Turn that and then go like this.",
    "Pathfinder.",
    "Boom, see I got though I'm using the letters they have already withdrawn and then re using the same letters into turning into the color and then and then still bring him back to the.",
    "Outline of the letters so I don't have to redraw the actual letters.",
    "It's a little tricks and things, and that's what you learn as time goes on is How do I use different tricks, different things for drawing in illustrator that allows me to continue to create?",
    "Without uhm.",
    "Having to do things over and over and over in a way that is.",
    "Takes longer, you know, and so that's what you do in the beginning.",
    "In the beginning you test, you try and then as time goes on, you figure out your shortcuts like, oh, OK, OK.",
    "And then learn from others.",
    "Your Brazilian us OK Marissa.",
    "Well, I don't know what this dish meant, but I'm going off thinking that you meant some advice or tips, right?",
    "And so on.",
    "And so then another thing to do is to check out other artists work.",
    "There we go right there.",
    "How how did they resolve certain drawing things that right now I use the pen tool boom 'cause I can just go like this.",
    "How to other artists tackle?",
    "Certain.",
    "Illustration problems.",
    "And then what can you do?",
    "To do as good or better.",
    "Now here we're going to go like this.",
    "Every girl.",
    "Look at that.",
    "Bang damn now How do I solve this here easy?",
    "Damn there goes.",
    "Go here, put that right there, OK got that one there.",
    "Put that one there among.",
    "And now get my anchor point 2.",
    "Look at that.",
    "A combination about between the blob rush, the pen tool, all of that comes together and it's just amazing.",
    "In about how you use your layers.",
    "So I'm not going to go with that color.",
    "I need a.",
    "A lighter.",
    "There we go.",
    "That rate is too dark.",
    "So it needs to be more of a stone red.",
    "Um?",
    "Esco scarless comb Uh-huh And then apologize for your English.",
    "Will figure it out.",
    "They were tips.",
    "That's good.",
    "That's good.",
    "More so it's all good.",
    "Hopefully those tips are helpful.",
    "You let me know.",
    "And let me see what he sent me.",
    "He sent me.",
    "Hum a.",
    "I see.",
    "There it is OK.",
    "Uh-huh Yes, OK, good so I can do more details.",
    "Alright, I'm thinking about what I'm gonna do here.",
    "Oh, there's a part that needs fixing.",
    "There we go.",
    "Uh-huh Uh-huh Alright, let's do this one.",
    "Pencil, just click and drag or click click click.",
    "I can go click like this and drag.",
    "Get my keurboom it's not perfect.",
    "I'll come back to it.",
    "Uh-huh Uh-huh There you go.",
    "Hum.",
    "Not like that.",
    "And I had to fix that.",
    "There we go.",
    "Just just using the pencil is like.",
    "Um?",
    "And then it.",
    "Is like a.",
    "To connect the dots.",
    "There it goes uh-huh.",
    "Alright, let's put that down here.",
    "All right, I need another anchor under the.",
    "Yep.",
    "Anchor right here come on.",
    "Uh-huh Hum.",
    "Yeah, that goes right there.",
    "There it is.",
    "Hum a.",
    "Something's happening.",
    "There we go.",
    "Cool cool cool that's done next.",
    "I need that up.",
    "Right there.",
    "You're welcome, Marissa.",
    "You're welcome.",
    "Is take that right there?",
    "Turned out or lock it.",
    "Now grab this one.",
    "And Go like this.",
    "Boom And now.",
    "Go like that.",
    "If anybody has questions, please ask them.",
    "I'll be here pretty late.",
    "Something happened to the R.",
    "Uh-huh Oh That's that's all that's missing.",
    "Smithson apart there.",
    "So this two need to stick together.",
    "Anne will join him up like that, boom.",
    "There we go.",
    "Yes.",
    "And then this are.",
    "What is this nothing?",
    "And the and the are bring that out.",
    "But that up.",
    "There we go.",
    "It's coming along.",
    "It is rusty roots.",
    "Money I think missing a few parts.",
    "Uncommon.",
    "Let's do our save controllers to save and Simpson Coffee.",
    "Are we done?",
    "Yes, yeah, that was pretty good.",
    "And so here's where we came from from these over here.",
    "These logos over here on the left.",
    "And this is where we're going or once with the logo logo on the right.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Ooh.",
    "I'm noticing a couple of things that I need to fix.",
    "Right there.",
    "Let's fix that real quick.",
    "Look eraser.",
    "Uh-huh Uh-huh Move the anchor points.",
    "Boom done.",
    "Ooh I love it alright I was working on highlights.",
    "Is there some highlights so I pick out a white color, get my blah brush?",
    "Me.",
    "Mega fat and then thin it out.",
    "Uh-huh Uh-huh There you go.",
    "I like it.",
    "I like it.",
    "Hey Jimena.",
    "Jimenez as saying, wow, I love the design.",
    "Thank you very much and another video.",
    "Can you show this in 3D?",
    "I don't do 3D.",
    "I don't use a 3D functions an illustrator.",
    "I am a 2D illustrator.",
    "I like to draw.",
    "And I can make it, you know, give that the illusion of the 3D.",
    "But I'm not going to draw in 3D.",
    "Uh, I can't think of a illustrator who has something on line that you can find.",
    "I'm sure there's somebody here annum.",
    "Anna.",
    "What do you call it be, hence?",
    "Who killed who has something like that?",
    "Can't think of who right now.",
    "A poltrona he's always shown something off within constant illustrator.",
    "Always.",
    "Check him out part, Ronnie.",
    "He is an official.",
    "Um?",
    "Create a cloud.",
    "An evangelist like he is, he knows everything about illustrator.",
    "So check him out.",
    "Hey man eyes asking another question, can I tell you something about graphic design?",
    "Ask me a specific question, I'll tell you about it.",
    "And while I wait for you to give me actual question, I'll tell you a couple of things.",
    "Number one.",
    "Figure out what kind of design you like.",
    "Is it uhm?",
    "And it has to do like the type a branding or clientele.",
    "Right, do you want to do design?",
    "For a dozen top.",
    "Something is that with these letters.",
    "You want to do design for hospitals.",
    "You know you got to think about who you are.",
    "There it is right there?",
    "Say who do you want to do?",
    "Design work for?",
    "Type of company type of.",
    "Organizations you know understand who you want to have, who you want your client to be, because opportunity is going to come your way.",
    "People with money may come your way.",
    "People with that money is going to come your way.",
    "And, uh, and you had to be ready to choose the different kinds of designs that are out there.",
    "The design work that you do for Coca-Cola is different than what you do for the hospital.",
    "You know loop, so the design work that you do for.",
    "Like a government agency.",
    "Is different than what you do for a construction company.",
    "Then what you do for real estate company?",
    "So understanding the place of Design in each of those.",
    "Industries will give you the chance to figure out well.",
    "do I want to try it?",
    "They wanna draw or design for buildings all day everyday.",
    "Do I want to do something fun for like Netflix?",
    "You know all of those things and even working for Netflix, they'll be different departments.",
    "There could be a department for social media department for.",
    "Marketing too.",
    "Marketing materials for the public marketing materials for, uh.",
    "Enter into Department design.",
    "So think about design in terms of what are the jobs out there an what would I do with that?",
    "This side with that and once you establish that, then your portfolio needs to reflect that.",
    "And so if you want to, let's say work for Coca Cola.",
    "What is I don't think Coca-Cola designs in your portfolio.",
    "They don't cost you anything is if you're in school or if you're trying to just build your portfolio, then you do that.",
    "And then share some of that design work that you're doing.",
    "Share it.",
    "Some of that share some of that in your.",
    "Um?",
    "Share it on social media.",
    "So then when people see it.",
    "The companies can see it.",
    "You tag them.",
    "The companies will see it and be loud.",
    "Why does this person not have a job with us?",
    "This give this person a job.",
    "And then that's how that takes off.",
    "But you have to understand what kind of design you're going to work with or you want to work with.",
    "Not all designers are the same.",
    "Not all designers have the same style.",
    "Some designers like to solve problems and to design.",
    "Create the French design that doesn't exist anywhere, and then there's some designers would like to see a template and say you know well, let me just adjust that and then that's what I'm going to use to work on this project.",
    "And I know both kind of designers on the kind of designer the lights to work on with problems with problems.",
    "And then say, OK, well how can I adjust this?",
    "How can I take take this message?",
    "And then.",
    "Make sure is the design reflects the message.",
    "And once I get that problem, solvers like cool now I don't want to do the rest of the designs like I want to.",
    "I want to come up with the branding design.",
    "And then let somebody else.",
    "Design all the other assets that are required, not me.",
    "'cause then to me that's boring.",
    "So that's a little bit on that.",
    "If you have other any specific questions and please ask it an I will get on it.",
    "Look at that, yes.",
    "So I'm going to.",
    "I need to.",
    "I'm going to do a couple more things to it and then that's it.",
    "I need to send this off to Desi.",
    "Let him look at it and tell me that he doesn't like it.",
    "And that is not what he wants.",
    "And then I had to draw this again.",
    "He says it in a nice way.",
    "So we're OK, let me see where is that layer?",
    "There it is.",
    "Let's go with that.",
    "Huh?",
    "Let's go here.",
    "Blah brush",
    "Humana if you have.",
    "A specific questions asked.",
    "Ask me if you want.",
    "Understand Typography.",
    "Understand they use a fonts.",
    "It looks rusty.",
    "Um?",
    "In our like this design, Scott Rusty Roots.",
    "As a service.",
    "That, UM.",
    "Caters to Restoration.",
    "So, so the idea is to give it a sense of were taking something that's rusty.",
    "And making a fresh and clean.",
    "And so yeah, you know.",
    "So very messy looking design.",
    "You want to understand.",
    "How?",
    "2.",
    "Visualize a message.",
    "There we go.",
    "Boom Boom I like it.",
    "I like it.",
    "Yeah, let me know which I think if this, uh, this is cool or not.",
    "You are done for tonight.",
    "Hello, Heaven on.",
    "Uh, two hours.",
    "That's good time.",
    "That's a good time.",
    "Anybody got some questions or suggestions?",
    "Please drop it in the comments in the chat I will answer, let's go ahead and clean up this file.",
    "Make sure that there's nothing here that I don't need.",
    "And.",
    "Let's take a look at where we started from.",
    "I took this design on the left.",
    "And I created the design on the right.",
    "Look at that.",
    "This is the old logo or the original logo.",
    "I'm at designed that logo and now all this is what the logo looks like.",
    "Oh yeah.",
    "Hum.",
    "I'ma keep 'em all here, I need him.",
    "There's something I need to do here is kind of weird.",
    "What do I do?",
    "Think about that.",
    "Maybe I do another version?",
    "I know what.",
    "I need to not have this go down this way.",
    "Alright, so let's take a look at that.",
    "Let's go.",
    "Alright, lock these layers.",
    "I'm not done.",
    "Boom Lock the layers you don't need.",
    "There it is.",
    "Hum.",
    "Once I cut that off right there.",
    "That's going to cut that.",
    "Here we go.",
    "No.",
    "There we go.",
    "There it is.",
    "Yep.",
    "And that's actually going to help this area breathe.",
    "Other things that we do.",
    "I could have been done.",
    "I've had it wrapped it up and went home.",
    "Alright, any idea or suggestion about Lang?",
    "Wait yes, and I wish I could say your name.",
    "I'm sorry I cannot read.",
    "Any other languages except for English and Spanish.",
    "Or any I can read?",
    "I can read words that have the alphabet that I'm used to, but let's get back to the question.",
    "The language it is going to depend.",
    "On the R style.",
    "That you're after.",
    "Like this, we wanted to be very bold.",
    "Very young.",
    "AMA here we go.",
    "Wow.",
    "Very yeah.",
    "Curtis.",
    "We kind of wanted to.",
    "Have a fun, dirty grimy, dirty style.",
    "So that's why it has a lot of bold lines, however.",
    "You're lying weights in this inside area are going to be different than the outside area.",
    "Why is this?",
    "This has, uh?",
    "Yeah, there you go.",
    "And so you had to pay attention to the line weights.",
    "And the inside of a shape.",
    "Or a object?",
    "Because I'm outside, lines are the ones are gonna be more dramatic and bold to bring in the whole thing into focus.",
    "And so like here this line.",
    "It's a different in weight than the lines that on the outside.",
    "And you have to think about that as your drawing something.",
    "Because you want to be able to.",
    "Make things fit now just because that's that works for one R style doesn't mean that that's what we do with all other ourselves.",
    "Some are cells are going to be different in others, you're going to need a different.",
    "Line weights.",
    "Some drawings have the same line.",
    "Wait all the way through.",
    "It all depends on the R style too.",
    "Alright, I think that's this one, yeah?",
    "Where is this?",
    "Oh yeah, I need that.",
    "OK.",
    "So so you know, it's really depends on what you're doing.",
    "And you need to have examples of what you're working on sometimes.",
    "I will research.",
    "Other artists work.",
    "And try to figure out how they did something.",
    "Like how did you do that?",
    "And then I'll and then I spend time.",
