    "I was getting ready to sit down and draw like Nope.",
    "I'm going to stream turn on the camera.",
    "Let's do it.",
    "How's your evening going?",
    "But Pumpkin, I understand you gotta Bury your poop, but you don't have to go that crazy.",
    "It's my cat and sorry if you hear the scratching in the background.",
    "Just having a little bit of fun is all I'm doing.",
    "Trying different ways to draw.",
    "Or at least color.",
    "His coloring is honestly one of my favorite things to do, and I often get very easily distracted.",
    "I'll be halfway through my line work and then just start coloring and then it's like, well, How do I?",
    "How do I catch up on my line art?",
    "Are you using regular Photoshop brushes or your own?",
    "These ones are from.",
    "Moyshe Elo I SH.",
    "She has her brushes on Gumroad.",
    "Brushes I think you can are there.",
    "Are they on deviant art?",
    "See.",
    "There.",
    "Let's see if I can find the link for you.",
    "By other voices brushes out here they are.",
    "They were the second thing I supposed to look at.",
    "Here we go.",
    "You can download them for free, or you can pay like $2 to get them.",
    "I just would like how the the consistency is with the brushes and you can very easily just turn on the transfer and just really get that different kind of appearance with them.",
    "Merge group.",
    "I'm also one of those artists who super ridiculously about my color lining up perfectly with the line art.",
    "Like right in here 'cause the.",
    "Other than that it has that little difference.",
    "I'm super about that.",
    "It's goofy.",
    "How much that bugs me.",
    "But this is what I do to kind of combat that.",
    "Save your stuff if you're if you're drawn as well.",
    "Um?",
    "Beginner in trying and wondering if using pen tablets will enhance my work.",
    "I talked about the tablets like like that have the screen on it or like what I have where I'm drawing here, but my screen is here.",
    "Because the one I have.",
    "I don't think it will mess with anything.",
    "This is the one that I have is just the way come into OSX.",
    "I've been using these kinds of tablets for I think.",
    "At least the past.",
    "Eight years or so since I think my sophomore or junior year of high school and it's definitely hard to get used to because.",
    "You're you're drawing here, but you're looking there so you have to learn a lot of hand eye coordination habits.",
    "Um, which can be kind of a pain in the butt.",
    "You know, but the more you practice, the more you.",
    "You know, try to get it down.",
    "It will slowly begin to make a difference.",
    "I'm going to switch this over here so you guys are not this feedback that whole thing.",
    "There we are.",
    "Huh?",
    "And then just to stay within that what I'll do is I'll use the wand tool.",
    "Which I just have W.",
    "And then wherever I draw on this layer, it won't leave that spot.",
    "The ones not with the screen.",
    "Yeah, these ones I mean.",
    "A tablet is a tablet in my opinion, 'cause I've used the ones with the screen on it and they are amazing to use their.",
    "They are a little bit different because I'm so used to this kind.",
    "That when I did start drawing, you know on the screen I notice myself kind of falling into the habits that I had.",
    "Um?",
    "When I would draw on paper where I'd have like the paper here and I would be like this, you know, like zooming in really close, but with this one.",
    "Having taught myself and built up the habit of.",
    "You not having to look at my hand to draw an using the commands to Z to zoom in and that kind of thing.",
    "It has helped a lot.",
    "But one thing to to remember is every artist kind of has their own.",
    "Little vied that they kind of fall into, you know?",
    "Um?",
    "Into us is or what.",
    "I've just gotten used to and that's what I like I do enjoy the ones with screens, but.",
    "First of all, they're so expensive, so so so so pricey, and that's not money that I have, unfortunately.",
    "So the intuos works just fine for me.",
    "You know, the not looking at your hand while you're drawing.",
    "Is a pain to get over.",
    "I remember being so frustrated when I first started drawing with these tablets.",
    "You know, not being able to look down here, you know that this Association.",
    "Of not having to look at your hand was such a pain to get over, but once I did.",
    "Nothing can stop me.",
    "You know, I was, I could go and draw and do anything I wanted.",
    "What are you using to draw now?",
    "You like that yellow needs to kind of be over here.",
    "Exactly, yeah, there we go.",
    "OK.",
    "I think for me.",
    "In all the years that I have been drawing.",
    "Having the like the Sid kik would be.",
    "It would be nice to have because then I can use it as another screen.",
    "But with the way that my life is now.",
    "And with my finances and being clip see, you know, having a centriq isn't exactly the smartest idea for myself.",
    "And plus, God forbid when you do.",
    "Using a mouse to draw.",
    "You're a wizard.",
    "Good Sir or Madame?",
    "I could not.",
    "I've tried the mouse thing before.",
    "I wanted to throw myself across the room.",
    "Sketch on the paper, then draw on top of it.",
    "OK, gotcha.",
    "I used to do that and then once I started getting into doing digital art, I learned of the wonderful magic of command Z, which is the undo button.",
    "Which is an absolute gods, and I don't think I could ever go back to the two traditional media.",
    "I get too frustrated over.",
    "Not being able to erase or undo the mistake that I just made.",
    "But that's actually how a lot of people do.",
    "Start out.",
    "I remember when I was going to college back in 2011.",
    "That's how it was for me.",
    "At least with the.",
    "The tablet in the pen.",
    "I would say it does kind of emulate more of the.",
    "Traditional.",
    "Sensation.",
    "Of drawing if that's the right verbiage to use.",
    "'cause you're sitting here and you're still moving your hand as if you're drawing you're pushing down.",
    "You know you're like.",
    "Dragging the pen across slightly to create a thin line, you're pressing down harder to create a thicker line kind of thing.",
    "Shapes.",
    "Are there.",
    "Brushstrokes?",
    "OK, gotcha.",
    "Work smarter, not harder.",
    "Dude, no that smart.",
    "I would be the person who's like no way in there.",
    "Trying really hard to.",
    "Just get every line perfect.",
    "I would say for me the very first tablet that I had was a Wacom bamboo.",
    "It's like it's very similar to us in Teak.",
    "I don't think it has as many like pressure pen pressure.",
    "What's the word like?",
    "Sensitivities?",
    "If that's the right term to use?",
    "But that's that's what I started with an that that tablet lasted me.",
    "Until about what I got it in.",
    "Where did I get that?",
    "I'd say 2010 thousand 11.",
    "That thing lasted me until.",
    "2017 So it lasted me forever.",
    "But then my Wacom does the into it.",
    "I got after that one busted and.",
    "They do last long.",
    "And if you're kind of a klutz like myself, if you're prone to having your drinks close by while you're working.",
    "And you wind up spilling on your tablet.",
    "I've done that before with an intuos.",
    "Thankfully, it's not going to like and I.",
    "You know?",
    "You've got a little bit of mercy, at least.",
    "With the into with the centriq, I feel like that thing would just.",
    "Sizzle, pop, and blow up.",
    "Here we are.",
    "But I will say getting any kind of art tablet will definitely make.",
    "Doing digital art a lot easier.",
    "That's not the president wanted.",
    "OK.",
    "That's all I wanted.",
    "Why can't wanna let me?",
    "Oh, that way odd, that's why OK.",
    "And I wanna come over here and.",
    "That color.",
    "But no matter where you are in your artistic development.",
    "There's so many things that you can learn that'll that'll just change.",
    "Everything that you think you know about how art is done, but the great thing about doing art like this is there's so many ways to do the same thing.",
    "And you get to have the opportunity to figure out how are you going to do?",
    "How are you going to create your art?",
    "You know?",
    "Like for me I have a lot of people think I'm nuts 'cause I have all these layers over here and for me this is just how I organize things inside my own head while I'm working, you know.",
    "And then at the end when I'm finished with everything, I'll put all the lineout layers together.",
    "I'll put all the color layers together so I don't have such a large.",
    "File, you know?",
    "And that's that's the cool thing about all this stuff.",
    "Is there so many ways?",
    "To do one thing.",
    "I really like that actually.",
    "Here we go.",
    "I use Pinterest for everything and anything which is a good an horrible thing because Pinterest will suck you in and you'll be trapped in it forever.",
    "But going to something like that I don't know will that work.",
    "OK, yeah.",
    "So just look up anatomy or poses anatomy poses.",
    "I think that's the right kind of term.",
    "Yeah, anatomy poses and you can look at, you know people standing in a certain way, hands you know in like postures and things like that.",
    "That way you can trace it, understand it and then put it off to the side and redraw it.",
    "Use it as reference, you know.",
    "So to an extent, do I think tracing is bad.",
    "It is.",
    "But it isn't.",
    "You can learn how to draw by tracing, but don't go around stealing people stuff OK?",
    "If I find out you're stealing people stuff, I might have to hunt you down and beat you up.",
    "But to learn to teach yourself, to educate yourself on how does this work, you know.",
    "That's that's what I recommend doing.",
    "The color that I wanted.",
    "I wanted that.",
    "Really, really liked.",
    "Do you have the discord link, so I can give my drawings?",
    "Take your opinions, yeah I have I have.",
    "The the hands discord.",
    "If you have to be hands discord.",
    "Uh.",
    "You can just send me a message to their.",
    "I think I don't know can I add people?",
    "Up Let's see.",
    "I don't speak English, but I want you to know that I love your work.",
    "You're drawings are.",
    "Beautiful and I loved your ear.",
    "I don't know if they're real bugs.",
    "Very beautiful.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Know their actually.",
    "Uhm, little silicone elf ears.",
    "But I actually ordered them up like earlier this month, 'cause I.",
    "Madhouse.",
    "They don't have the headsets work OK.",
    "Uh.",
    "I actually got these ears.",
    "From let me find the link, there were like $15.00 with shipping, which isn't well American USD dollars but.",
    "Madhouse.",
    "FX studio.",
    "They're the ones who sell these ears, and they just might creep out people.",
    "It's just easy to little tug off, but it just like rests over your ears and I use eyelash glue for make up to make him stick to my ear.",
    "Buttom But see if I can send you.",
    "Up wrong one.",
    "Hang on doodle Doo Doo coffee.",
    "OK.",
    "Send I think it's OK that I invite you to this.",

    "Victoria.",
    "I hope I say it right.",
    "For Hello, Welcome to my stream.",
    "Oh it's alright.",
    "I could, I could always take it through Google Translate.",
    "How can I join?",
    "'cause Pablo Picasso?",
    "A problem across so, uh.",
    "Pedro Pascal Jiminy Christmas as the mandalorian is ridiculously handsome an I can't help myself.",
    "So I've got my friend of Voodoo Val on here who's she is an amazing artist.",
    "And possibly the biggest Star Wars nerd on the face of the planet.",
    "And she and she was telling me all kinds of lore about the Star Wars Universe.",
    "That does not include the Skywalker family, and I was like Oh my gosh wow wow blah blah an uhm.",
    "Val and I have been talking about setting up our own Dungeons and Dragons group for a long period of time and the idea kind of hit me like man value know a lot about Star Wars, like, why don't, why don't we set up a thing where we do like a Star Wars group.",
    "The Star Wars D&D 'cause I love Dungeons and Dragons I've I've only been playing it for about a year now.",
    "Much.",
    "This August will be two years.",
    "But unfortunately the virus it's been a little difficult for me in my current group to get together and I was like man, what if?",
    "What if we do like a Star Wars thing.",
    "You know, like can you help me build a character and stuff like that?",
    "And she was like yes so.",
    "I came up with a togruta.",
    "I believe that I'm saying it right.",
    "I unfortunately live in America and we don't know how to say things properly.",
    "So yeah, so this is just a little fun character.",
    "That I've been playing with on and off.",
    "And I'd like to do the bust.",
    "And.",
    "Then maybe within the next couple days or so, go in and um, like, come up with a costume or something you know like what's what's this girls back story?",
    "I know her to turn name is Mahala Naza.",
    "I went to a Star Wars name generator.",
    "'cause I don't.",
    "I don't know enough about Star Wars names that are that.",
    "I just so fun and creative.",
    "I can't come up with something like that off the top my head so I just went through and I picked out like a bunch of names that I just went through and said all of them.",
    "And so the first names I really like.",
    "But the last names I really didn't.",
    "So then I would say the first name with a different last name.",
    "You know that kind of thing?",
    "Sending my drawing.",
    "You can review.",
    "Yeah yeah go ahead.",
    "Greg.",
    "I like them.",
    "I really like your use of texture.",
    "That's so cool.",
    "Oh I like the cat, is that supposed to be like a little coffee shop that the guys in or something?",
    "I see the calendar.",
    "That's really good, especially for just using your mouse and shaping tools.",
    "Those are amazing.",
    "I really like the style that is so cute.",
    "I love it.",
    "I need to improve my English.",
    "I still don't understand you.",
    "Everything you say.",
    "Oh no, I'm sorry.",

    "So I apologize if I get to chat and too much.",
    "Kareena coffee shop.",
    "Oh how cool.",
    "I really like it.",
    "I would say Yeah, You, You seem to really have an art style that works.",
    "There's just I would say definitely getting getting a drawing tablet like an intuos would definitely help you know.",
    "Adjust like kind of make things go faster and even then with the with the intuos pen you can still use the shape tools and stuff like that.",
    "Um?",
    "Until really Um?",
    "You know?",
    "Get your anatomy down and things like that, but yeah, you've got you've got it down really well so far.",
    "Keep going man I love it.",
    "See how I'm like being super finicky about every brush line.",
    "This is just.",
    "So that I love doing I love coloring.",
    "Staying in the lines.",
    "Uh-huh Excuse me, I'm Burpee.",
    "I had all kinds of soda pop.",
    "Are there still drinking soda?",
    "What am I saying?",
    "I really like her.",
    "She's so sad.",
    "Or is she looks like she's grumpy?",
    "I'm in focus mode, I'm sorry.",
    "I'm a computer engineer.",
    "A little bit of time, but I loved designing rather than this job.",
    "Considering moving to designing.",
    "Oh wow.",
    "I said being an engine.",
    "I mean I would.",
    "I would think being a computer engineer.",
    "I would think that's a pretty good deal like that blah blah blah blah.",
    "I lost track of my words that for a minute you know I would.",
    "I would think it's a pretty good paying job.",
    "But yeah, if it's not what you're happy with.",
    "You know?",
    "There's nothing wrong with.",
    "Trying new things and trying to figure out what it is that you know.",
    "The calling that you have in life.",
    "You know?",
    "There's nothing wrong with taking a risk and.",
    "Trying something new, the only thing that I would say is if you do want to try something new, just make sure you're being smart about it.",
    "You know that would be the best advice that I could give just to be safe, you know.",
    "I didn't expect this time to have curse words, I'm sorry.",
    "Uh.",
    "Let's see.",
    "There we are.",
    "Let's see What is this?",
    "Let's do that.",
    "OK.",
    "Is the music at a, uh, OK volume for you guys?",
    "Yeah, it looks like it's a little quiet.",
    "There we are.",
    "All right?",
    "Now that quarantine, just starting to lighten up a little bit here in California have been drinking a lot more soda.",
    "Then before, so I'm kind of regretting it a little bit.",
    "For her on my nose, please excuse me in it.",
    "With the cat hair I know it is.",
    "Only my cats hair sticks to my nose like this.",
    "She's she's a my cat is a long hair orange tabby.",
    "And she she really likes to.",
    "Just lay.",
    "All over my stuff if I'm over here doing my makeup, she'll come over and rub her face against my makeup brushes.",
    "And she drives me nuts.",
    "But I love her.",
    "She's my baby.",
    "OK, good.",
    "I don't like.",
    "Keep thinking I see someone outside.",
    "Had done to her.",
    "Here we are.",
    "Super finicky about making sure that the coloring is done perfectly.",
    "I don't know why.",
    "'cause honestly no reason for me to be so finicky.",
    "I think it's because for me when I look at someone's drawings, I look really close at the line work.",
    "I look at the coloring.",
    "I look at everything.",
    "And so because of that you know, and I look closely, not too.",
    "You know, critique or judge someone's art.",
    "You know, for the tiny details, I just.",
    "I like looking really close like this, you know, looking at the tiny details.",
    "All over the place.",
    "But I think because I've taught myself to do that.",
    "I really, really.",
    "Judge myself very hard core about.",
    "Um?",
    "My own stuff and I worry about those super tiny miniscule details that others don't really think about.",
    "OK.",
    "OK.",
    "Like in here.",
    "You know someone's going to be looking this close.",
    "But this is just what I do.",
    "This is what I taught myself to do.",
    "Let me clarify that I've taught myself to look this close.",
    "When honestly I think I'm the only person who really does that.",
    "There we go.",
    "And yes, you don't even like I was resumed in here super close.",
    "Don't even see all those tiny details.",
    "I know I don't.",
    "The only reason why I do is because I've looked super close.",
    "Come on now, let's see.",
    "This is my first rough sketch.",
    "I want to grab that color too.",
    "So that's my rough sketch.",
    "And then this is the revised version, so there's nothing ever wrong with going back and.",
    "Redrawing something, going over it again to make it more refined, do the tiny details you know, like.",
    "You know this one.",
    "Compared to that, this one is a little bit more messy.",
    "The lines are thicker.",
    "It's kind of more just thrown on there.",
    "I called this phase the spaghetti on the wall face an that's just a reference, like when you cook spaghetti noodles.",
    "You know when they're done by picking them up and throwing them at the wall.",
    "If they stick, their done.",
    "If they don't, it's not done, and this is kind of the not sticking part, but I decided to go in.",
    "At a later date and just clean it up a little bit, you know that's just stuff that there's nothing ever wrong with doing that.",
    "Because then, as your free drawing that you can think, oh, you know there's something else I need to add in here, or you notice something inconsistent with the anatomy or whatever.",
    "That's just what I do.",
    "I just think that I'm also, you know, kind of crazy.",
    "There we are.",
    "But it's also just stuff that I I personally enjoy.",
    "I like going in really close and making sure that everything is.",
    "You know, really, really filled in.",
    "Hope.",
    "Here we go.",
    "Just like that.",
    "That kind of changes a whole lot about.",
    "Her headpiece and the patterns anyway?",
    "212 is this.",
    "Hello.",
    "Actually, right now I could just do it with this.",
    "Now I'm just going to leave it.",
    "I had an idea but I'm just I'm thinking too hard.",
    "And sometimes you gotta catch yourself thinking really hard.",
    "And then you're like, why am I thinking so hard?",
    "Get yourself out of it.",
    "OK.",
    "Then Yeah.",
    "That I don't know what that button was, but.",
    "When in doubt, Control Z.",
    "I have no idea what I just did.",
    "That was slightly nerve wrecking.",
    "Oh my goodness.",
    "We are color in her eyes.",
    "And I'm going to change that because that is too white.",
    "Is that?",
    "Yeah.",
    "Remember the whites of the eyes aren't truly white.",
    "There we are, so see that kind of softened up a lot of stuff in there.",
    "You Line.",
    "Oh my gosh.",
    "Hum.",
    "I really like those colors.",
    "Up I might come back.",
    "Tomorrow, and that's when I'll design her outfit.",
    "One thing I'm trying to start teaching myself to do is do more character design stuff, like if you if you go online to Pinterest, Google whatever an you look up character design sheets, you'll see little bus like this where it had, they had different expressions, you know they might be in a different pose, they'll be in motion.",
    "That kind of thing and character design is something that I love doing.",
    "I loved designing characters, but I have to start.",
    "Handling each character.",
    "As if they were going to be animated or putting a show or whatever and have all those tiny details you know, like a character sheet would have.",
    "But also, here's Maine.",
    "Remember that tiny details like this aren't always necessary.",
    "'cause That's my biggest struggle is I love the tiny details.",
    "All that stuff.",
    "An since character design isn't that I want to get into.",
    "You don't have to do tiny details to make it make sense, otherwise it's going to kind of make.",
    "Animating kind of tough, you know.",
    "One thing I do.",
    "Is.",
    "Search crew.",
    "This is just something weird that I like to do that can kind of get the line art to blend a little more.",
    "I want to do this.",
    "Turn that down just a tiny bit.",
    "Boo.",
    "That one I like is very soft though.",
    "Do the green.",
    "I like the green.",
    "That's just only like a little fun thing to do.",
    "So when you're doing lineart When you're done with it, just like how I did, you know here.",
    "With this, if you copy the line art and you make it that purple.",
    "Like this or you could you could do purple.",
    "You can do any color really.",
    "Just like that and like what I did.",
    "Is you keep, you know the other one.",
    "You can keep the.",
    "The line art layers themselves colored, or you can do black-and-white.",
    "I've seen that done before.",
    "Merge that it's actually see.",
    "So now I just colored all the line art.",
    "I've got this one on top.",
    "I think it's such a.",
    "It's such a weird thing.",
    "I gotta remember how to do it.",
    "So yeah, so if you have one version of the liner, all colored black and another one this colored purple and you come over here to the side, and you do these different layer options, you can kind of go through and see.",
    "How it colors the line art?",
    "It's actually kind of cool sometimes.",
    "Who like that?",
    "That's cool.",
    "You know, but for me.",
    "I already had my line art here.",
    "So I think I liked.",
    "It was a difference, or was it divide?",
    "No, I like.",
    "I think it was different and then just play with the opacity of it.",
    "Like how you know bright or dark it is.",
    "And it can add a lot of character.",
    "To the line art.",
    "So now here she's more like yellow blue, with just aligner allowed.",
    "Now she looks more green.",
    "This is what I love doing and it's just it's playing is just playing around, just poking at things here on photo shop.",
    "You never know what you can come up with.",
    "One thing I am curious about though, is.",
    "Hum.",
    "Now I like him.",
    "I like him blue like her head piece.",
    "I am.",
    "Gotta take my select tool.",

    "If I can hit the right buttons here, there we are.",
    "There.",
    "Merge merge.",
    "There we go, I said just a little bit more.",
    "Darker as a color.",
    "Whoops",
    "Yeah, so let her eyes aren't as intense.",
    "I kind of like the purple.",
    "That's cool.",
    "OK.",
    "Then I'm just going to be weird for half a second.",
    "There we are.",
    "Heavy R.",
    "All right?",
    "There, so it's not all inconsistent untextured in there.",
    "And now we can also be fun to do.",
    "Is to do this?",
    "Ha ha.",
    "Just color the liner.",
    "This is that weird stuff that I like doing that you honestly don't have to do if you don't want to.",
    "I'm just.",
    "Goofball who likes?",
    "Doing this kind of stuff.",
    "That male voice was kind of creepy.",
    "I wasn't expecting that, but.",
    "Weird things happen.",
    "Yeah, see that already.",
    "Kind of like just makes the tech the patterns.",
    "Kind of travel across her her head piece there.",
    "Montreal, I think that's what it's called for them.",
    "Star Wars aliens are always so strange to me.",
    "I remember being a kid 'cause I like Star Wars.",
    "But I didn't understand anything.",
    "You know, like I had reached by the time I saw Star Wars for the first time I was at that stage in life where you know villains can be villains, but but why you know I wanted to know those things and.",
    "You know why is there such thing as before?",
    "So what is the force do an my dad who was a huge huge Star Wars nerd while I was growing up.",
    "Couldn't really answer those questions, or at least he didn't really want to.",
    "So I was really confused and upset for a long time so I just didn't care about Star Wars because no one can answer the questions that I had.",
    "All I knew was that pad may amidala.",
    "From the prequels was in my absolute favorite because she had the craziest jewelry and makeup ever and I wanted to be her so bad when I was a little girl and.",

    "Huh?",
    "So the only thing that one can think is that their blood is still red, so therefore she would still have.",
    "Um?",

    "Z.",
    "Fan.",

    "Like a higher chance of getting sunburnt like here on your forehead, the bridge of your nose, the cheap, the highrises of your face.",
    "So that's what I always do.",
    "As I would, I always like to add blush in those parts of the body.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Someone is beeping at me.",
    "And then what I can do all that so cute?",
    "And then.",
    "Tone it down just a little bit.",
    "Green blush OK.",
    "And.",
    "Uh.",
    "Nope.",
    "There we are kind of just pointed out a little bit.",
    "Can you zoom into the eyes one more time?",
    "Yeah, yeah.",
    "At.",
    "So I did the eyes really simple I I've been trying to make it a habit of mine from now on where when I do with the whites of the eyes I don't make it white.",
    "I kind of pick the skin tone and I come over here to the color palette.",
    "Like you know that's the skin tone an I usually try to stick.",
    "In this area right here for the whites of the eyes and.",
    "For the eyes, I just did very simple.",
    "I don't know what's one mile in here.",
    "I just took.",
    "The color of the iris.",
    "Like this and then I brought it down.",
    "You know I'll vary depending on how intensely I want to color in the eyes and I'll bounce somewhere.",
    "You know, in the dark array region.",
    "I'll use the soft around Airbrush and kind of just go.",
    "Here over the top of the eye around.",
    "That kind of thing.",
    "I'll color in the pupil a little bit.",
    "That's really dark.",
    "Little bit more definition in the pupil there just like that.",
    "And then I had this very subtle little dot here.",
    "Just to kind of add a little bit of highlight to the eyes.",
    "You know 'cause the eyes aren't always one color.",
    "There's many colors with an iris and then.",
    "I'll take the.",
    "Color of the white of the eyes, and then I'll go in, and I'll do these little highlights.",
    "And it kind of gives it that depth.",
    "You know, it's a new habit I'm trying to build, but it does add a lot of character.",
    "You know?",
    "You get a little bit of you, get a little bit of an idea of what she's really like.",
    "There we go.",
    "I'll never forget I was watching something.",
    "I think it was Glenn teen on the animator behind The Little Mermaid, the Beast in beauty and the Beast Tarzan.",
    "So many other characters of Disney and I've looked up to him ever since.",
    "I was very young.",
    "I remember in an interview, Glen Keane once said, you know, you can make a mistake on anywhere else on the character, but don't mess up on the eyes because that's where people look too.",
    "To see it into the soul of that character.",
    "And it's like when you're talking with people you make eye contact, you know, and you really want to make sure that you can get that personality in there, you know.",
    "And it's it's hard.",
    "It's very hard to try to get the right kind of look 'cause to me she looks a little like her face, her expression.",
    "She has sad eyes, but she's she's a little bit of anger in her.",
    "You know, and you could see something completely different, you know.",
    "So that's that's what's so interesting about art and character design is I could have something you know set up and I could see it my way.",
    "And then you can perceive in a completely different way.",
    "Doctor Pepper I'm not to call it soon.",
    "OK.",
    "Another thing I might do is.",
    "New layer clipping mask.",
    "I grab that purple.",
    "And one way to make shading.",
    "Easy, ish easier.",
    "Um?",
    "It's not just using color theory, but this is kind of like a shortcut.",
    "I always pick this kind of purple color or somewhere around this area and I'll go through and not just kind of draw a line just like that.",
    "Let me make sure I don't have let me turn off transfer.",
    "OK, like that.",
    "And then what I'll do is I'll go through.",
    "The line settings here and you can see how it reacts.",
    "And sometimes you can find the right option.",
    "That kind of creates like a shadow almost.",
    "Or even a highlight.",
    "Or not.",
    "Since you really have to play with him.",
    "There we are.",
    "This is just a quick rush way to get it done.",
    "I'm definitely not a painter.",
    "In any way, shape or form I have no idea.",
    "How people?",
    "Paint.",
    "I have tried it.",
    "I want to keep learning how to try to do it.",
    "But My brain.",
    "My brain can't handle it, I just not yet.",
    "It takes practice.",
    "You know?",
    "Not so fun about this is there's so many things that you can practice to learn.",
    "And.",
    "I really get done.",
    "And things are messed up on just like that.",
    "It.",
    "Or brushes this one.",
    "This is Kyle's concept brushes.",
    "This one comes with photo shop.",
    "It just kind of just kind of.",
    "Like that it smooths everything out.",
    "And adds a little bit of texture to it.",
    "Just like that.",
    "Koala Turn down the opacity a little bit.",
    "Here we are.",
    "And then just for funsies.",
    "Um?",
    "Los Rios Bush.",
    "Has this really cute splatter brush?",
    "That is really good for freckles and I love giving all of my characters freckles.",
    "Just because you're an alien doesn't mean you can't have freckles.",
    "OK.",
    "I will fight anyone to the death who tries to tell me that aliens can't have freckles.",
    "Like you will not win.",
    "I have the high ground.",
    "Yeah.",
    "And freckles are anywhere everywhere.",
    "Mainly on the high points, the cheeks, the forehead, the shoulders, the nose, the chin.",
    "I'll look at that look.",
    "How cute that is.",
    "Well, it's a cute.",
    "This one is the one that I just uses leoch.",
    "At her splatter brush, start moving stuff around.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Uhm, I do want to grab that purple one more time.",
    "That's color burn.",
    "Where is that color?",
    "Burn.",
    "And I want to get.",
    "Stop being weird NIS.",
    "I just realized that my music stopped.",
    "I turned on the up Hey City.",
    "Yes, YouTube continue watching.",
    "You don't have to stop it.",
    "I hate that.",
    "Do you guys have that to where you're watching Netflix or YouTube or something and it's like videos pause?",
    "Are you still watching?",
    "It's on.",
    "Why do you have to check in on me?",
    "Let me do what I want.",
    "There we go.",
    "Can I just go in there and add that?",
    "Darkness.",
    "Come on.",
    "Well, I guess the touch on my pen is kind of being weird.",
    "Touch my pen is being very weird right now.",
    "Don't appreciate it.",
    "There we go.",
    "And then go down to that.",
    "Let's stop grabbing stuff.",
    "Goodness, I don't know what's going on with my pen here.",
    "Just smack it till it works again.",
    "There we go, smooth that out.",
    "And then.",
    "Nice.",
    "Not what I wanted.",
    "Move Lori.",
    "That's not.",
    "It's annoying.",
    "I think it's because this little pocket.",
    "OK, yeah, that's Why.",
    "I'm just going to do this.",
    "Because it's kind of making stuff a little weird.",
    "There we go.",
    "I just need it to be a little bit darker.",
    "So then that way we know that this is the deepest.",
    "This is the darkest area of the image, which is right there behind her neck.",
    "And then we can take.",
    "The concept and kind of smooth it out a little bit.",
    "Here we are.",
    "So the best looking good at something.",
    "Who?",
    "Tennis with my fingers to pop like that.",
    "Good Lord.",
    "Oh, right.",
    "Well, I'm actually really, really proud of that.",
    "She's looking good.",
    "I don't think there's anything else I want to.",
    "I'm really proud I can figure out her body markings later, 'cause I know that too good as they had the markings go all over their body.",
    "I can worry about that later.",
    "But I say that looks pretty good.",
    "Pardon me.",
    "Super Burpee.",
    "OK.",
    "Yeah so.",
    "Started out with this today.",
    "And then went back and refined it to this.",
    "Yeah, that's really good progress.",
    "So see I even traced my own stuff.",
    "'cause that's The thing is.",
    "No matter how hard you try, sometimes, like no matter how many times, do you draw a character, they're not always going to look exactly the same, you know.",
    "There's always going to be some differences, but I've really, really like that.",
    "I kind of like that teal a little more though, so I'm going to go.",
    "Do that really quick hang on.",
    "Just to take a look, just to see.",
    "Oh Well, that's a hard one.",
    "Because the face markings have to be the same color.",
    "Let's try.",
    "I think I'm just giving myself a conundrum.",
    "Woo.",
    "It's a little bit here we are.",
    "Oh yeah, I like that.",
    "I like this a lot more.",
    "I don't know if I like.",

    "'cause I mean when I when I started drawing her.",
    "Um?",
    "The first color palette I had for her.",
    "Was this?",
    "This is the first color palette that I had for her, which is completely different then.",
    "You know at grabbing things you know then what it is.",
    "Now you know.",
    "Ann OK.",
    "Just filters, I mean I do go through like.",

    "I mean, sometimes I do.",
    "Like how I said when I when I first came up with this color palette.",
    "Here I.",
    "I threw on.",
    "What did I do I had a couple colors that I put on top of this.",
    "And I just played around.",
    "An you know from this one color palette you know I through different colors over and play with the overlays.",
    "An like the color settings like multiply, overlay, color, burn, that kind of thing.",
    "That's how I came up with these.",
    "Um?",
    "So I.",
    "I think.",
    "Use them as your final touch, OK?",
    "I may not usually, uhm.",
    "I just kind of throw colors on and I see how it looks and hope it looks OK.",
    "No.",
    "But Why are you large?",
    "You're working out and I don't like it.",
    "I don't appreciate it.",
    "There we go.",

    "I think that's more for like.",
    "Editing photos you know, I think.",
    "I'm not exactly sure, I've never.",
    "I've never tried it, so I'm sure there's a way I could use it, you know?",
