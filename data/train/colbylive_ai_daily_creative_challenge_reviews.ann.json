    "Let me know if you have any work in here.",
    "Anything too well yeah, with the word cloud I think would be really cool if it did I had like this.",
    "Nice like softer texture to it.",
    "Could also be like a lighter color and maybe just have like these little rounder edges steps.",
    "I think that's really cool.",
    "You could also think about maybe making him almost like Isometric 3D.",
    "We can kind of see like going up them at an angle.",
    "That would be pretty cool.",
    "When it comes to Seattle, so I'm not crazy about how switches over, but I think it does work.",
    "I think there could be other solutions about like how to lay this out as well, but overall it's cool.",
    "It's really great idea concept.",
    "Justin Evans today three from Jane's improvement hopeful letter, can be read clearly this time.",
    "So here's one that designs were making, like AT shirt design.",
    "You really play with everything.",
    "So we actually open original on this side over here, so that way I can really get in there on the details, but really just tuned in and say hello, let me know if you can hear me alright.",
    "Everyone is going to see his design chicken chicken.",
    "That's exactly what this is, no.",
    "So it's a daily.",
    "Creative challenges is like what they normally do with Adobe live and I want to review some of the submissions that were going on this past week.",
    "Since this week, everyone's off.",
    "But also this looks really good when you actually get in on these details.",
    "You can start to see the different highlights are like a yellow, blue, red and green.",
    "A Jane.",
    "Oh cool, I was actually looking at your designed right now.",
    "Cool perfect.",
    "Yeah, I love how sorry so I have it zoomed in over here on my other monitor but I really love how you did the highlights of different colors.",
    "I think that looks great.",
    "It looks like the shadow like this purple part is a little off from that color and I imagine it's on purpose and it creates like this little like white edge that separates it.",
    "Nothing that's really cool.",
    "I do of the gradients on this one as well.",
    "How you actually go to like a lighter to a purple, you know, but it feels like there's a one gradient here and then it starts from like here is another one.",
    "It could be cool for, like maybe each letter was kind of like that, or if there's one from the other, but now these are looking good too.",
    "We keep throwing up here.",
    "So it looks like on the cover, which I really love this.",
    "This is the from the first daily challenge with Claudia from this past week.",
    "And is looking, yeah this is really quality texture that's on these.",
    "I think it shows up really nicely and light colors.",
    "The shadows are good really helps like feel like it's layered.",
    "I don't care what throws me off.",
    "A little bit is these shapes how they overlap both this one and this one because since you have the shadow on this layer, it makes me feel like there like higher up from each other.",
    "And so when this pink one are these ones like overlap that it kind of breaks that for me.",
    "You know 'cause I feel like.",
    "It loses some of that like layered feelings.",
    "Yeah no prob.",
    "Gen 2 let me know if there's any other work around here to they want to check out.",
    "'cause right now I'm really just trying to get caught up as well.",
    "And some of these design some really cool stuff, so this looks like it was from the previous challenges, which was like Hawks kitchen for Andrew Luck rental.",
    "And the whole thing was like a cooking theme which is really dope.",
    "So one of the days they had to make a menu and let's get in here and look at some of these details.",
    "Let me actually download this image of here on my other monitor just so I can really look at this one as well.",
    "Who is the 2nd?",
    "Maybe bring it up here if that works or not.",
    "Cool so yeah, we like the wood texture.",
    "I think the text gets a little close to the edges over here so it could be nice if you brother didn't have little more padding and like some breathing room.",
    "The typeface is cool but it's standing out to me that it's in like all caps.",
    "So then like the two words kind of start to blend together in a way like the space between the seat and the S is really big.",
    "See the process, but it's like just as big as the space between the SDK.",
    "Which makes me think that it's like Jane S kitchen, or at all, kind of like blends together as one word so it could be cool to play with the spacing.",
    "That.",
    "Or maybe it's like if it's mixed case, you know, like not all capitalized.",
    "So yeah, this is dollar sign right here is like a little bit larger than the other ones, so just make sure they're consistent.",
    "I would also.",
    "It's really what helps me.",
    "A lot is kind of like a grid system and lay like lines to help like make sure everything is aligned.",
    "You can see right?",
    "Actually I'm kind of blocking it from my head, the potato soup and steak and then spaghetti and coffee.",
    "It would be nice if all of those are kind of sitting on like the same line like across so it feels more like organizing that way.",
    "I think he started to do it right here, 'cause I see that dollar sign is like a little.",
    "Is a little bigger, so maybe make I don't.",
    "I could work to also make like all of the price is like a larger typeface or amino larger like size.",
    "Yeah, because I like how like the titles in larger and these are smaller 'cause it makes sense, but everything is going on.",
    "It's cool.",
    "The Popsicle sticks look good as well.",
    "I think this might be a little thicker.",
    "Maybe try just having one of 'em like duplicating the same one and then just changing the colors like textures and stuff like that.",
    "But like these images look like they're on the would they be could be scaled up a little bit just to give yourself more room to highlight what's on this menu.",
    "But also I can understand exactly how it's going to work.",
    "Like a flipbook, you know, cool.",
    "Kill me actually.",
    "Hide that window and go back to the discord.",
    "Everyone in the chat and as part of this let me know if you have any work they want me to check out too, so I'm just kind of going through this in the most recent ones so.",
    "Yes, we are very much appreciated.",
    "Keep busy with it.",
    "Nice so this is from the first one from the first daily challenge of this past week with Claudia.",
    "Um?",
    "Yeah, and I love how the Texans really come out when he starts showing these layers.",
    "It really starts to look like realistic like paper is stacked on top of each other, which is really dope.",
    "I love this color in the typeface you're using.",
    "I think it's like a lot of personality and works with the colored.",
    "It's also nice to see that's close to that thickness.",
    "Maybe these shapes could really be closer to reflect the typeface so it kind of feels little connected in that way, so that could be cool.",
    "But it is really cool.",
    "I'll just play with Photoshop blur effects in illustrator.",
    "World without chocolate is half.",
    "Nice.",
    "See I like I can kinda see like the edges.",
    "They feel like it's little layered from it.",
    "And yeah don't have just like one solid color you have like, some nice like splotches in there to help them feel realistic.",
    "These typefaces, your parents are really nice too.",
    "I like that chocolate is like a script.",
    "The typeface, while the other ones are like, varies like San Serif.",
    "I think they fit together very nicely.",
    "You probably don't need that underlying this blue chocolate, maybe even scale up the word chocolate, or do it like mixed case, where it's like the first sees capitalized in the breasts are like regular case.",
    "No, yeah, I think it's cool.",
    "It's looking good.",
    "I like the droplets are flying through the Sky right flying through this like movement going on with it so it's cool.",
    "Yeah, let's look at who's a Ortiz.",
    "So let me check this out on my secondary monitor and then bring it over in just a second.",
    "So here is a Guadalupe Ortiz will follow.",
    "Let's check this one out untapped society.",
    "So I think yeah, this typefaces work well together.",
    "Going with like the thin one in the very thick one.",
    "Uhm, nice on the colours and this texture that's in the background is very nice.",
    "It's kind of hard to maybe see it on the stream.",
    "Cool, so you're showing us like how the brain is actually used on the monitoring Salat Times up to homepage website is going to be like where a lot of train assets are actually used so illustrations are cool.",
    "The colors look really nice.",
    "I think the navigation like everything makes sense like a good website like the core elements appear.",
    "Login so OK so these aren't just the calories that's part of the actual load in said something to keep in mind.",
    "Just second, let me check something over here.",
    "Jasons gonna see you then.",
    "So yeah, I got printed chat.",
    "Snapchat me, uh so yeah I really like how you doing with get connected with resources and you really like using keywords and bold and I think that's a smart decision.",
    "It could be cool too if you really know how to do this.",
    "To actually animate this as well, to maybe show what the rest of that home page kind of looks like when you Scroll down.",
    "It would be really cool.",
    "No, yeah, you show the same text right here how you did it.",
    "Which I don't know if we need necessarily need this section right here to be honest, since you're really showing it right here, I think that's enough to just show like how it's working.",
    "A main color is nice.",
    "I like that you send the texture on top of Maine colors.",
    "Works well, additional colors so you have a lot of colors.",
    "So but OK, I see that you're actually using in the illustration styles.",
    "So nice, this also look like what's shown on the website, like right there at the bottom.",
    "So I'll see if you're showing these.",
    "I would show the same illustration too.",
    "I'll maybe show like another illustration or another way.",
    "We kind of using the brand.",
    "I think that would be really cool way to help highlight it.",
    "Now this is really cool mark.",
    "It's very interesting, so when you have very sharp angles like this, it makes me feel more like aggressive versus like.",
    "The handshake is very like peaceful and you can almost see like already like a heart kind of happening in the handshake.",
    "So I think there's a lot of contrast in going on here and it's the vibe is lending a helping hand.",
    "Maybe using one rounded shapes would help.",
    "Kind of like communicate that versus like you know the very hard like points.",
    "So this is cool.",
    "You're using the same like style, but you also, um, showing like how you do the same bold words.",
    "Now some more the website pages.",
    "Now like other laid over each other, if you really want to go, take a next level.",
    "You can think about breaking into ex.",
    "Dean Kamen making like an interactive version.",
    "Hum.",
    "Are you nice?",
    "I do like that one's in blue.",
    "I think that works well.",
    "It sounds good.",
    "Yeah, like that, you're changing the color of the like this type in here it really breaks up with different quotes inside everything.",
    "Let me just check the stream quality over here for just a second.",
    "Let me make sure everything's good.",
    "There we go, so Scroll down through there.",
    "I really like the purple one as well.",
    "Nice, I think it's really cool.",
    "Yeah, it's really like well built out like case.",
    "They do highlight this.",
    "I think this could be pushed further attention, like more ways using the illustrations and stuff.",
    "Yes, that's awesome.",
    "Let me go and bring that monitor over.",
    "Let's go back into discord.",
    "Let me know if the audio is too loud, you think just cranked up my ears a little bit.",
    "So teacher mark up last week challenge three is graphic design exercise.",
    "Cool see yes, let's click on this link.",
    "These details in here, right?",
    "So the typeface is really fun.",
    "I like the colors.",
    "It works well, feels very like bubbly, especially since at the very light like rainbow colors with these little highlights in the round edges thing that works very nice, but then the background too.",
    "With like this texture almost reminds me of like a fence or something.",
    "And then with the black and white like the grey feels almost like not aggressive in a way, but it does kind of contrast like the text so there could be another way to actually make like more of like a playful background.",
    "That kind of works with this type style.",
    "I think if you put a little further, yeah.",
    "So this cool image shown.",
    "Actually, you're saying it's from a shirt, like a Derby, so I'm guessing it's like Roller Derby, which makes sense if you do want like aggressive, you know at some point where it's like the pink, the netting style.",
    "Nothing that's cool.",
    "Yeah, I'd be really cool to see if this is for like dirty to show, kind of like some of the other assets they might use like some other ways.",
    "You can use it.",
    "Let's check out please Jesse Z.",
    "So I'm gonna open this up and actually get it back and look at the details.",
    "Just II is bringing this up here and less plus that up a little bit.",
    "Let me check something over here.",
    "She was still good quality wise.",
    "Cool so nice.",
    "I see Joey stop over there so I'm guessing it's probably like a logo mark that you got from there.",
    "Yeah no, this yes.",
    "He looks very nice.",
    "Yeah, look at all this for 2nd.",
    "See I wouldn't really love to be kind of further.",
    "It seems like it is like a lot of like stock assets can combine, and so I'd really love to see how you can use these stock assets and kind of like take it to the next level.",
    "You know this could start to pick the colors from these illustrations, but then yeah, I'd really love to see more of what you're trying to show, which now I'm guessing this one.",
    "The challenge was about building a case study and a lot of times if you don't have a lot of work yourself, you know it's good to kind of practice and follow along and show how you lay stuff out.",
    "So yeah, that's cool.",
    "Let me bring that monitor that window over for just a second.",
    "Let me check this over here.",
    "Nice.",
    "Still keep checking stuff out.",
    "Sweet, let me open this up over here.",
    "I remember seeing this one as it came in.",
    "So let's go command plus and let's just start zoom in in a bunch, look at the details so he actually just check out who was.",
    "Again, well, you know that's nice.",
    "Yeah, I remember seeing this one as it came in before.",
    "So yeah, this is really cool.",
    "Mark 'cause you're kind of like a yoga mind body soul, less like a yoga studio or like a yoga type brand.",
    "Or maybe yoga teacher.",
    "Pursuing the typefaces work well.",
    "You got the thicker one of top like these other ones down here and this how it actually starts to create.",
    "Like a person kind of doing yoga.",
    "I think that's really cool touch.",
    "And no, that's probably only yoga balls, maybe so I think it could be pushed over.",
    "There may be showing like.",
    "Yeah, I'm not sure how exactly do, but I think it's really cool idea, but maybe like the black filled circle.",
    "I think for the oh really stands out the meeting, so maybe there's another way to pull it off too.",
    "Yes, I think this really cool way to show kind of how do you use the typography and layout?",
    "The design?",
    "I think it looks nice, maybe see you have like this dinner one is doing in this in the thicker one maybe maybe you have like these like contrast.",
    "Little maybe 1 should be thicker, one should be thin or something.",
    "Nice, I think this choir show the business card.",
    "It's like with the leaf in the background makes a lot of sense.",
    "Things cool context for it.",
    "You got all these lines that we kind of pointing to it so it works very well.",
    "Plus this shape kind of sex are reflected leave.",
    "I think this business card that starts to look pixelated so I would go in and maybe like re link it if it was like a mock up or just like re dropping in on the right size or something.",
    "Please just music here for a second.",
    "Cool.",
    "This is why I love how you break up the images to show him like text in there.",
    "Actually, on the shirt, like when I see it like this, I can definitely imagine this as like a yoga brand.",
    "It works very well.",
    "Places like the green makes sense too, since, like growth and symbolize lot stuff like that, so let's bring that one over.",
    "Let's keep moving forward.",
    "Just check out some of these.",
    "So, working on last week's Challenge is just for fun, nice.",
    "So this one was for like playing with type and trying to make like word art through the Typography.",
    "So yeah, progress through actions.",
    "I think this looks good to start to show like OK so go in and it's like progress is like almost like like snapping back in like boom.",
    "I think there could be shown a little more and maybe progress isn't the best word for that too.",
    "Maybe it's like snapper like come?",
    "Hello, I think it's really cool concept.",
    "Yeah maybe they played with a little bit typefaces font to use.",
    "I think that's already like a trippy like wonky typeface.",
    "Progress through action, I would just make sure that through is like centered in the actual image too.",
    "And then this going around there I think works well.",
    "You start to lose some of legibility, but it works.",
    "Hum.",
    "Say for business card revise, drop shadow behind him so.",
    "Please OK.",
    "So at first glance I wonder if this text right here might be a little stretched.",
    "I'm not positive if it is.",
    "But it just seems like this might be like a little bit pixelated or something.",
    "I like the shape stories in the background, like this white with pink and dumb.",
    "Having ever looks really good.",
    "I think the black shape really stands out a lot of contrast along with the other colors, so maybe you'd like a lighter color like it makes sense to have your text like black or dark color to really stand out so you can see the info.",
    "But yeah, maybe that's something you could play with a little bit.",
    "Um?",
    "So that was Jane as well, yeah?",
    "Yes, I think really just these black shapes is what draws my attention in like a lot and it kind of like captures me immediately, whereas maybe you could bring it like another color that could work as well.",
    "And since you have this market already without the blank phone, like maybe even just show like how the home page of the website will look or something if you're going to like display it this way.",
    "It could be cool just taking next level or even just like the logo like act like it's loading screen or something.",
    "This is an AI file to skip down, just don't want to download their AI file.",
    "Yeah, ideally challenge day for from this past week.",
    "So business card.",
    "Let's check this one out.",
    "This is from Jose Ortiz.",
    "Thanks so yeah layout you like your text looks very professional.",
    "The way you have it, the name being like bold works well with the title blow it you got the icons.",
    "Social media right there.",
    "Yeah, I think this looks good.",
    "Hum, maybe that could be brought over.",
    "There could be something like that space that could be utilized.",
    "Like maybe this web pattern kind of gets brought over more and it's like very transparent towards like.",
    "Hard to see.",
    "But I think overall is really cool.",
    "I think this word mark right here is very interesting too, that I go and it's got like all the very big swirls going.",
    "I think it stands out loud because it's like reflective.",
    "So I wonder if it's going to be like foil pressed so it is I just make sure stuff like that just want to talk with your printer 1st and kind of know how they like to deal with stuff like that.",
    "But I think this was like you know.",
    "Yeah, for press would be really cool.",
    "Looks really classy.",
    "Yeah, no, it's awesome.",
    "I should be given all these like thumbs up to.",
    "So daily challenge 4 hour.",
    "Learning how to make complex shapes easy.",
    "Awesome.",
    "So I'm gonna open the original just to.",
    "Wish I can zoom in there so I think whenever this file got past him to have been like 72 DPI or something.",
    "So a lot of people didn't exported the right size.",
    "But yes, broken typeface.",
    "It's kind of hard to tell.",
    "Gonna look super blurry, but it's got these like serifs that kind of been down a little bit, which I think looks really cool and like these colors for like this reddish on this yellow.",
    "I think it works really well.",
    "Just like immediately points in there.",
    "Yeah, this is really cool.",
    "There's a lot of like action.",
    "It almost reminds me of like people get enough circus, but like karneval like those vintage like style like that.",
    "Especially with these lettering too.",
    "I can imagine like.",
    "Yeah, it written like that.",
    "Not super cool.",
    "Let me bring this back over here.",
    "Minimize that, we bring this over.",
    "Listen showed it like on the screen, right?",
    "There was a screenshot of.",
    "It's a lot of times people may not know how to export its data files to.",
    "Nothing is really cool.",
    "If this is for a logo to think about, like the text size is very small.",
    "So like this is by the smallest you'll ever be able to make it.",
    "You know it would be.",
    "Yeah, I'll just be very careful about like your text size.",
    "Does it make sure like your text is very clear and sometimes with logos too.",
    "Less is more, so if you can minimize the amount of calories I think it goes along way.",
    "Well, that's cool.",
    "No, Jane again, awesome.",
    "This is this one, so this is some like talking with tax.",
    "Basically where you had to kind of make the text into like the word.",
    "So yeah, love was the one that we all did together and like I think that came out really nice.",
    "You're applying also stuff.",
    "We learned a lesson before, which is like how to like layer.",
    "These are the shadows.",
    "I think it's dope textures.",
    "The really nice.",
    "It's cool how you actually have these shadows from the words like going on like this moon in the background.",
    "I think it works well just drop Shadow and I'm really highlights it with from this.",
    "Yes, that is really interesting.",
    "Looks like you're really playing with it and runs like shadow, like something like from a video game maybe, but like how you have the light actually hitting, this works really well.",
    "I'm like he tells like shining through right there.",
    "So yeah things though.",
    "She got this one.",
    "Let me open the original just so I can zoom in.",
    "You bring this over here.",
    "If it wasn't a chat, soon was submitted anything and wants to get any feedback to please let me know and I'll just bounce around.",
    "But your muscles work my way around through it let me.",
    "I'm taking a break for just a second.",
    "Let me double check the quality of stuff over here.",
    "I think a lot of other windows open.",
    "Do that for just a second.",
    "It looks like we're good, cool, uh, so for this one.",
    "Yes, there's a whole case study for last week challenges with I Claudius, that's awesome.",
    "Caesar cover one.",
    "Yeah, it's where you're playing like the layers like the shadows do.",
    "Those things looks nice see the glow effect around the bulb works well shapes like do not like framing natural text.",
    "So we've been amazed after second.",
    "So I think although the fact that she by continued somehow I feel like continuing on this image.",
    "I just have like softer edge or maybe into little before 'cause this was fine.",
    "Seems that corner, but since this like continues it would.",
    "It would be cool to see how these like flow from one to the other without like having like a breaking point.",
    "Especially.",
    "Especially, this is our on like one like a long ribbon now like it could be cool dad just really think about how this interact with each other.",
    "Yeah, talk with types nice.",
    "Yeah, we're brakes are literally breaking the word.",
    "You know it makes sense that you showing around like the dash line to just like highlight which word it is.",
    "I think it could help you with the word break, like it was split like kind of where it was like touched.",
    "You know like where the word letters would normally be in like.",
    "Those are like this.",
    "Spots that are kind of like broken.",
    "I think I can help them make sense.",
    "You know, if you have any questions about what I mean about anything to feel free to message me and I'll review like your personal work as well.",
    "Set T shirt slogan.",
    "Cool.",
    "Yes, so I do think that these goal posts the edges, so we're dealing with like T shirt designs.",
    "You want to make sure that like there's a certain safe space that can print in without like it getting warped are messed up, so you have to bring that in just a little bit.",
    "Also think about like where it's going to go on a person.",
    "That would be kind of low.",
    "Yeah, this business card yes OK I love how you doing these shapes.",
    "How is really like almost like paint and it starts breaking like these triangles.",
    "I think that's really cool.",
    "I would just be careful with that text on that because that's going to be tough to come out like printed.",
    "Very how these colors are interacting is really cool.",
    "How does even see like that push more unlike some of the other designs as well?",
    "The colour palette nice.",
    "I like how you sing it in Chiefs not just like circles like squares or something but actually showing like how it be.",
    "Yeah, it's really cool.",
    "Let's check out.",
    "Let's see who that was, again.",
    "Yeah, we know awesome.",
    "The designs that Jack and I reviewed yesterday in the portfolio reviews part.",
    "Um?",
    "Which let me double check with.",
    "This was again.",
    "Kris Kringle, Nice?",
    "We have just over this like his quickly 'cause we did.",
    "Chris is yesterday so yeah, I loved how the texture came out on this.",
    "It feels very rusted and how using like footprints delete across in those smart.",
    "This one was really cool.",
    "How you liking perspective?",
    "Nothing else really smart with like the popcorn like the blue and orange together work really well.",
    "Split is kind of like similar to what we were just looking at.",
    "Second you like break.",
    "I think you do a great job with that.",
    "One of the things we talked about was like maybe getting rid of the stroke from the inside where it looks like the word was like split from where it's you know like interacting.",
    "Yeah, with these ones we talked about this is like AT shirt design to think about too how thin you go with certain colors because it gets very tough to deal with printing when you have like very small shapes as well.",
    "But I think these are looking great.",
    "Yeah, and these are also two.",
    "We also talked about like how like the V right here that to me seems like a little tough.",
    "I don't know what the word was.",
    "It maybe it's kind of tough to understand what it was.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yeah, but don't really awesome stuff.",
    "Awesome, there's a teacher for black lives matter now 'cause you BLM?",
    "I think that works well.",
    "Yeah, that end is very wide too, so maybe even think about if there is possible to have mall like horizontal but we do want to vertical, you know just.",
    "It made me think about how these shapes can interact.",
    "Just do that.",
    "Em is a lot wider than the VNL.",
    "This looks really cool.",
    "Other taxes actually interacting with like the hair.",
    "I would maybe think about if you could bring it down to like less colors as well.",
    "Depending on the printing process you do.",
    "If you could get it to be just like you know where that like light blue light cyan color with like 1 orange then I think it would save you a lot of like even money just getting the printed.",
    "You could even get like this lighter color but maybe doing like halftones or like a different type of shading to use the same color but still get like a lighter shade of it.",
    "And then also about shirts two, we know some small ships Michael off, so just want to play it safe, but yeah.",
    "That's really cool.",
    "Well, that cover Chicago, Ella Watch.",
    "Please do this.",
    "Just second, let me get that to load.",
    "Cool, looks good, so let's bring this over.",
    "Yeah, Lindsay, Watch.",
    "Getting the metal like the submit texture looks really good blue.",
    "Yeah he started to see how these have the shadows and they really feel like layered.",
    "What throws me off is then it goes back to this one and it feels like this is like a lower than these.",
    "So maybe like this blue should be like the border of like this section.",
    "If not, maybe find a way to make this feel like raised above it.",
    "I think the text looks great, even think about like getting the dates to be able to order 'cause I don't think you need to add 2020 on both phones.",
    "I'm sorry, excuse me.",
    "Nice.",
    "How do you think?",
    "Maybe consider lightning the background a little bit?",
    "Maybe like adding with transparency to this black color so that we can kind of, or maybe even seeing how you can get like the texture to go on top of that as well.",
    "He said have a glorious, so I think that helps it stand out.",
    "But yeah, right here how you actually showing the texture through that.",
    "I love how that's interacting with excess.",
    "Feels like it's actually like on that wall and I wonder if you have this way to do that with this which you started to do.",
    "But then the glow effect I think, takes it away from that a little bit so.",
    "That's cool.",
    "Yeah, discovery, I think it looks really nice.",
    "I love.",
    "Yeah, this texture right here and this green how they interact with each other.",
    "It seems like a blend modes kind of illustrator daily challenge.",
    "Yeah, I'm usually not a fan of how like texting it.",
    "Kind of like slice in half and you have like effects changing, but I think this actually works pretty well and the layers of shapes like the waves almost.",
    "Like this, type space is very different than what you're doing here, which may be like contracts.",
    "Interface works, but then also on the other designs that might be part of the same challenge using different typefaces.",
    "So I would recommend maybe if you're going to do like a full set of challenges, maybe try to do them all with like the same type pairing and so that way it feels like a brand from each when you go to when you look back the whole week they all kind of feel connected in a way.",
    "But he's like another version of that as well.",
    "Yes, I think this is really quite like that.",
    "Colours reminds me of.",
    "Like an arcade or something.",
    "This is like magical.",
    "Especially with this typeface to how it has like these little extras on the edges.",
    "Please.",
    "Yes, it's good.",
    "About how close it is, the edges of the T shirt and also the sun right here, I think that's going to be tough to actually like print on a T-shirt.",
    "It's going to look like the type of printing that you're able to do.",
    "What is oranges?",
    "and I read this is like.",
    "Or maybe ranges, so yeah, even right there too.",
    "There's also, I don't know if it's supposed to read his oranges or ranges, so think about just wanted to be like as clear as possible.",
    "Yeah, see, someone said that.",
    "Let's you watch as.",
    "Please let me watch watch watch photography.",
    "I'm yeah, I'm curious to if you actually have the domain name, watch photography.",
    "That seems like a pretty solid one to have.",
    "Oh, let me mess with my green screen setting for a second.",
    "It looks like my T shirt over here is open out.",
    "Just a little bit.",
    "Yeah, just a second.",
    "Do this.",
    "No, actually I want this camera let me.",
    "Adjust the filter of it going to Chroma Key.",
    "Please bring up down just a little bit.",
    "They only switch seems right there, so you might have notice it, but hopefully it helps.",
    "I guess now it's a little more green around, like my hair and stuff, but I think that will help me to disappear.",
    "When is school?",
    "So yeah, this is we talked about you, so you're looking for watch it ography.",
    "I think watch with the script typeface speculative to read, especially you scale it down anymore than this.",
    "Uhm, I do have the shapes that you actually use in the background like this is hebra stripes and the how it blends in there.",
    "I think that looks really nice.",
    "Look very classy style to it.",
    "That I PCs are using the same types from the last image, which is awesome.",
    "But then yeah this down here is like a regular one, like amora body copy but then on.",
    "This is this is on you starting to use something like this out.",
    "Maybe use that other body copy that you're using.",
    "In this.",
    "Image on that, but for those dates on this one that should.",
    "I think the colors look nice.",
    "We go, we bring this over for a second.",
    "You going to check something?",
    "Go see let me bring discord back over.",
    "Let me go back to where was really fast.",
    "If it was turned into it has anything with him once he or.",
    "Or as many challenges will, while back wants to be reviewed, please just let me know your name Alvin like search it specifically.",
    "Yes, yes, so I think we're right here.",
    "Yeah, there's some buddies in, um, just face a lot too.",
    "So awesome, let me actually just double check it really fast.",
    "Yeah, looks good.",
    "Something bring this over.",
    "So coffee and Co branding also.",
    "This is like the show at the main cover image, such as logo on like the coffee beans background which I do love to actually see it like on a background image.",
    "I think that goes like really cool.",
    "I would say this text.",
    "This text is good but then once you start getting testy in 2020 in this text that goes around here that you really start to lose that when you're showing it.",
    "Like on that type of background.",
    "Even it might just even be like a little small.",
    "I would say if you can get rid of like two or three words and just have it to be like 3 or 4 words at most or something and scaling up a little bit.",
    "Similarly ST2020, yeah, that really gets lost in the edges.",
    "I think maybe scaling it up a little bit.",
    "Type this for the coffee and company.",
    "I think it works really well.",
    "It looks like also the STM 20s like underlying.",
    "You may not need that in the stars.",
    "Yeah, I'll just play with like how this part of it interacts with its little bit.",
    "I also think about how the text is right here.",
    "Maybe going into type on a path like flipping it because I feel like I want to see like it start from here and you read it over versus.",
    "It's something like there on the bottom part.",
    "Yeah, I like how you showed this to, so you'd like the main like word mark on the left side with actual compass spills over into coffee beans.",
    "I think it's really cool.",
    "Uh, maybe think about this text right here so allow people may have like visual Accessibility problems that may be typical difficult for them to see some colors on other colors, so I would go and give that maybe like an Accessibility test for like color impairment to see how that may look for people with different types of color blindness.",
    "Yeah, I think is really cool.",
    "I have this.",
    "Would be really cool, which would be kind of figure out how-to-do-it necessarily, but like having the top of this coffee shape kind of somehow make like your logo design so we could have that on their tours.",
    "Like somehow they can pour like the cream or however into to do that design.",
    "That would be really crazy.",
    "This is so you have business cards here.",
    "Yeah, like all these different versions of them as well.",
    "I think that works well.",
    "Ooh and yeah, this pattern that you made out of like that center logo design looks really good.",
    "Yeah, I really can't that's being used.",
    "Nice yeah.",
    "Yeah, just let me finish this one.",
    "I'll check yours out.",
    "Give me just a second.",
    "So yeah, so I'm just bringing yours up over on the other window for a second.",
    "Let me try to link one more time.",
    "We do right here in the surgeon it.",
    "I'm having trouble with that link you just share with Maine.",
    "I don't know.",
    "Yeah, let me try something else with fast.",
    "Yeah, sorry boss, just a moment.",
    "So yeah, that leak your posted wasn't let me actually go to that project and then also click on your profile.",
    "it is I don't see projects there so I would just suggest making sure that it's not saved as a draft and that it may be saved as like a published project on your portfolio.",
    "And then maybe the link will actually let me like connect to it.",
    "But no, yeah, thank you for sharing.",
    "Yeah, yeah there's like another linking submitted to let me know that wasn't working.",
    "A party checks.",
    "You've got a great balance between being enthusiasm and liking everyones work, but then giving solid feedback to make it better.",
    "Thank you.",
    "That means alot now, I really appreciate it.",
    "'cause sometimes, like when I lived in projects, I don't necessarily know what I'm going to.",
    "Yeah, you don't really know when to start looking at it and started trying to like rap your brain around how that system is going to work but no thank you very much.",
    "That means alot.",
    "That's really sweet.",
    "Hum.",
    "Yes, let's get down.",
    "So yeah, sorry left off the business cards.",
    "And yeah, the pattern was a really nice addition to it.",
    "Maybe it's kind of tough to tell, but it might be a stroke around different parts of this.",
    "Patterns, like right there, let me get back into zoom in a little bit.",
    "OK, hold on a second.",
    "Let Maine.",
    "Try way to zoom in even more.",
    "Yeah, so that one I think works well.",
    "Let me go over to where it's like over here.",
    "Who has a darker shade when I get close?",
    "I think it's fine.",
    "Um, there may be a lot of difficulty actually printing these cards.",
    "When I see that there's like very tiny shapes that might get lost.",
    "Things like printing process you do think about that as well.",
    "We zoom out a little bit and see how it looks from distance.",
    "Yeah, I think there may be like with this pattern.",
    "It may be a little tough with some of these shapes to actually get printed, so let's keep that in mind and think about like what the smallest size is that you can actually like print.",
    "That we'll need to go back to the whole project.",
    "I think it's cool like showing how it's.",
    "Show me how it's like island on white.",
    "Yeah, like that, you start to show like how people like almost like map out logos.",
    "But I think that could be maybe played with just a little bit.",
    "'cause I think if you're going to show it like mapped out like a grid or graft outweigh, I think you'd really want to push that far and like show how like all of its kind of mapped out something.",
    "If there is a good example of someone had that could think of that does that.",
    "I can show you what I mean.",
    "Yeah, I can think of doing it on my head.",
    "Sorry about it all the time where people actually shoulder logos and they show like how a grid or how it fits up with like like mathematically.",
    "So I like that you're doing that.",
    "I would just yet maybe recommend even push that further and logo symbolism nice so circles for the Cup of coffee from the top view, OK?",
    "Sorry, I didn't get that initially.",
    "I can see we're coming from without the circle works.",
    "I think if you're going to the circle, maybe actually have the handle that comes off of the sides and maybe that's where like EST or established there like 20 or something.",
    "Since like on the handle.",
    "Um plus leaves origin of coffee cool.",
    "So I'm not sure what the coffee leads actually look like.",
    "Whether it's like this or like that.",
    "But I was saying maybe if there is a way to kind of show like.",
    "That sheep like both times, you know like it helps with people more connected to these lips look different, and so it's like that leaf is supposed to symbolize that leaf.",
    "I don't know which one is like the accurate one.",
    "In the star blend of perfection.",
    "No, I love how you actually showing how it's like added.",
    "Like you're adding these up to make a logo.",
    "Mark that thing that really stands out to me is when you have like a mark.",
    "That means more than one thing because that's like a pet peeve of mine to someones has like.",
    "Don't wanna like talk bad about it?",
    "Let's try to think of something like if you do coffee now, I should say it.",
    "If you can do an organization, but the ocean and all you have is like you know, wave or something.",
    "You know it's like not as great, but if you can find another way to like.",
    "Combine multiple symbols.",
    "I think goes along way.",
    "Um?",
    "Yes, so packages.",
    "And yeah, you really showing this pattern again, which I think looks really good and it kind of looks very like professional so I can see.",
    "Yeah these all feel very connected and I love that actually showing like taking the next level showing these like mopped up.",
    "And like how this type actually works.",
    "Yeah, looks great.",
    "I would be curious to so if you have more than two flavors of coffee.",
    "If you're going to introduce other colors or if it's going to be multiple copies that are like this same color, you know whether it's just for bus to, or if it's like.",
    "Maybe there's like 3 flavors that are discounted freedom that color it may get difficult when you're in a store and it's like you may grab the wrong kind of coffee or something.",
    "So think about that.",
    "So you trying to stick with those two main calories, but maybe that limits you just two different flavors of coffee.",
    "If this is kind of the way you're going about like communicating it.",
    "This is been eseverri like classy as well.",
    "Yeah, this pattern works really well with the design.",
    "I think that helps a lot.",
    "Oh, and see it's my question, right?",
    "And so you're showing other colors.",
    "Cool, OK, uhm.",
    "It looks like these are planted with Adobe Dimension defined to guess.",
    "Feels like they're rendered 3D models.",
    "So yeah, when I started and that's the tough part with this too.",
    "When I start to see the package in these other colors, it feels very disconnected from these because all these are these two colors and I think that works really well.",
    "But then when I start to see these colors you start just feel yeah very different and then you start to run different problems where it's like it was like colored background in this text is a little tougher to show up.",
    "Same with that.",
    "Then we run the problem with the bottom logo.",
    "How you really can't see that text.",
    "And sending right here that legibility seem very tough with the store.",
    "Like besides, though, I think that looks nice.",
    "Yeah, I think these colours would be need to be played with a little more.",
    "I wonder if like you need to add in like other additional brand colors so you have like these two main colors, but then maybe have like you know pallet of like six other colors that work well with it that they just kind of uses secondary ones and he started do that here.",
    "But I think these colors feel very different than the other ones.",
    "I think the sides are in a great sorry and like the layout and how you just changing the colors make sense, but I think the colors here necessarily work to be honest.",
    "Yes, right here that text is very tough to read.",
    "Yeah, and then just the text in the bond movies last.",
    "I think you have too many renders of these as well.",
    "When you showing this, 'cause I can kind of imagine how these angles look since I've seen other ones.",
    "Yeah, I think maybe just like one image of each of these would be good to really show.",
    "Like, well rounded.",
    "Maybe pick like each color and have like like maybe one of 'em?",
    "Is this angle another one like this angle and you kinda like lead us through it so that way each image kind of shows something that's like interesting and new.",
    "Yeah, I like how you showing all them side by side.",
    "Yes, I do think they do not seem like this.",
    "I think it's too soon to feel connected.",
    "Maybe the colour should be a little better, but these two feel like the main ones.",
    "Yeah, I just think some of these colors, like the legibility, is in Super Strong.",
    "But I think the overall if they looked really good now that they're rendered 3D, I think that's really cool.",
    "Maybe you don't add additional flavors.",
    "Maybe it's just like, uhm, caffeinated in decaf or something to play save.",
    "But nothing else.",
    "It's like really like it's a very detailed project and I love that.",
    "Yeah, specially up here.",
    "I love how you actually laying down, laying out the entire brand.",
    "Getting down here, it turns into a lot of this, like repeating kind of similar vendors.",
    "So maybe just a little bit.",
    "Yeah, I think it's real.",
    "We minimize that out of the way.",
    "Tell Maine open this one over here and check it out.",
    "Sweet, let me bring this over.",
    "Minimize this, so yeah, so this from last week series of challenges with Claudius is super dope.",
    "So it looks like this little spot right there are maybe just make sure that's filled in is probably just something like when you look at it, but you just kind of misses details.",
    "Look at the green screen around my hand.",
    "It's kind of weird.",
    "I got this in the settings.",
    "Yeah, texture on this colors are really cool.",
    "In a little bit actually showing day one, you're laying out like very clearly OK this day one, did you?",
    "It's like we're doing all these things.",
    "OK, I see what's going on now so.",
    "Yeah, he's like two different versions of it as well, with a little bit of like inner like Shadow and hear the ones where it's like a really feel.",
    "So expect to be layered.",
    "It's also maybe takedown the shadows just a little bit, because I think this might be a little too thick when he starts to get inside the text it.",
    "That's kind of like, Oh, I see the shadows on the text.",
    "But it does really look like it is like stacked on top of each other, which is really cool.",
    "Thanks ily melting the word melt, supercool.",
    "I think the colors look nice.",
    "They're very like a light colors and it works well.",
    "So just try to get lined up perfectly.",
    "It's not like this like waviness, it's melting.",
    "Say something about you.",
    "It's like a blue red color and blue is usually representing a cool like a cold color.",
    "So maybe those melting.",
    "You'd want to show something like warm like hot like that.",
    "In balance, nice.",
    "Yeah, but that's like actually going right there.",
    "It feels very like it's like one way or the other.",
    "I'm curious about the oh right there.",
    "Yeah, I'm just curious.",
    "I don't understand that's why that was there specifically, so I'd be curious to see like what would you like.",
    "Was like the idea behind including that as well vegan.",
    "Nice so you're doing like inside the shape of the avocado.",
    "Super cool.",
    "Please I want to because usually avocado thing is like Brown color I think so maybe you want to have that be like the Brown color.",
    "Do you have just gone blank?",
    "But I think it's like the darker color so maybe yeah, word vegans should be like that darker color.",
    "This is from the two.",
    "Yeah, black lives matter is awesome.",
    "Yeah, I think the shadows on here like having this offset looks really good.",
    "Yeah, like I think the you could jump with the lighting I would say think about you where the actual highlights kind of our 'cause some of them are like this left side with somebody on the right side and these other ones don't have it so I would just make sure whatever you're doing that it's like feels like it's coming from like the same angle.",
    "I think this is really good.",
    "I love how it's like super like monkey edges.",
    "Yeah, like the colours looks really dope and how you actually put it on like a statue other than super fun cool.",
    "Bring this over here on the exit out of that.",
    "Let me double check something over here in the sun.",
    "Fisher is still good to stream quality and if it was just turned in they smell anything.",
    "Please let me know and I'll be sure to check it out.",
    "So check out some of the actual business card designs from challenge 4th.",
    "This is the shapes are looking really great how it's actually like leading you to the M&AZI think it's super cool and this typeface to this in is really sweet.",
    "How like loops around and does that with a ZI?",
    "Think that Z fits really nicely like in the corner of that M so that works really well.",
    "Mega Zoom Creative Company cool.",
    "Setting is nice of the credit company starts like behind that.",
    "G maybe could be brought up a little bit.",
    "I really do like this magazine with typeface.",
    "They're using their.",
    "And then.",
    "It looks like creative company is a different typeface in this body copy one that just started.",
    "Feel like maybe there's too many that are happening on this.",
    "I get this is part of like a logo and this is part of the actual body copy, but maybe there's a way to play with that and open feel like a little more connected as well.",
    "And I would actually make up like a street name and stuff too.",
    "So it feels like more real.",
    "Because you may end up with like a much longer address in that or something.",
    "The end of the shapes, the background create like really cool like effect it's going on.",
    "Yeah also.",
    "But I'll watch again.",
    "Let's check this out, let me.",
    "Download it maybe.",
    "She's not giving option downloaded this odd.",
    "Did you see those preview?",
    "Let's see if I can bring it up in just a second.",
    "OK, here we go.",
    "We should be opening it.",
    "And then let me see if I can zoom in on some of these details.",
    "Honestly though, so yeah, I would make sure you're like a high quality.",
    "I think we did look at this kind of in like your Behance page as well so I think it's the same projects but I do like how you started out.",
    "Nicely.",
    "Really open original.",
    "Going to do this.",
    "Your boom, let's check this out.",
    "So I'll just make sure that you don't stretch images, so that's something you want to be really careful about, like how it's just pixelated so that way when you export it like you don't end up like any mistakes, this feels stretched.",
    "I think it's a little like 2 tall.",
    "Let me bring this monitor down for a second.",
    "He also make sure the quality is still good.",
    "If somebody's are very Kristen, so these aren't, you know so that makes me know that it's like not the entire ribbon.",
    "It's like individual pieces of that.",
    "I think we call is really cool and he started actually like think about hiring to do text in here.",
    "We just make sure we're showing two.",
    "Feels very cohesive but I understand you how we're trying to just learn how to build like a case study.",
    "You know cool yeah, thanks for sharing.",
    "Talk with type from last week with Claudia.",
    "So honestly yeah this will talk to type exercise like one of my favourites.",
    "I love to actually see how I come across these all the time on Pinterest about how people like interact with words to make new things.",
    "I think is really strong here with free and how it's behind bars.",
    "This is like not free, which is like sad.",
    "Shadows behind that also looks good, so it helps if you little like more layered.",
    "Hum.",
    "Tell me how I can.",
    "Yeah, I'd even tried flipping the colours.",
    "Maybe the word free is like in white.",
    "That or actually maybe it's supposed to be black.",
    "I don't know, yeah.",
    "Yeah, I don't know.",
    "Maybe you try flipping the colours or try.",
    "Yeah, maybe a texture is well on the white.",
    "Could be really cool to actually show.",
    "Maybe it's like metal.",
    "But I think this is really cool, is very good.",
    "Like this strong messages also.",
    "It is nearly also, uh, let's check out your menu design too from Hawks kitchen from the DCS from the previous DC challenge.",
    "Nice, so I think this typeface for the sandwich shop works and it looks good for that.",
    "I think when he starts to use it on a lot of these things it gets very busy because when you have like all these items that are stacked right here for some reason when I look at it feels like the text is kind of like wobbling or it's like not starting to my place or I don't know.",
    "It's just that script typeface doesn't line up as well as like some of these other ones do, and especially with stuff like this he wants to be very clear that something like looking really fast for like Oh it's like $0.75 for red onions or something.",
    "You want to be like.",
    "No, that that's there, you know.",
    "So I would maybe suggest even using like a Boulder version to like this typeface, or like maybe like something like cool some of this for some of those titles and then maybe like a typeface that using for the sandwich shop use effort desserts and like your choice and like kind of like keywords like that.",
    "They want to get their attention for.",
    "Well, I think the Flowers are really cool.",
    "Another day at these stripes and I think it's really great that he kind of like fade behind like this white cloud.",
    "So that way they like it, makes the text like really clear.",
    "Cool.",
    "Emacs awesome, see, this was from the day one of the last challenge is cloudy.",
    "Yeah, I think the shadows look good and really helps it feel like layered.",
    "I think what throws me off to set the texture all lines up and you can see like the green go from here to there so that just kind of like my brain makes me know it's like OK this isn't like really stacked so I wonder if there's a way to kind of like play with the textures on like each layer being kind of like different.",
    "I think the colors look good.",
    "Yeah, it's awesome.",
    "Play over the originals.",
    "Been kind of zoom in there for a second.",
    "Sweet, so you probably working like the art board that we already had.",
    "Just make sure it's kind of like scale to where it should be.",
    "Let me actually minimize that for a second.",
    "So.",
    "OK, I see you kind of using that up here for each different thing and if you can say like Day One challenge is something like challenge one, which I yeah, I think if you do it you may not need it like as big maybe have this like a smaller element to preach divide but make sure that you kind of fill up the entire artboard and then it's also like lined up from these edges.",
    "I think that's something like small town keeps with attention.",
    "But they want something that looks really good now.",
    "Even the recommend.",
    "Yeah, pushing it further and trying to use like texture on it.",
    "Setting whenever I see them with texture it really just brings it to the next level.",
    "But then you also like this little shape right?",
    "Actually my heads blocking it like right there.",
    "I can't like right there.",
    "Yeah, maybe just get rid of that.",
    "Exciting, that's just like maybe like I like something like just forgot about like a hidden part.",
    "The color is being broken down.",
    "I think that works well.",
    "We may not necessarily need the colors, but if you do I would make sure that they're all like aligned on top as well.",
    "So if you just go into the align tools like in illustrator, there's abundant kind of click into just kind of does it for you which is the.",
    "So yeah, just make sure these are lined up.",
    "Um?",
    "Yes, this summer.",
    "I think you did a great job with this word.",
    "Martin were trying to like talk with text because usually like the red in the middle makes it feel like super hot like him like he did like it is summer and then the lighter edges too.",
    "So it's like in the middle is like burnt, you know, but it's that kind of fading out.",
    "Yeah I think that works really well in the blue background to it does remind me of like summer.",
    "I can see that like a beach T shirt like down here in Florida.",
    "And T shirt designs being you know, the next one cool.",
    "see I have it right here.",
    "Cool, so yet is it curly idea?",
    "I think it is well, I would just make sure it's centered in a T shirt then also go in and maybe scale it down a little bit 'cause when you print on T-shirts there's only so far you can go then.",
    "Also keep in mind when you use like the gradient like this, sometimes you're going to be limited in like what kind of printing processes you can do.",
    "But I think it's really cool to have this as a T shirt.",
    "I think that would even you people would like Taurus would buy this like it works.",
    "The business card?",
    "Yeah, just double check.",
    "The spelling is an eye right there.",
    "Also this ones in all caps.",
    "This ones lower case so just make sure what you're doing is I consistently.",
    "So cool, yeah, I think the shape you're using down here super fun out maybe say make like 2 like two or three more of those and then make him like 5060% transparent and kind of like flip open.",
    "Use them in different spots on this business card and maybe show me what the other side will look like as well.",
    "That sexy body scale little bit V qv T is like the main like logo out maybe yet how did it fit?",
    "Like up in there so it's super clear and then think about how this text aligns with each other.",
    "So think about the hierarchy of what is most important 'cause for me I would imagine it would be like your name and then you title and then maybe like how to reach you.",
    "So maybe think about like the name should be big and like the job title below it.",
    "Oh my green screen is kind of like if I go move certain places my green screen starts to Crackle Or.",
    "Yeah, then also think about like your email address on here too.",
    "You gotta make sure it's not overlapping the shape.",
    "If they're both like the same like white.",
    "If you make this maybe like you mess with the Opacity and make it kind of transparent then I think it would be OK to kind of overlap when you have it like this starts to get a little tough.",
    "The business card too if you want to add like your hometown or of portfolio like website or a phone number or something too so that way they can actually like or social media like something else.",
    "We can not only know how to reach you but also know how to like.",
    "See some of your work as well.",
    "So like they can know if they want to reach you.",
    "That makes sense.",
    "So cool?",
    "Yeah yeah.",
    "Big thing though.",
    "Just stains out your ideas.",
    "Make sure they're all like lined up like perfectly aligned if you brought up Mike into illustrator and use the line tool it will just kind of do all that for you for the most part.",
    "Yeah, but awesome things down Tina.",
    "Minimize that.",
    "Played with type records, jeans awesome.",
    "Let me open the original.",
    "Bring that over here.",
    "Let me kind of just zooming out maybe.",
    "We want to be working now.",
    "Let me try it again.",
    "Cool.",
    "Yeah, so this challenge you know the goal was kind of.",
    "Take a word and then kind of turn it into like trying to turn the world into like that word anyway so like talking with text talking with type.",
    "This is one of those book called so pressure.",
    "I think it's really cool.",
    "I think they start to feel like two different words though so I may be like somehow have like one of these S is kind of like fade or feel like the essays are squished into each other.",
    "So that way there's like pressure kind of built up with something with my hands, but that's how I cannot communicate like it.",
    "Like squeezed, I think that's great where you have like the inside the text kind of bending in.",
    "It's like literally squeezing it.",
    "Maybe even have the tops of these like start to like swell out a little bit towards like exaggerating it.",
    "Because when I sort of think of these I try to think about like OK how would this be animated in like how is this doing afterwards and one of the key like principles of animation is like exaggeration like kind of overdoing the movement to really show it.",
    "Like relax, I think there's some.",
    "It's like really exaggerated into.",
    "I think the colours throw me off a little bit.",
    "I start to think about a Google like logo for some reason just like oh.",
    "It's just like the colours something but.",
    "Yeah, the waviness of relax I think is a good idea, but I think it's maybe 2 intensive waves for me to feel relaxed and roll how it's rolled up.",
    "I think that works well.",
    "Would be cool if you had another word like over here like rolled up or like.",
    "Ed or something that's like rolled.",
    "Don't know?",
    "Yeah, I think yeah, this is my space over here that can be played with.",
    "Or maybe it's just repeating like roll on the inside and roll over here and you just sound like parts of the word.",
    "Yeah, that's really quality.",
    "Seem like talking text is like my favorite ones I think.",
    "So Johnny Quest.",
    "Next we're checking out some of this work.",
    "Yesterday.",
    "Here the cards with suggested changes cool.",
    "So let's look at this cover 'cause I really like this mark that you're using.",
    "Nice yet is very like he's like futuristic style, which I think is really cool and this color works well.",
    "The contrast in the background.",
    "I'm curious if the space over here is the same as the space over here.",
    "I'll maybe make sure it's aligned.",
    "I guess it's lined up with this.",
    "So maybe that's where you want to look at it.",
    "Yeah, I guess it is.",
    "Maybe it's just like me looking at it for plants.",
    "Yeah, that's super cool marks.",
    "Very interesting.",
    "I'd be curious what this like you know represents maybe like doves, peace on Earth or a death star.",
    "So our King Saul Designer paints on it and also URL.",
    "Other ships are cool.",
    "I think they may be like a little too intense that they don't feel like they were on purpose and maybe like feels like somethings like accidents happening so I may be trying to find a way to like put these shapes a little more.",
    "Yeah, and I think the black text, I think it might be better for his white text too, so really contrast with the background and that way like this QR code.",
    "Yeah, I think that way.",
    "I think we really want this to be white 'cause I think the first thing you want to see is like your name.",
    "So that's like we should draw attention to most.",
    "But right now, like these colors are super bright compared to that.",
    "It would be hands to a little trick I learned is instead of having to spell out all of the hands you can do b.net dash rat mini just so we can kind of short URL as well.",
    "So challenge three also.",
    "Let's check this out Purdue.",
    "So let's look at some of the challenges or something submissions.",
    "So fake it so fake it until.",
    "Until you make it OK, take it until you make it OK.",
    "So yeah, that was coming to figure out like like understand the quote, which is how is able to figure it out.",
    "But just be think about 2 how people usually reach you see start which you have right like the top left which like fake and then you know maybe you go like left to right you kind of go away like down.",
    "At least that's how we do it here in America.",
    "And so yeah, when you're using like words more than once and it showing it through scale.",
    "I got that because I know the quote but I think that would be really hard to communicate without that.",
    "And like so, maybe you do need like a fake it until you make it like I think you might need this actually like words in there just to really like communicating clearly.",
    "Nicole is really nice though.",
    "Challenge for.",
    "So let me open that one up to you because that was kind of small.",
    "We bring it up here so SB designs quadrant typefaces work.",
    "Yeah, like they aren't actually borders around there.",
    "Maybe this is like the trim work, maybe that's part of the design.",
    "I think that's good.",
    "Sweet.",
    "Going to challenge one.",
    "The adventures.",
    "So one thing I want to say to his double check your spelling so I know on here you also have challenge, spell wrong, adventurous and I know a lot of times you know English may not bills first languages and stuff, but just whenever we're going to design you want like just double check just sending a lot of times like when you're doing it in illustrator.",
    "It's not going to automatically tell you it's spelled wrong, you know.",
    "So I think this is really cool colors happening with the Brown in the green and instead had like this pool like like a swimming pool like type texture over top of it, which I think is really cool.",
    "It throws me off.",
    "Is the red and like the white dots in the background it feels very different than everything else.",
    "Maybe it's like a picnic blanket or it's like a close up of like a strawberry or something but it does start to feel very different from these, especially since these have like that pool like that swimming pool type like texture on top of this.",
    "And also another one so be shapeless and formless, like water.",
    "Cool.",
    "So see if you're trying to show it's like water.",
    "Maybe send you some Blues and maybe like help.",
    "The quote kind of feel like it's like water as I like these rounded edges and it feels very organic or maybe even show it with like.",
    "This texture using here which is like that pool filter maybe even just like.",
    "Maybe just show like that on top of.",
    "This just kind of like help get like another element to it and maybe think about two quotation marks.",
    "If it is like a quote.",
    "Maybe you could also bring like shapeless beside B and then an formless.",
    "So it's like the shapeless and formless like water and it kind of fits more like a better like block.",
    "Yeah, the Super cool stuff.",
    "We give this and thumbs up when I got a second.",
    "So Monday cool.",
    "Let me open the original come on really zoom in like that mark route working with.",
    "So this is from one of the challenges is this past week as well.",
    "Let's bring that over cool.",
    "So yeah, I think you did great, but the highlights all being like insist on the same edges and the colours.",
    "I think that works well.",
    "I would think about you, the direction that the offset like shadows going.",
    "So if the highlight is hiding from this angle, it makes me think that the sun is somewhere like where the light is somewhere over here.",
    "And so maybe the shadows should be on like this side of it.",
    "And then out of think about you, what you're trying to communicate through like Monday, whether it's like Garfield and it's like Oh Mondays are terrible.",
    "Or it's like it's Monday.",
    "I'll just think about what you're trying to communicate through Monday, just so that way you can try to like put some that symbolism in through that Typography as well.",
    "So let's scroll up, see which other ones we can find.",
    "Cool, so this is by a Stella.",
    "Is it also an active member as well?",
    "So it's really cool?",
    "Yeah, I think this design works well and you have all these lines are like pointing us towards that S and it looks like there's a little bit of orange behind that she was like still little addition.",
    "Then yeah, you really started bringing that orangish yellow like behind there.",
    "It, even as I may be right out your full name as well too, so they know like how do we dress you, whether it's like right?",
    "Like Stella and maybe your last name or test.",
    "Or yeah, I think it's always good to include your full name or like the title, the business or something rather than just the S.",
    "So design is passion place.",
    "Yes, I really liked the typeface you're using for this out.",
    "Maybe think about maybe not capitalizing the eye for is.",
    "I think maybe that would be lower case and that would also give it give you the ability to bring these like a little closer together.",
    "So let me minimize some regional left side.",
    "I think the colours like having this like lighter like muted yellow, the background, it works really well because this is such like a vibrant yellow.",
    "Yeah, that is good.",
    "I would think about you like we see right here.",
    "How like this Mexican mouse.",
    "Unlike the ion passion, how the black sheep goes a little bit to the left of it, but it doesn't do it on this one, so I'll just make sure that they are consistent in little things like that, and especially if you bring this one lower case.",
    "Make sure like all of these have like consistent space like that around it.",
    "Then awesome on the teacher.",
    "So yeah, I think this may be a little low.",
    "'cause yeah I think that would be like I think maybe like a little low on the T shirt.",
    "Someone you want to hire and then this is cool down here too.",
    "I think about like where that is where you want it.",
    "I don't know if people put up with the colours or we built in front of the shirt.",
    "They have a small here and thing on the back so I'll just think about like how it's going to look on a person and also maybe make sure that is like exactly centered as well.",
    "Let's do this one so it from space mom nice.",
    "So let's look at the backside for.",
    "So yeah, the cover is just like these chips around here.",
    "I'll put it in case I think looks great that K&S, like I love how it's like.",
    "I'm gonna open up to 7 C.",
    "Hum.",
    "Like I was like pointed right there, that feels like very fancy thing that works well.",
    "And then I like how this is very like solid shape that you're using around that because that purple like Starship coverage retention in the KS is what like is the main thing communicates.",
    "That's like dope.",
    "Let me exit out that let's.",
    "Check out the other side of that.",
    "Let me bring it up a little bigger schools starflower photography also, so I think the letting which is like the space between those two words right here could be like brought down a little bit.",
    "I think they'd be a little closer together.",
    "I would also yeah, maybe play with this style of these.",
    "Maybe these down here should be like a thinner typeface and then keep this one like a little bolder.",
    "I do love that this is like latter.",
    "It's darker and so it's a lot of high contrast between those backgrounds, which I think helps a lot.",
    "Let me double check something over here.",
    "It looks like my stream quality may not be that good right now.",
    "Baby girl They were OK.",
    "Yeah, let me know the stream quality goes down.",
    "It's just I think because it's my preview device.",
    "Which is still not showing the chat right there for a moment.",
    "Give me just a second to kind of fix that.",
    "Yeah, I think we're good black Becky saying, can you review my work?",
    "Yeah, definitely, UM yeah, I think you're active.",
    "Using discord.",
    "Let me see if I can just search yours.",
    "I I'm going to guess this is you because the same profile picture of the same name.",
    "So let me know if there's a specific project or if I'm like you know, looking like older stuff or something.",
    "Yeah, let's check this one out.",
    "Yeah, these two new by picking, that's awesome.",
    "Let me actually check out what this was, so maybe you're asking a question about this one.",
    "Let me check this out, it only this one.",
    "Which I think is treehouse looks insane like this is really impressive.",
    "Yeah, the edges of the trees look really good and you really doing great job with the lighting and showing depth this thing, no?",
    "No, no that.",
    "No that one.",
    "Well, we do this.",
    "How do your portfolio directions?",
    "Yeah, let's do this one right here.",
    "So that looks like when they will share challenges.",
    "Yeah, sorry.",
    "I'm just kind of like going blindly from like the side over here.",
    "But let me yeah, let me click away from now for a second.",
    "Let me make sure this is all the way up.",
    "And we can see in a little bit, so might as well can you review it on the beginner?",
    "Yeah, totally let me.",
    "Yeah we do surface phone.",
    "Which it looks like you like.",
    "This one is definitely do it again.",
    "Follow you so day.",
    "One cover art.",
    "So super cool typeface using here.",
    "It's very like blocky, which I always like.",
    "This ones that are like super like big blocky.",
    "It feels very like vintage or like I'm not vintage.",
    "It feels very like come.",
    "Ancient, you know?",
    "So my challenge.",
    "So when I see this like how like fuzzy and roughly edges are, it makes me think that it's like pixelated, not like rough and up.",
    "So I would maybe bring that back a little bit, not do it like as intense.",
    "Yeah, maybe even like.",
    "See if you can play with a little bit of like shadow on it or something.",
    "Just that I don't help him feel more like it's like grounded in there.",
    "Or if there's something you can have like that texture kind of showed through, like on top of that text.",
    "I think that would really help.",
    "So did you talk with type, place?",
    "These type of transform tools to modify words?",
    "So yeah, double check like space, right in front illustration, meaning without using images.",
    "Yeah, I'm really.",
    "So yeah, yeah bubbles until you end up doing it from the other way.",
    "We're talking about two, which I still don't know if that's the right way to do it like it makes sense to me.",
    "Like you read from left to right, but then you do things like, oh, maybe it's descending, but it's like they're starting to ascend from this side.",
    "So it was something that was is tough to figure out what the best answer is that 'cause I don't know, but I think that it looks really nice and I think the bubbles like the edges look really good.",
    "How it's like a darker blue and it's getting really late in the middle.",
    "Yeah, little bit.",
    "Graffiti this looks great.",
    "Yet here I did the.",
    "I think this is the version two that has like the graffiti like letters like staggered where you had two that you're kind of deciding between.",
    "But I think this looks great and all of its different colors.",
    "It's very like playful and feels very like kid friendly.",
    "And then look videos.",
    "It's got the little line between that kind of like glasses and peoples eyelashes.",
    "Yeah, that's awesome.",
    "Yeah, maybe even say like maybe it's a different typeface to work better for this.",
    "Museum with these ones of these points to like.",
    "Yeah, I don't know.",
    "Maybe different.",
    "I think there's a lot of interfaces that can work for this, 'cause it's like a very like you know, like thought out idea is very clear what it is, so I would experiment with these other ones I could work.",
    "Day three T-shirt slogan Designable Typographic T shirt slogan.",
    "So I do like how you're breaking up all these sections and how it's like very clear what days what and how you actually describe it to for people who weren't a part of that saying you remember, well yeah no, definitely yeah lot of 'em do stand out to me so that's also.",
    "But now it's called an especially cool seeing, often lined up here like together too, so I can see, like like I forget to someone's at the bubbles and the graffiti, or both you so it's cool to see all of 'em in like like Oh wow, you multiple good ideas come together so it's awesome.",
    "Yeah, so yeah W doing for these titles.",
    "Time is money and money is what we're here for cool.",
    "So yeah, I like that this lighter like that.",
    "I wonder like that black really stands out to me too.",
    "I wonder if it worked well if it was like a lighter color too.",
    "I think the is looks cool.",
    "I like that it almost feels like someone took a Sharpie to the T shirt and was like I'm right like someone like Witten finish the quote, you know?",
    "I think this these are these are lower case.",
    "These are all caps.",
    "Maybe just do one or the other.",
    "I kind of like that is lower case.",
    "Maybe think about having this lower case or if it doesn't look good.",
    "Maybe think about having this caps or maybe leave out.",
    "Is that something I would just think about playing with?",
    "And maybe I like that is just starting over at the Y.",
    "Maybe you could also make it a little bigger like rotate it and you can feel like it's like placed on top of that.",
    "Like these cars like this like lighter, grayish, brownish, greenish.",
    "Whatever that color is mixed on top of this light green.",
    "I think it looks really good.",
    "The Black is that almost like 2 like much.",
    "I think this is car design.",
    "A business card using lines and symbols to create a striking optical effect!",
    "Cool.",
    "So yeah, throws me off their space here in here.",
    "I'll maybe show.",
    "This business card like left and right side and this one below here like separately.",
    "Maybe just as I get right here and I'm like Oh is there image that hasn't loaded yet.",
    "OK, so it's all one long ribbon too, which makes sense how it's laid out like that.",
    "Yeah, the real estate house.",
    "I love that there's all these lines leaving in there all kind of pointing towards the text and that you actually make a house out of like the negative space.",
    "I think that's a very clever.",
    "The real estate house you have.",
    "It's about.",
    "The second zoom in.",
    "Cool.",
    "Uh, so I think that works.",
    "I would just.",
    "To real estate the house, I think that works.",
    "I'm not crazy about the light kind of shining through the text of balance.",
    "We need this text.",
    "I would just make sure with this you have a little bit extra space on the sides.",
    "It looks like the www.com you have a little space bound say give it a little more than that.",
    "Maybe like double that and then do the same over here and make sure it's like consistent and then seeing the phone number.",
    "Maybe think about adding parentheses or like little dashes between.",
    "It's just that way like people when you see a lot of numbers together, it seems it's harder to just immediately type in the number, but if you break it up into intervals like 334 then it's like can be a lot easier if you will just see it and understand it quickly.",
    "Meeting It's awesome so yeah.",
    "And also yeah you business cards right here.",
    "Look great.",
    "I love the purple and green colors using here.",
    "This make it a little too dark.",
    "Especially start to run into people with like different visual impairments.",
    "And like maybe he's trouble with like color vaccine color.",
    "So I'll just make sure it's super clear.",
    "I love how you're using that here and it used a little bit of a texture.",
    "On top of that.",
    "Yeah, I think is awesome graphic designer.",
    "Any of your portfolio.",
    "It's very clear like your name.",
    "Yeah, I think that's right.",
    "The second zoom out back to normal.",
    "Yeah, that's also let me exit out that.",
    "Let's see, there's one more you haven't hear about setting the full case study for his math one yet.",
    "Let me type in a Monica or Monica.",
    "And let me know two this is you 'cause different picture.",
    "Yeah, Monica, let me know if this is your project as well, like videos, usually delayed by minute, so it may take a second.",
    "Yeah, this from the last challenges, and if not, we're going to check it out anyways.",
    "Get sweet so yeah and this one.",
    "You actually have the same picture.",
    "It looks like he's taking the 2nd to load.",
    "Yeah, just give this a second.",
    "Sweet.",
    "Yes, it is from the last series.",
    "Can you review my kitchen?",
    "Yeah, definitely let me do that.",
    "Yeah, I did after these steam and he had no problem.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Yeah anytime.",
    "Uh.",
    "Cool.",
    "So it looks like when you upload this to you maybe give it a little bit of padding on the edges, or it may not be big enough to fit in there.",
    "I would just say since it is a long ribbon, maybe just trying to bring all the edges just so I can really see.",
    "Like all this text, these those any small I won't be able to read it, but right there I can.",
    "Well, I'm not posting this important.",
    "Yeah no region?",
    "Yeah no check out the kitchen wonder because the kitchen theme was Superfund anyways, do.",
    "Design eye catching cover art for your Venus project using the layered paper effect, achieve a realistic look using the pen tool texturing Mass in the appearance panel.",
    "Cool if they actually laid out the colors that used to make it as clear as possible.",
    "It's like OK, this is the colour palette.",
    "Then you start to actually use them for all these going forward, which is really cool.",
    "Yes, I think you do good job with the shadows like the layers and the tax share.",
    "It does feel very realistic and feels very layered.",
    "Legacy must stream does not load.",
    "Let me know if anyone else is having the same issues.",
    "It could be a connection.",
    "OK now I'm back cool.",
    "OK, that was mixed with some like Oh no.",
    "Maybe the video cut out or something but cool yeah so.",
    "Yeah, I really liked the colours using here.",
    "I would maybe think about the shapes like this shape feels with a sharp angle and then it goes these rounded ones.",
    "It feels very like different.",
    "You know 'cause these ones, how they're very like Triangle Circle, you know line.",
    "It's like this main shapes, which is cool but this one it starts to feel like a some type of blob thing.",
    "So maybe bring up different shapes or maybe think about maybe using shapes to actually like have some symbolism or something like a a challenge like.",
    "Hum.",
    "Even just the circles are just like maybe just making clouds reshapes.",
    "I think would be really cool too.",
    "'cause it makes it start to feel like less like you just showing they can do shapes and more that you're showing like you're trying to communicate something through the cover.",
    "Hey, I look on there too.",
    "That still works and also.",
    "As a man, I haven't been under the maiden.",
    "You like illustrator logo, so you could also look for that one online too.",
    "I don't know if it's easily accessible.",
    "So they do so awesome.",
    "So I would say to you, don't let the case study get in the way of the artwork because right now when, let's say we divide this in half, you know we're seeing like less than 1/2 of the full ribbon is actually the artwork is so really to see these nice details like 3 soap or something.",
    "We have to zoom in there a lot.",
    "So I would say let these images be big and maybe put the titles on top or like overlap the corners or something.",
    "But like these images that are smaller on the side or the ones that like I really want to see you know.",
    "See, I'm not looks great.",
    "The colors are cool, I just think about you with colored symbolism.",
    "You really want to use one colors for like melt.",
    "It makes sense.",
    "So when it's like blue or like this like light blue, dark blue is something like Oh maybe that's like freezing or something so it's like give me like the opposite 5.",
    "I think love came out really great.",
    "You could even try shifting over some of this a little bit, but I seen the owl is kind of like there to frame the edge of the heart is just this Easter skits squish little bit over here and you start to lose like that bottom like leg.",
    "Yeah, I really want to get into those details.",
    "You know something.",
    "Just zoom in some more.",
    "So we had tents right here.",
    "If when I was zoomed out that far I had no idea there was a second T there, and so I think it's a clever idea.",
    "But to make sure you're communicating as clear as possible 'cause when you have this big ribbon case study and have small details like that, that's when they really started last, especially when the images smaller but so.",
    "Yeah, this works well.",
    "I would maybe even think about like.",
    "Hum, who's like Becky's project, how she did like the bubbles, how it's like, a light white and then maybe like blue around the edges.",
    "I don't think about the colours are using too, so it's so maybe you something that like kind of looks a little like soapier like Airy.",
    "Or yeah I thought Flowers in there too, but those elements do start to get lost whenever it's like showing very small.",
    "I do love this textures you're putting inside this box.",
    "I think that looks really good.",
    "It's remind me to text your dad like Hank Washington uses when he makes like his fuzzy illustrations.",
    "If you are familiar with them.",
    "Sexy.",
    "Yeah, he's talking a lot.",
    "So persuading not.",
    "Persuading not possible.",
    "So.",
    "To be honest, like I'm looking for the message persuading not possible, so maybe there's like a comma in there.",
    "Or maybe like I don't know.",
    "It's just hard for me to like understand like the meaning behind it.",
    "Maybe it's just going completely over my head or something.",
    "Nothing when you work with text like this, maybe even find a way to bring this up a little bit so you can start to see how like.",
    "This type of the T sticks up above this text a little bit, but it could be cool for that fit in like right there in that piece.",
    "So it's like persuading.",
    "It's like not like the T here and then like possible and maybe like these three letters fit in right before that G and so they start to feel like very like nested inside of each other for it feels like it's locked up together.",
    "Yeah, this is hard this kid so it looks like it's a little pixelated.",
    "So you're like gmail.com?",
    "Yeah, I think about when you're showing like phone numbers actually break it up.",
    "How you kind of see a phone number of looks like 334 like little hyphen or princis, just that super clear like what the number is.",
    "And then gmail.com.",
    "Maybe think about that's an email like including like a username at Gmail to see you to have like the approximate like length of like that text.",
    "And then being project this.",
    "So let me zoom out.",
    "Bill rose 6 million.",
    "Yeah, this one's whole PS project.",
    "The last one was this case study so it's cool.",
    "Yeah, I would really just scale this up like a lot and maybe like this image.",
    "Like think about like having scaled to where it's like even close to the edge of the whole edge.",
    "That's super cool.",
    "Yeah, thank you for sharing.",
    "And let me know if you have another project we check out to go check out jeans from Hawks kitchen.",
    "Look Something, let me try this little search here and then we'll see the chat student participated.",
    "Yeah, let me know if you have anything.",
    "Let me check out.",
    "Even if it's an older one to be happy too.",
    "Let me try something else.",
    "If somebody just keeps on moving down here.",
    "Just second, I'm looking on the other monitor real quick.",
    "Cool so Jane, I actually didn't find in discord, but it's probably like a little further back, so I clicked on your page and I found it's like, you know, the AI challenge vanderhoff rattle in there.",
    "So let me know for sure if this is the one.",
    "I do remember this one, which is really cool.",
    "So yeah, I think.",
    "If you did participate in this last one too, it could be really cool to show all this like in a case study, kind of like what we did on Friday is daily creative challenge.",
    "We're going to feel like a whole ribbon of it all laid out 'cause I think this works to kind of see it, but it's almost like too many images at once that, like when I view it, I get kind of overwhelmed and Marcus.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Yeah, no problem anytime.",
    "But what works with this too is I can click on it kind of review them individually.",
    "So I send you link please.",
    "Yeah gene, if you have a link that you want to drop in the chat, if it's different than this, then Yeah, it looks you or if not this is the one that you're thinking about like so let me know.",
    "Sound like zoom in like looking really close.",
    "Cool.",
    "Right, so it is cool.",
    "Um, yeah.",
    "So I think it's really nice how James Kitchens in that type faces.",
    "But then whenever you do like whole food recipes and like this down here, it starts to get a little tougher to read.",
    "Maybe you better do like a more like body copy typefaces like the secondary one and then have like the James Kitchen in like that script typeface.",
    "But I love this.",
    "It's like a very vintage like.",
    "That cookbook design that you see nothing is green.",
    "The Civil War looks great too.",
    "Local numbers look at you.",
    "Yeah, this looks great.",
    "What's up just some notification?",
    "What's going on?",
    "Hey Keith, yeah so I'm just looking over some of the AI daily crave challenges from this past week and from like recent ones.",
    "And you have a project you want to share?",
    "Want me to check out?",
    "Just let me know I'm going to be doing for maybe like another 1520 minutes at most.",
    "So yeah, if you have one that you want me to check out, drop the link in the chat or in the discord and I'll be happy to review it and give feedback.",
    "Was going to see it.",
    "Um?",
    "So yeah, so the James Kitchen.",
    "I think you wouldn't want to make this types face much larger than this, but then you have this space in here that feels kind of like awkward to me.",
    "Yes, I wonder too if the text may be stronger.",
    "Even just having like at the base down here.",
    "Also is nicely addict little number so we can talk about like 0123 or 4 maybe make sure they're all kind of level or maybe like after the corner or something.",
    "I do like the shading on this a lot.",
    "I think it looks really good.",
    "But this one is probably my favorite just because it's like the least amount of colors.",
    "And if you work, I think it works best as like a logo in the long run.",
    "You could definitely scale up PS like established 20 and Aidc.",
    "I think you may be scaled up to fit this whole space and maybe use like a body copy one.",
    "Look, I got tagged in something.",
    "So we bring over here for a second.",
    "Let me minimize that for a second cool, um.",
    "Yeah, I think we've lost speech.",
    "You probably scale is a little bit.",
    "You also have like this stroke that surround the text, which I don't think you really need.",
    "I think you probably just leave just the green Phil 'cause like with this one, how is just the black text.",
    "I think those nicely.",
    "But then when you have like the little stroke that gets around there like there's going to be, you won't be able to scale it down too much more without that stroke.",
    "Kind of like disappearing.",
    "So yeah, maybe just try to make it work without it.",
    "Didn't mean you nice.",
    "Yeah, this pattern around is cool I think since there's so many of them, that's almost like hypnotising me or drop me in a little bit.",
    "Um?",
    "I think would be cool if you had some of these and maybe you like reversed one and so we found a way to kind of like having a fit in together.",
    "It's kind of like help make the pattern that wage war it's like even the same one may be scaled.",
    "Maybe rotate different directions so they kind of fit inside.",
    "It's like message each other if that makes sense.",
    "And didn't even maybe put the Opacity and have it like salty rich where it's like, not just like why don't black.",
    "Maybe it's like come now mid grey, like different Gray or something or it's like more subtle.",
    "Let's see I think this title of here looks great.",
    "I think many of James kitchen here.",
    "You maybe don't need it again right here and then I think we are using this design a little too much.",
    "If there's a way to do like.",
    "Baby push like this do like a pattern or something and then use that.",
    "I think it would help a lot to bring like other elements into it.",
    "Uhm yeah.",
    "When I said to look at the actual text, it breaks down.",
    "I think this is good.",
    "However, like lined up, I like that the starters shares pasta, pizza.",
    "Those are all like larger so I can bounce around on.",
    "Keep building by Behance page.",
    "I'm reading a personal logo age uplink in there.",
    "Don't know.",
    "I'll check that out after this.",
    "Windows Phone Jane.",
    "Nickelodeon.",
    "I love how using the white on that lighter color, it's going to be hard for to come out like even printed, but it's a very nice like subtle element, so if you could do create like a pattern or something, maybe have that be like this white on this very light color so it's like something that's like hard to see until it's like physically right there.",
    "Something else, choose the prices so it kind of bounces around between different sides out.",
    "Maybe think about having left side or almost like the right aligned or something, but making sure it's very clear, like where these prices are, or if it's a right next to the titles.",
    "So I'll just make sure it's not consistent.",
    "He weighed thanks for tuning in.",
    "Nice to see you.",
    "I'm glad you joined in the chat.",
    "You're right now.",
    "You don't know.",
    "Moderate are shield though you know.",
    "Hum venoms reducing the illustrator daily creative challenges.",
    "Glad you're here.",
    "So James Kitchen awesome.",
    "So I think this is great.",
    "This text.",
    "I think it may be scaled up little bit.",
    "You probably in this corner.",
    "Maybe like a little bigger so that way, like really contrast with everything else.",
    "I love how the bread came out really nice.",
    "I'm just gradient.",
    "The colors work feel grounded.",
    "Killing spree, I would just say with the civil war here.",
    "Um, maybe play with like blurring the inside of it.",
    "Or like an opacity or something and maybe make a white and make it like a 20% opacity or something towards like it.",
    "Feels like you're looking through like class or something else so you have to catch one.",
    "Yeah awesome and this is one of my normal streams are like anyways too but.",
    "Yeah, that's awesome.",
    "Glad to hear.",
    "Nice, you know.",
    "So whatever we do it like Hawks kitchen as well.",
    "And we started with like Steaks like branding like letters onto him.",
    "Yeah, the substrate, so something with the civil war out.",
    "Maybe think about having like that filled in somehow, like playing with you can blur that or make it like very like transparent.",
    "Yeah, but I think this will greatly eggs like around that.",
    "All of that and like the edge of the mushrooms came out really nice.",
    "This feels like it may be a little too bright kissing.",
    "I fell.",
    "I know some of you by now with the I feel like I know some of you by now with the Adobe hands activities.",
    "No, that's awesome.",
    "None like same way too.",
    "Like how no waves with other people and waiting.",
    "I know I'm shield this, I know right?",
    "I could upgrade you but you know who knows what you end up doing.",
    "Um?",
    "But yeah, I think it's cool.",
    "I think it could be nice to try to bring like a texture.",
    "On top of that, like burger.",
    "It would be really cool to show that.",
    "And then also I like that it's transparent.",
    "Maybe even bring that down just a little bit.",
    "And now it says James Kitchen.",
    "I think that could also be.",
    "Less dark riders.",
    "Maybe just bring the opacity down by 50%.",
    "And yeah, I love that you'd like to checkerboard like picnic table like background.",
    "But then you have like these lines that I don't think are less like 100% necessary, especially when you look at the thickness between that one.",
    "And then you look at between there.",
    "There are a little off so I would just play with them.",
    "Yeah, just how that lines up is something we're gonna have.",
    "So nice, yes.",
    "So you start playing like filling in some of these two.",
    "So even like these colors, how you doing?",
    "It's maybe like bring down the opacity little bit.",
    "Bye love you have the colors inside here.",
    "This is great.",
    "He was like definitely soup and then you have the logo over here.",
    "Using is like a corner element so this is a different version of it too.",
    "'cause you don't have that like half circle shape around it.",
    "Which I think this works.",
    "It's just again this space right here between the words really stand out to me a lot.",
    "The positive and I see these are filled in.",
    "I think that helps a lot.",
    "In this so this looks really good as like a decorative element on the plate, so I would even recommend.",
    "Yeah, maybe making that like a lot softer and having a continue 'cause I know there's a lot of like very fancy plates and stuff.",
    "I do like Flowers, another like decorative elements on them.",
    "So I think that could be really cool.",
    "But yeah, the parcel of straight.",
    "I think the cheese.",
    "Maybe we played with little bit more summerlike strings.",
    "Whether this was like a glob you know, so feel different and like I say I want your soup right, looks good.",
    "Cool yeah I remember this one as well.",
    "I think before you had wine glasses that were at different angle.",
    "Keeps saying my typing skills are peckish can lead to typos, no worries.",
    "And that's something that like happens to me all the time too.",
    "And what helps me a lot is just having someone else who hasn't been looking at it.",
    "Just look at it real quick 'cause usually like a fresh pair of eyes can like go along ways.",
    "See, you show multiple things on here which is cool you're showing like the pie like the chart, but it's also like with the edge of the crust, which came out really nice.",
    "You get this little shadow that's going on that works really well.",
    "These ones are like 3D which is dope.",
    "And this cake?",
    "Yeah, there's a lot of cool elements going on here.",
    "I think what throws me off, she was like the angle, little bit 'cause I'm looking at it like OK, this one's top down.",
    "While some of these are like 3D and then some of these are top down and these are looking on the ledge I would just say whatever you're trying to show.",
    "Make sure it's all may be showing out like the exact same like angle or separate images.",
    "But I think you did a great job, but like this cake and like a lot of these different like objects inside of here.",
    "Ooh yeah nice.",
    "Yeah, he really just push it and trying out like a lot of recipes.",
    "Yeah, this is great.",
    "I like that you're doing different pie chart pie from Wendy.",
    "I know, right?",
    "That was one of the challenges we did too, so it's like.",
    "Make an infographic and we kind of making it into like a physical pie as well.",
    "It reminds me of like there's episode of How I Met Your Mother, where it's like it's like a bar chart of my favorite pies and like a pie chart of my favorite bars.",
    "And it's like that you like graphics.",
    "Yeah these are great.",
    "Like you really took like this, we learned you really are starting off lights like other foods which is like came out really nice.",
    "Like these that looks great.",
    "Yeah, I think this line on top of their really stands up to me, but I'm not exactly sure what it is, so I can't really critique it.",
    "Looks maybe that's how it looks.",
    "Why is there no dedicated channel for in design?",
    "Is the deli is asking?",
    "I have no clue.",
    "I guess there's only certain amount of channels you can have dedicated to something or it's just like if people are interested in that right in the discord channels and be like yo we want in design will do it like we want it.",
    "'cause it didn't.",
    "Do you have enough?",
    "People were like saying they're interesting.",
    "They will definitely consider it is I agree, in design is like incredible.",
    "I mean awesome.",
    "My other videos are based on like the stuff I was doing in in design.",
    "So if you want like some.",
    "Key stuff this help me set up.",
    "Check those out.",
    "There's also answer Hawk rattle.",
    "I know he was going really deep into in design and there's some stuff you can really learn from him about using like tables and like Excel documents and like some crazy next level in design stuff.",
    "Who is cool?",
    "So for this challenge they had to go and make like a there's like a seating chart and kind of make the floor plan of like oh here's like the Hostess or host running through that with like their custom brush.",
    "Yeah, it's awesome.",
    "Nice yeah, thanks for sharing.",
    "I think it came out really good.",
    "I was just here trying to build a case study and show it all is like a long ribbon maybe.",
    "So let me bring some stuff up over here.",
    "Make sure I'm in the right channel before I switch back over.",
    "Yep, getting very close to wrapping up too.",
    "So if there's anything else you guys want to go over, let me know.",
    "I think there's one in the chat amount of missed waiting.",
    "Yeah, that was great sessions.",
    "Oh, it definitely was.",
    "Yeah Andrew Harleys.",
    "Awesome super fun.",
    "So let me go and check over here.",
    "I think there is a link I missed.",
    "From Keith And I think this is probably my last one today too.",
    "And so if you want to see more of these, let me know if you want to see more me designer working like in design, different program, let me know 'cause I'm open to whatever.",
    "Put it, minimize that.",
    "Let me just bring over kids.",
    "Project he shared as well.",
    "Sweet, something minimize this.",
    "There goes.",
    "So the keep doesn't design, so I know you mentioned your reworking right here on like personal branding, so it's cool if it was.",
    "Any feedback in chat, you know.",
    "So yeah, I love that you're using like it's not like a black color, but it's like an awful dark grayish color.",
    "I think it's a really great.",
    "I think that works.",
    "Yeah, I think it works well.",
    "It's not like reading something inside.",
    "Cool, did you get a little description about yourself as well?",
    "It works well.",
    "See you shouldn't like how it's mapped out and how you use like internal pieces of the logo for like measurements.",
    "I think that's that works well.",
    "I don't think you need to specify word marking letter Mark.",
    "I think even just showing like one of these would work or something.",
    "Hum, so yeah, I would think about you, the grid layout.",
    "So keep saying I have started a project called what the fonts fonts based on puns.",
    "That's awesome.",
    "So yeah, with this to out, think about like maybe setting up like a grid system of like breaking this one graphic up into thirds and saying OK just left side third is going to be like the colors in like color codes.",
    "The middle third is going to be like these and like the right third will be like these darker ones.",
    "And then maybe just like I think having those like lined up for you will help it look more consistent when you view it all because right here how bounce between these.",
    "They feel very like.",
    "I know this feels very disconnected from the other stuff to me.",
    "I love that you're giving this, like all this detail, but yeah, I think there could be a way to do that.",
    "Or maybe you show all the logos and colors like left and right like stacked right here and then you go into the logo variations below it.",
    "So you would think maybe other divided up into thirds and doing it.",
    "That way you can do like this or maybe like separating them like different levels.",
    "Enough.",
    "So yeah, let's take some mockups.",
    "You so I love that you are using one of these.",
    "I really show a lot of well rounded sides of the brand and how you actually have like a label on here.",
    "You have like the letter head.",
    "This may be a little larger.",
    "The letter head with scale it down a little bit.",
    "And, Uh, Yeah, I think this looks good under the folder.",
    "The pin.",
    "So think about the text that's on this.",
    "I know it's small right here, but it's going right next to the edges.",
    "Just saw an error.",
    "Yeah, I don't see yet though, so maybe I'll see it.",
    "Yeah, all those edges.",
    "Yeah I would try to bring those in a little bit.",
    "I think it's cool you showing the app you know CD.",
    "Yeah, all these I would say to it looks like you're showing the same logo and like.",
    "Similar ways and maybe think about like OK, is there like a type of like very subtle pattern I can add like on this folder deck and also had the business card like maybe there's like.",
    "Like some other way to really bring it to the next level, you know, like something else you can add to the brand.",
    "Just have really help you feel more than just like text colors in a logo, but also like you bring in additional elements and symbols somehow to really just push even further.",
    "So type these.",
    "I like that you're showing these.",
    "I think all three of these can be brought like side by side, so it's like 123 and then stick with the same grid system that you'd use up here.",
    "So that way it's like OK, one column to column, three column.",
    "You're doing the same thing here within text, so that way like it fuels like flows a little better that way.",
    "Local variations, incorrect ways of doing it.",
    "Cool, fair, something with like maybe lining up at like 3 columns and kind of like shut him lined up that way.",
    "Yeah, great work.",
    "Appreciate you Sean does that too.",
    "It just be conscious, I think.",
    "Oh yeah, maybe this area insult you if it is like this box goes above that.",
    "Maybe that's a little closer to that.",
    "Yeah, I think that would get like separated a little bit.",
    "Yes, super cool though.",
    "Thank you for sharing and I'm going offline guys but.",
    "If you if you are interested in participating in the next challenge, is actually let me go and bring up that link really fast.",
    "So.",
    "Behas.net dash AI.",
    "I think this is it.",
