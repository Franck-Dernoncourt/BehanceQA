    "Oh rude.",
    "I thought it would go behind it didn't.",
    "Alright, well Jake and Meg are going to be cutoff then that's fine.",
    "Maybe I'll just do that.",
    "And Meg's going to be hidden.",
    "And that's OK by me, 'cause I don't really like back now.",
    "I'm kidding.",
    "Um?",

    "I think this was the best one we can work with, so let's photo shop that open with my photo shop.",
    "Where is my photo shop?",
    "There we go.",
    "I like I still like the still prefer the photo editing capabilities inside photo shop versus inside XD but that's the point of having you know, a suite of things, right?",
    "There we go and I'm literally just going to because it will be easiest.",
    "I'm just going to do content aware.",
    "Oh So OK, scratch disks or what?",
    "Scratch disks are full.",
    "Well, that's not cool.",
    "OK.",

    "I should have said that to default and I didn't.",
    "There we go.",
    "Phil content aware perfect.",
    "Well, content aware perfect we save it.",
    "What was it a P, PNG or JPEG?",
    "Properties.",
    "JPEG OK.",
    "Because we're going to replace it dope, dope, dope.",
    "No, I don't need to say that we're going to X out and then we'll just replace it, not know.",
    "There we go.",
    "Look at how nice he is now.",
    "By nice I mean murderous.",
    "He some muscular.",

    "Dead by daylight.",
    "School map.",
    "Silent Hill.",
    "Pink mental help us maybe.",
    "Oh, that's actually a really.",
    "Open in a new tab.",
    "Oh, that's just the one we already looked at.",
    "It looks so much better when it's smaller.",
    "I guess you know.",
    "That's OK, that's the one we already looked at, I think.",
    "That looks pretty cool.",
    "Open image in a new tab.",
    "OK, that's helpful also.",
    "We want to be focused on the map.",
    "This one seems to photo shop didn't look right.",
    "Or was it called Brookhaven?",
    "I didn't actually know that.",
    "OK, we got some lockers.",
    "Yeah, I think we have the best ones.",
    "The best ones possible.",
    "Definitely the chains in the in the courtyard look incredible.",
    "That one looks like it's from the movie.",
    "Maybe I can't tell.",
    "Now it says it's titled Dead by daylight.",
    "Oh, I didn't close out of that, but that's fine.",
    "Right, let's go with this guy.",
    "Ah, don't, but it turned down all right, that's It.",
    "Looks really nice, I think.",
    "Let's try for this one actually.",
    "Oh yeah.",
    "I feel like that that looks that is such power to it almost.",
    "I don't know though.",
    "This one looks good too.",
    "But it's again, it's feels like it's featuring pyramid had, so I think will stick.",
    "Two, let's delete things or not using so that one's gone.",
    "And again I was opening photo shop 'cause it's a PNG.",
    "I was just that got really dark one of that same image.",
    "It's OK photo shop, you can close, it's OK, everything is going to be OK.",
    "Alright, those are possible.",
    "Other ones.",
    "We can use.",
    "Those are two features are three features, excuse me.",
    "Yeah, I like this one better.",
    "Cool alright.",
    "Um?",
    "I definitely think the background of this should be black.",
    "I think that's an easy win.",
    "Her maybe not black.",
    "What is the?",
    "Maybe it should be like I don't know.",
    "Man, I could definitely should have a texture to it.",
    "I do think that these all need a shadow, though I think it would look really good with a shadow, so we're going to add a shadow.",
    "Let's say it's 2 two.",
    "Is it not letting me use numlock?",
    "Yeah I did.",
    "I wanna set zero and zero excuse me.",
    "Gonna work something like that.",
    "Beer be letting dog out.",
    "Already read that.",
    "And whatever other for that we got.",
    "We got trial assets, other an forum so these ones could feel.",
    "I don't different I guess, but I don't know how they want him to feel related to these all these ones.",
    "Hum.",
    "Well, Meanwhile let's grab good by daylight.",
    "Logo.",
    "Another word, search SVG so I can get the.",
    "The Vector.",
    "Perfect as a PNG, but that's OK.",
    "OK, so that's actually I needed to be the horizontal one.",
    "Or be.",
    "SVG so.",
    "We've got divisor.",
    "The faithful to doesn't help us, unfortunately.",
    "Others appeared to PNG in the dark.",
    "Alright, let's just open this up with any tab.",
    "Luna.",
    "I know, but we're not doing that are we?",
    "We're not.",
    "We're not going to do that.",
    "Alright, so I think what I'm going to do is actually we're just going to crop.",
    "Crop this I've been working on.",
    "My God my dog is having a heart attack.",
    "Oh, shush.",
    "Be quiet Year 5.",
    "Spell solid color no, no image image image.",
    "All right, uhm?",
    "So I'm gonna do it.",
    "Actually I just paste it, do that.",
    "That's not what I want.",
    "Instead of doing that, I want to do.",
    "Wanted just drag and drop so that it's really big which is.",
    "Totally fine.",
    "Then we're going to mask it 2 separate ways, so the first one.",
    "Let me grab a rectangle.",
    "Master shape there we go.",
    "So now the shape is going to be.",
    "This will shrink extend this guy, but it's got all the pieces in.",
    "Oh, I made an extra rectangle on accident.",
    "Right, that was fine.",
    "And then we're going to duplicate this.",
    "Make a second one.",
    "And this one is going to have.",
    "The focus on hit this piece right here.",
    "OK, so.",
    "Then will shrink to a Sky down.",
    "Need to judge has big you should be interesting to be a little bit smaller.",
    "I kind of want it to be like this, but I don't.",
    "I don't think that's what they have.",
    "Maybe if I wonder if I Google.",
    "Dead by daylight.",
    "Bright like brand guidelines.",
    "Sales.",
    "For any part.",
    "How to use brand new part?",
    "How do use Brendan part?",
    "It's not it's not uhm?",
    "That's funny, uh, maybe I'll just do little guidelines 'cause the word brand is confusing the search alot.",
    "OK, so they have here.",
    "They actually don't have.",
    "Yes yes, yes.",
    "I'm old enough for this, but please enter your data birth alright I'm trying to you won't let me.",
    "Everyone started.",
    "I know that I am.",
    "28 years old who?",
    "Alright, so it does have it here.",
    "OK, so let me just want to take a screenshot of that.",
    "And then I'll be able to size mine according to that screenshot.",
    "Save to downloads.",
    "And that way I won't be wrong.",
    "I'll be able to.",
    "Oh, that's not what I meant to do.",
    "Alright, so let's bring this guy up in size and then reduces opacity his her.",
    "Whatever.",
    "OK, so it actually has the.",
    "The letters a lot bigger than I thought it would be.",
    "That sort of like here I've got this guy.",
    "Wow, that's a lot bigger than I thought it would be.",
    "Teensy bit smaller than I have it.",
    "All right?",
    "So technically it should be like that holy cow that feels very out waited, but.",
    "We might just.",
    "I'll keep it like that for now and then will we might it might change it.",
    "Once we got logo.",
    "What is with this bug that I keep finding that I can't change the names of things so strange?",
    "L.",
    "Why can I only hit certain buttons I don't understand?",
    "Is it not like my L button?",
    "I don't understand.",
    "Free name Yeah I can't.",
    "Alright, let's just keep it there.",
    "I like that it feels similar, but.",
    "That's fine.",
    "Down down, down.",
    "Z.",
    "Bump, Bump, Bump Bump.",
    "Alright, so then we've got would say it was our trial assets.",
    "So those are perks.",
    "What if I just search images of DVD perks?",
    "I don't know how other people the game people treat it OK.",
    "That's interesting, I don't hate that as a wallpaper 20.",
    "That's cool.",
    "Except this is actually wrong because none of the perks have this.",
    "The pink color.",
    "Because.",
    "Hum.",
    "Perks for.",
    "I'd have to like recreate that essentially if I wanted to do that type of concept, but.",
    "I think I would like something more cinematic.",
    "You know what I mean?",
    "I think this is definitely going to be black, so I'll make that black.",
    "Um?",
    "Kind of like the idea of this piece being oh, it's not even a square.",
    "Some background that I've created.",
    "Arranged into back.",
    "I also think that this blur needs to extend further, but.",
    "Oh, and I also only have it at 16%.",
    "I feels better maybe.",
    "Bring up after 20.",
    "It does not like nothing.",
    "Something is going around my PC where it doesn't want to type numbers.",
    "OK fine.",
    "Not very nice of you.",
    "Oh, but then I just.",
    "did I change the color of it when I did that?",
    "Yeah I did.",
    "The problem with this is if I make it black then the shadow doesn't actually show it shine through it all.",
    "So.",
    "I'm hoping that I can.",
    "Maybe this should be.",
    "The whole thing and be like a.",
    "Uh, range sent it back.",
    "Make it a, uh.",
    "Percentage thing I deleted that, though I don't want to do that.",
    "This can be sent back now.",
    "I will make this just a gradient linear gradient.",
    "There it goes from.",
    "Black to black, but this one is this.",
    "I won't do that.",
    "Almost there to this over here.",
    "Kind of like that.",
    "And then we should.",
    "I should lock this.",
    "So I can't touch it and then.",
    "This guy should have a different texture.",
    "Or maybe instead of it being Oh yeah yeah, maybe I should do something like the rough edges.",
    "It sort of has.",
    "Not sure.",
    "So they could be ashamed to not use this image of spirit.",
    "She looks so cool.",
    "Maybe go see in the forum.",
    "I liked how real that one looks, that's like.",
    "My gripe with the consistency here that I've created.",
    "All right, we're going to copy this, paste it in place.",
    "And make it black.",
    "AH 60% oh OK.",
    "Now this is rejecting my my numpad completely.",
    "Let me 75 instead.",
    "Now you know what, let me just make it full black and adjust the opacity of the object.",
    "That's what I'll be able to do, control more.",
    "My dog is having a heart attack.",
    "All right, 60 does feel right actually.",
    "So do that.",
    "I don't know what that I think that I'm trying to figure out what type of.",
    "Text that is trial assets.",
    "Say my keyboard movies fighting me, I can't tell.",
    "Yeah, it's not letting me type.",
    "I don't know what's going on.",
    "Um will save this really quick.",
    "I'm just going to quit out of XT and reopen it.",
    "Also, I'm going to open notepad, confirm that it's not my keyboard.",
    "Yeah, everything is working fine in here, so something is going on with XD.",
    "That won't let me type my letters type all my stuff.",
    "Alright, try that again.",
    "Alright, let's try this again.",
    "Try there we go.",
    "Yeah, sometimes it's just going out wrong with it.",
    "I'll make this white, I'll make this.",
    "Well, first I kind of want to figure out what what font this is.",
    "Somebody like font?",
    "No, not that.",
    "That doesn't help me.",
    "Alright, let's search all instead of just images.",
    "Identify bot font Roboto Easy Peasy.",
    "Then I was gonna say it was other opens and it's a Google font.",
    "I knew immediately so that's really funny.",
    "Do I have her botto in this list?",
    "Probably not.",
    "Now.",
    "So.",
    "Football fans.",
    "Luckily Google has open source fonts, so we can just download.",
    "And.",
    "Don't let me.",
    "I want I wanted to install all of them.",
    "How dare you?",
    "OK, well let's just mean.",
    "Let me do it.",
    "I'm so sorry to everyone is watching this.",
    "It's being not very nice to me.",
    "Another another thing I prefer about my Mac is the installation process with fonts.",
    "Fill out more in control.",
    "Alright, I think it's good.",
    "Fish and be able to grab it now.",
    "Never go.",
    "There was a little bit of tracking.",
    "Or you know what I should do is just do that by.",
    "And think it up to it.",
    "And suddenly light.",
    "Which is, you know, dead by daylight?",
    "Maybe it isn't how many tracking?",
    "Maybe it's just the basic.",
    "Yeah, all right now we know.",
    "Now we know this.",
    "Trial assets, and then I'm just going to size it based on what makes sense.",
    "Center it as well.",
    "So I think it's better when we do this.",
    "She's up line height, alittle bit.",
    "Um?",
    "Little smaller OK Papa.",
    "What's two 4048 on 45 that feels good?",
    "Alright, so that's sort of, I think that it does need some tracking, though I'm not as fond of it without.",
    "Oh 20 is good.",
    "Trial assets and that maybe I'll go 75 on this actually.",
    "70 So the problem is that this one almost feels like it's like it's already going to try and edit this info to shop.",
    "So I think it's a little dark, you know.",
    "Alright, let's just mess with it a little bit.",
    "Scratch disk for full.",
    "What is that?",
    "I don't even know what that means.",

    "I think I would like to switch Twitch and Twitter.",
    "And that would be.",
    "It might feel more balanced.",
    "I'm also going to center these not that way this way.",

    "But then will adjust it afterwards, 'cause that rarely is that actually accurate.",
    "That already is 45.",
    "This on the width is going to be 45.",
    "Oh, and I did it again where I have.",
    "I didn't lock it there either today, alright?",
    "Sounds fine, 'cause that ones actually locked.",
    "This is now locked and this will be 45.",
    "Not blocked, this is now locks and will be 45.",
    "This would be locked in for this.",
    "One's actually people, so they'll be smaller.",
    "Locked that's 45.",
    "What does that feel?",
    "Hopefully I didn't mess that up.",
    "I don't know though.",
    "45's locked that one is locked.",
    "OK, I'm a big liar and now I'm going to actually going to shrink all of it.",
    "'cause this is at 100% and I kind of wanted to be a little smaller.",
    "Distribute should be an option.",
    "Forget where it is to do that.",
    "It there we go let's these ones no, no wrong one.",
    "It is going to be vertically great.",

    "OK, and I always do this then this.",
    "I swear this works.",
    "I do this contest where you squint to see which is taking up a lot of visual weights and right now Twitter is taking a little bit too much to shrink it a teensy bit.",
    "Yeah, that feels good.",
    "So now my group these together.",
    "And the social has been taken care of perfect.",
    "Um, don't actually know where the center out there it is.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Thank you auto auto alignment there alright.",

    "That's a new one.",
    "Squint test while be damned.",
    "Yeah, it's it's real, learn didn't learn his art school.",
    "Alright, so now we can.",
    "I'm going to delete the ones I already had in my thing which is touched.",
    "These ones and then I'm going to use these ones later to fill up my repository of logos that I'm always pulling from.",
    "And we've got what else should I write in the Sitemap I wrote?",
    "So this.",
    "Sorry.",
    "Page as well.",

    "Excuse me, I would just like to select this.",
    "That would be great, thank you.",
    "Yeah, kind of OK I tried.",
    "I have a coworker or I'm currently on a project with someone named Shawn spelled your spelled your way, but he pronounced it Sean.",
    "So I wasn't sure if I was close or not I have a tomato seed stuck to my hand.",
    "What is happening OK?",
    "So I've got assets there we've got.",
    "Did it to do oh, I lost track of what I was doing.",
    "OK footer we need uhm the official website which is our lovely guy here.",
    "And then maybe behaviors official website as well.",
    "I'm going to do this text links, so we're going to balance it out we've got.",
    "Um?",
    "Behavior official page.",
    "That will make that like a light Gray, maybe instead of.",
    "We're going to save Robotto because that is.",
    "The brand.",
    "I'm gonna shrink this and I'm going to.",
    "We're going to repeat grids so when we were P credit forces.",
    "Am I making just a million textboxes text box right now?",
    "OK, there it goes to repeat grid.",
    "Then we can create multiple ones of this that are equally separate from each other, which is what we want.",
    "So we've got.",
    "Dead by daylight.",
    "Official page.",
    "I'm actually going to extend this and less than the.",
    "How is it not going to let me do that?",
    "OK, that's that's great and I want this to stay there, but I would like it too.",
    "Oh oh, there we go.",
    "That's what I didn't do.",
    "Well, let's do.",
    "Sero I guess because.",
    "This I got a little too big.",
    "And this is a little too small.",
    "There we go.",
    "OK, so I've got that now and we're going to shrink this.",
    "'cause I don't plan on having actually.",
    "Um?",
    "There we go.",
    "0 on that.",
    "Don't plan on having more than one.",
    "Thing here will sent note note.",
    "Accident right behavior official page.",
    "Um?",
    "Let's see.",
    "That's where chat goes.",
    "If you're bad thrown into the pit of logos, that would be pretty epic to be honest.",
    "Behavior official page dead by daylight.",
    "Official page.",
    "Once we got here, we got we got like the basic ones.",
    "Now we got merch store as well.",
    "I don't.",
    "I don't think this would want.",
    "I don't think we want.",
    "This is really a site intended for learning, so I don't think putting the merge on there as far as necessary.",
    "We definitely need a privacy policy in terms of use, so maybe it's those four.",
    "Right, and we're going to make.",
    "These are much smaller because.",
    "There are way too big.",
    "Apparently it doesn't want to do that to me.",
    "Alright, that's fine, we just gotta ungroup the grid, oh.",
    "That's tiny, OK?",
    "Alright, let's make fine.",
    "I feel bad.",
    "Let's make it 14 or maybe 16.",
    "This is 75%.",
    "So what's it at?",
    "100 that feels better, so let's do.",
    "Plus 216.",
    "Have That, and I don't think that we need it to actually be on 2 lines anymore.",
    "Now that I've changed the height.",
    "Could be worse.",
    "It could be a pit of cliche is imagine oh God, you're right, you're right.",
    "Well, well said Richard.",
    "And I'm just going to shrink these together, but what we're going to do now, oh, did not do that.",
    "Oh interesting.",
    "It just hurts the pages, but not the actual.",
    "All right?",
    "Right now will shrink this guy little bit.",
    "So where did this and 3456?",
    "56 And then.",
    "123456.",
    "Alright, so now those are equally apart.",
    "Will center them on the page.",
    "I think this are footer can remain relatively basic.",
    "Um?",
    "What else can we think of anything else?",
    "I accept the cookies so I guess we could do something like that, but that's not I feel like that's doesn't add to the design, but.",
    "Merch help what is help?",
    "Do the support page OK?",
    "Oh yeah this would be this is not the official page so that's why I have to keep that in mind.",
    "It's not like we're designing the official page.",
    "This is really more of a learning site so I think.",
    "This is good or what we can do instead of its entering it.",
    "We can do social on the right and links on the left.",
    "Do I?",
    "How do I feel about how do we feel about that?",
    "Um?",
    "Not hating it.",
    "I don't want to see.",
    "Just drop it.",
    "Oh, I feel like these are not.",
    "I guess they are just do that and then put these guys probably centered, which is pretty much centered right there.",
    "And then remove it.",
    "Oh Hit 0 instead of one.",
    "OK.",
    "That sounds good.",
    "I like that.",
    "Let's do that.",
    "Let's group these together.",
    "Alright Alright Alright.",
    "So, but there's all set.",
    "All of these are set.",
    "What else can we add before we jump to a page that is?",
    "An extended one of the pages so.",
    "One of these, the next one.",
    "This one needs to be taking.",
    "This needs to be taken care over here and.",
    "Maybe we are missing some information about this.",
    "Um, up top.",
    "Maybe we need something that says more about what this is.",
    "Let's call these guys down a tad.",
    "Yeah, I don't know.",
    "Right now guys I'm going to take.",
    "Right, I'm going to end stream.",
    "We're going to come back in like an hour.",
    "I've only done about an hour 40 right now.",
    "My intent was to go to at least three hours.",
    "I'm just going to do this.",
    "One is a short and then will continue this on this design in about an hour.",
    "I'm going to come back, but thank you so much for hanging out and I'll if you want to come back if you follow me.",
