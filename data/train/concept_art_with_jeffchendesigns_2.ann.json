    "1 character for lead character of one character for brave character, one for a joyful character.",
    "Mischievous character, serious character and wild creature character.",
    "Each character will tell their own story, with their clothing, adornments and gestures.",

    "Yeah, I really don't have any ideas so far.",
    "It's kind of pretty random, huh?",
    "I don't know if I'm going to go to unique and like.",
    "Two mysterious I might do, like some sort of.",
    "But maybe like I should go more comfort zone for me.",

    "And will so we need some stuff for like some Mac inspiration for enhancements in all that.",
    "Sci-fi robot will be pretty useful.",
    "I think the Bounty Hunter Page would be pretty interesting.",
    "Let's use that.",

    "But teaching maybe realize that shoulder mounted be talent for art and a lot of it is from our ability to work hard.",
    "And put the time in.",
    "But There is some element of it where there's like.",

    "They made him thinking about is.",
    "This shape.",
    "How that can be different from?",
    "These shapes or how they also relate slightly.",
    "See how there's like a general sort of.",
    "Like triangular shape I'm going for for these heads her as well.",
    "Other hers kind of caps off goes like poop.",
    "I have that idea, but I don't want it to be exactly the same, so they're related in that sense that they are.",
    "Kind of triangular.",
    "Discuss more square, definitely, but.",
    "They are related.",
    "But I want it to be different enough so that's not the same.",
    "Design.",
    "And again.",
    "It's my reference that's helping me out.",
    "I'm looking at stuff in there.",
    "Call the time.",

    "Like mentioned the whip and all that, but then I'm wondering if he looks so happy.",
    "He's got like a whip and this guys like depressed as hell.",
    "Does that look bad?",
    "I think it does.",
    "I think I'll just have him like excitedly holding the horns.",
    "So I'm going to make this how much bigger?",
    "And just kind of put him off screen so I can design the horns around.",
    "Designed this guy around the horns here.",
    "There we go.",
    "Perfect.",
    "Like a little new imp.",
    "Little happy hump on the back.",
    "A lot of designers, yeah, me thinking about silhouettes and how it can be different.",
    "I think anything significant that you want your viewers to see should be seen in the silhouette.",
    "So that's something to think about if you're not using that.",
    "He looked at, I think some.",
    "During the Dutch he's like half of his bed.",
    "I'll be back in 1 second.",

    "I'll play so much and then I was like Hell Yeah, New Horizon looks really cool.",
    "I got it and I played it and I was like that's what about everything I went through 'cause I felt very similar to to new leaf at the beginning is always somewhat similar and was like thinking about my whole thing going through newly files like mad.",
    "I can't play a game like that again, it's too much.",
    "Starting from scratch, although this is like there might be a lot of cool stuff that happens, but.",
    "Kind of seeds though.",
    "Oh my God, it's a stream dying constantly.",
    "How's the stream for other people?",
    "Mozzie, still in here house.",
    "How's the stream for you?",

    "I'm like wait what's the point like I'm doing this daily?",
    "Getting all this Golden like I'm like already.",
    "Max level in doing like end game stuff, but what's the point?",
    "Like why am I playing?",
    "What is it?",

    "That means tomorrow, maybe we can get through.",
    "Three, hopefully, if we do joyful and the creature together.",
    "I think that would be pretty cool.",
    "Yeah, I'm just going to keep refining these for the rest of this stream.",
    "I think.",
    "So next guy is going to be short would be something like.",
    "This brave Shorted fovea like normal human height or maybe shorter I think should be shown are like around this height.",
    "Mischievous would be like toll like around this height I think.",
    "And then we have serious too.",
    "Will be around this height, but like has a smaller head so it feels taller.",
    "I think that's what I'm sort of going for and the creature will be nice and low and then we get a good mix of.",
    "Sizes and characters and cool cost I think.",
    "Would you all agree?",
    "How come this color feels slightly different?",
    "It's annoying me.",
    "The same.",
    "That's weird.",
    "I guess I just have darker lines.",
    "Yeah, 10 minutes left.",
    "It's pretty awkward.",
    "Is anything anyone wants to ask in terms of character design, concept art.",
    "Gaming industry.",
    "What I've been up to.",
    "Just let me know.",
    "They just keep doodle in on this guy.",
    "Maybe brave should have like scars or something as well.",

    "Working together Looking pretty good.",
    "Did you figure out what you're going for?",
    "Other characters, hey movement.",
    "Not really, I know that I want to work joyful with creature together and I sort of have a pose for the slender guy, the mischievous guy.",

    "Usual head shave and face masks.",
    "Vista topic quite well, but I'm just changing that now.",
    "What do you think of this new head shape?",
    "He like now I'm offended.",
    "OK, let's vote one or two for the brave.",
    "This is one.",
    "This is too.",
    "And then will wrap up the stream.",
    "We sort of have to like that negative space is pretty cohesive with this ring that I have here.",
    "I think that's that's why I'm sort of.",
    "Feeling to a bit more.",
    "Not so this like from a read like from out here.",
