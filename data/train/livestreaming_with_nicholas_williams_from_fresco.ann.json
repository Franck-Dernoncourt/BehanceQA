    "There we go looking good looking swell.",
    "Now I'm going to be getting our purple again.",
    "Are nice little purple.",
    "Be praying that in.",

    "See, we cut into the.",
    "Blackholed every do not want to do that.",
    "There we go.",
    "So here's what we're going to do next, so let's zoom out a little bit.",
    "Started looking good.",
    "Now.",
    "We're going to be kind of selecting on how we're going to make this black hole really blended, 'cause it still.",
    "It's still kind of.",
    "Uhm, it's still look looking like an abstract sort of thing so.",
    "Here's what we're gonna do.",
    "We're going to find something that really.",
    "Brings it through.",
    "Towards the others, so I'm going to be bringing it down.",
    "Using the splatter.",
    "So the blending in.",
    "Can be taking.",
    "This and bring that in.",
    "Could be covering that.",
    "Making it really, really well.",
    "Now we're going to be.",
    "Blending even more clouds with it.",
    "Add soft.",

    "I think some.",
    "Highlight two at all.",

    "Here we go.",
    "All right?",

    "Some other colors going back to the color wheel.",
    "It's going to cover this way little too much there.",
    "There.",
    "To refreshing office of some stars from the scattered a little bit going to scatter that around it.",
    "Fix it up getting some white doing that as well, given the effect that there's small stars going back and we're going to be bringing out.",
    "These star scape.",
    "Do not to cross it a little bit.",
    "So you can see there.",
    "I want we zoom back out.",
    "Boom, it looks like the black hole is actually a part of it.",
    "It looks like the Galaxy was made around it, so you gotta make sure they blended in and it's looking absolutely swell.",
    "So that is the finisher for that.",
    "For that area where we're going to do is, we're going to brush lightly up against the edges of it to finish it off.",
    "And boom, just like that, you made yourself a beautiful little Galaxy.",
    "Next We're going to do.",
    "Is that we are going to?",
    "Fix this square circle boom.",
    "OK.",
    "So now we're going to be making our planet.",
    "Just like so right there, alright?",
    "So here's how we're going to be doing this.",
    "Could be having like it's going to be having some reflections off of the black hole of the light that it admits.",
    "So here's what we're going to be doing.",
    "We're going to be selecting this.",
    "I'm going to be feeling this with black.",
    "This will be selling with white.",
    "So you know we're looking poops little bit too much.",
    "There look at that OK.",
    "So we know what we're working with here.",
    "That's the planet that we're going to be working on.",
    "So we can make it to a gas giant.",
    "We can make it into a regular planet.",
    "What we could do is we could work on a gas giant for now because you got to have some logistics into this and such to make your art really feel alive and such.",
    "To kind of give it some idea of the realism in the world that we do have.",
    "So we're going to be making it a gas giant.",
    "And we're going to be kind of making it blue is kind of color, 'cause it's really far out in space and it's frozen and there's not much of light to warm it.",
    "So we're going to be making that would be having a blueish color.",
    "String with a nice blue color.",
    "Gonna be zooming in.",
    "I'm going to be rhyming the edge so it will be taking our circle again.",
    "Bring it back to where we were.",
    "We got it from.",
    "Going to be filling it as we did before, so.",
    "Right there looks really good.",
    "Like so we're going to keep it that.",
    "Going to fill that kind of keep it as so.",
    "Very carefully, very easily.",
    "Like so they're going to fill that with some white.",
    "So you know what we're working with here.",
    "We have our line.",
    "That showing our planet's atmosphere.",
    "Right there.",
    "So now we're going to be starting to shape it.",
    "So we can take different sorts of things.",
    "We can make it have rings or multiple planets around it.",
    "We can also do those kinds of certain things as well.",
    "Here we're going to be doing since it's only going to be a certain reflection, not the entire deep inside the planet isn't going to be fully.",
    "It's not going to be fully shown because it's only a small amount of light coming from the actual Galaxy itself, so.",
    "We're going to be doing is I would have taken better mixed and we're taking a nice little blue Hue.",
    "Will it to the wire side?",
    "Going to be kind of doing this very carefully to not get it onto the space like so.",
    "Like that OK gives it that Inter death be bringing that down a little bit.",
    "Good making certain lines.",
    "Showing the gas planets, different layers and such.",
    "Thanks so alright getting a little bit darker color.",
    "Really don't align it too.",
    "Give it that nice old Hugh.",
    "Even a little bit here, they turn down the flow.",
    "And we're going to be bringing it on the sides a little bit.",
    "And you can see here we go, but too much going to be bringing down the flow even more.",
    "Even more very slightly.",
    "We don't want to sell it too much.",
    "So you can see.",
    "Right here, giving it a Nestle Hugh little blend in Seattle sphere.",
    "K never getting it little bit lighter.",
    "Pretty light color to lie on the atmosphere.",
    "Make it blend in the space itself.",
    "Keep on doing that, we're satisfied.",
    "This down little bit.",
    "And So what we're looking at here?",
    "Perfect.",
    "Now will be taking some other colors, maybe some.",
    "Darker Blues, some darker Blues and will be taking different such when we taking maybe some sponge here and kind of lining it a little bit.",
    "Some purplish blueish use to kind of go along with the planets different such depths.",
    "Some lighter colors.",
    "I will be using.",
    "Some reason this the sponge again in the light colors.",
    "Lightly brush over them ever so lightly.",
    "And then you get a line top of them.",
    "Then Going to basically we're going to be taking hard round opacity.",
    "Bring it down.",
    "Every so sorry, so we're going with this.",
    "Giving it.",
    "So the depth that we're looking for, like kind of the different layers, really popping them out.",
    "But still keeping colors that were looking for.",
    "They were what we're going to do.",
    "Said it looks pretty good.",
    "Maybe we can put a little bit more like we can go down to.",
    "Let's see go back to FX.",
    "And go to the dusty.",
    "Get some darker colors.",
    "Darkness.",
    "Ever so slightly.",
    "Giving it some of the effects so then.",
    "I'm going to be taking our circle again.",
    "Bring it like so.",
    "Because we're going to be spending this little bit.",
    "Spinning it like so.",
    "Just like that.",
    "Will be filling that with some black.",
    "All the way dead black.",
    "But see, it looks a little bit off, you know, looks a little bit not so perfect.",
    "So here's how we're going to fix that.",
    "Could be going back.",
    "I'm going to be going back to Cloudsoft.",
    "Can be using our eyedropper again?",
    "I'm going to be doing.",
    "Little bit like this.",
    "Will be zooming in.",
    "Sort of blending it in as we did with the with the galaxies so it's going to be a long process, but.",
    "Makes it look much more natural and not like some kind of abstract structure.",
    "Shipping it again.",
    "Now will be taking all the way back to the basics that the hard round opacity.",
    "Zoom in.",
    "Kind of.",
    "Get real close and now put this down a lot more.",
    "K.",
    "Going down the line a little bit and then doing some kind of swivels here and there.",
    "Zoom out into this section.",
    "Good.",
    "Going down the line once more looks a little too much.",
    "There you can see.",
    "Very slightly, very slightly.",
    "And it looks a little bit off, so we're going to be doing that same thing again.",
