    "So I'm just going to screenshot some of this stuff.",
    "Wait the refresh help.",
    "I don't repress anything.",
    "I don't know what refresh.",
    "Sorry, I'm going to take a screenshot of this so I can talk to be hands about it.",
    "Basically what is happening it says like dropped frames twelve 1200.",
    "CPU is being used six 6% at 30 FPS.",
    "It seems like everything is fine.",
    "I got the green light so I have no idea what that issue is.",
    "Uh.",
    "Oh God Yeah, but that man.",
    "It just makes me so salty.",
    "I would just want because now when people come and I'm like, yeah, by the way it goes without re watch the replays it comes in like 2 freaking videos.",
    "It's not cute.",
    "It's not a good look.",
    "OK?",
    "Let's let's make this make this shadow happen, let's see.",
    "So we got like a little crisp of a line there.",
    "And what we're gonna do for that, let's see.",
    "Yes we are.",
    "We can do.",
    "So we've got the bottom one that has the shadow.",
    "Alright, let's see David saying there's an input buffer.",
    "When you stream of about 30 to 60 seconds.",
    "Not sure if he hands let's you change.",
    "YouTube does, yeah, I'm not sure.",
    "I'm really going to have to talk to be hands and see how they do all that.",
    "Nila eh?",
    "What's going on?",
    "Basically what you miss was 10 minutes of really good content that it got shut off and then we had to open this up.",
    "So we're basically from starting from Ground Zero, but basically we are recreating this application.",
    "We're going to be doing some neo morphism and some animation with this PS five store product.",
    "Or product store.",
    "Yeah, so I'm super excited about this.",
    "Uh, let's just hope there's no more technical difficulties 'cause I will throw my mouse.",
    "OK, let's see what we can do.",
    "We want to take this.",
    "Don't really need a solid color for this one.",
    "Turn the path.",
    "How do we do this?",
    "I'm going to open a older project up to see how I did this.",
    "Actually going to try something very experimental real quick, so we're going to turn this shadow on.",
    "I'm going to duplicate this circle.",
    "I want to mask them.",
    "What happened?",
    "D we got 2.",
    "Control ship them when I'm not working, but should be.",
    "Mask wears the mask option.",
    "Let's ungroup first.",
    "If I do this.",
    "They should have that.",
    "Let's try this then.",
    "I had a student do something super super super, super cool.",
    "Let's see shared with me and we're just going to copy it where I want to see what she did.",
    "I had no idea how she did this.",
    "Let's see.",
    "Nila, I'm actually not live on YouTube because there's just so much technical difficulty between like be hands in YouTube.",
    "Even when I do like I probably could do it on YouTube solo.",
    "But I really want to get in on be hands because the things that are in the runway.",
    "Are going to be super cool for this platform.",
    "However, now let's take this real quick.",
    "Going to learn from this.",
    "Wanna take that?",
    "Please put it back.",
    "Close that up.",
    "Cool that in and we will figure out how we go.",
    "Our friend made this so why I want to do this is she made a really cool.",
    "She made it so that this little circle had shadows within it, so I want to see what she did.",
    "Oh OK, so this is what it looks like.",
    "So she has ticket look at the.",
    "Layers here, so she has this exclusion thing.",
    "Let's take a look at this.",
    "Let's turn this off.",
    "What is this?",
    "Right, that's the whole thing.",
    "So I pulled this off.",
    "And that's what she does.",
    "OK, OK, so we could do this, which intersects them.",
    "This does the inverse.",
    "So what I want to do is I have this when I duplicate this, make that one little bit smaller going to intersect them.",
    "Turn the shadow on.",
    "Turn these borders off OK.",
    "So I kind of want that, but like on the edge.",
    "Not entirely sure.",
    "I think what I'm just going to do is, I mean duplicate this.",
    "Well, I'm glad you were able to make it to be hands nila.",
    "Thank you so much for joining us.",
    "And Yeah, the be I mean guys be Hans is an amazing platform.",
    "I just gotta figure out 'cause there's certain things that like.",
    "For example, I think they have troubles running.",
    "Certain resolutions, like for example my video right now if we go back to here it's 4K, but I'm porting 4K into 19, nineteen 20 by 1080.",
    "So I think that's what might be the issue there.",
    "So I just got to talk to him and figure that out alright, so let's do this.",
    "We do our shadows that are white.",
    "Turn the blur all the way down to zero 'cause we want.",
    "Just like a little.",
    "Like a little shadow thing like that, so I'm going to rotate it just a little bit.",
    "Not the not that.",
    "Go up one.",
    "Go to the side a little bit.",
    "There we go.",
    "And.",
    "This is a little bit of a blur, So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to.",
    "Go into the Shadow and turn the opacity down a little bit.",
    "There you go.",
    "I think we can do a little bit more, but I think that works that had that gives us a little bit of that shape, and so we're going to do that with all these other buttons down here.",
    "All right?",
    "Sing",
    "Let us start with this was to these buttons first were just do the same thing.",
    "We're going to go to.",
    "Linear gradient.",
    "We're going to go light and get this in the middle.",
    "Medium black Darkest black I'm going to do is going to angle that here here.",
    "And now I want to just make this a component to go control K.",
    "And I'm just going to duplicate these.",
    "To these other spots that I had.",
    "Delete all this and make sure the spacing between everything is a OK Paragon.",
    "Alright, so now all we gotta do is we gotta do something to make another point here.",
    "Going to pull this out.",
    "Make that this color.",
    "Halfway through.",
    "Make this a little darker.",
    "This thing out here just push it over to saturate some saturate.",
    "I wanted to look like it has a little bit of a reflective edge kinda, so we got something there, but we also want to let's go to shadow.",
    "Now it has somewhat of a like a glow happening, so we're going to try to figure this out.",
    "When I go into the shadow, we're going to hear.",
    "And we're going to do two of these.",
    "So we have this one button with the shadow.",
    "I'm going to duplicate it here.",
    "I'm gonna take this shot.",
    "I'm going to make it blue this time.",
    "Push it up in this way.",
    "And I'm going to turn the opacity down so it's not that crazy.",
    "Same thing here, and go to the shot on the turn.",
    "This down just a little bit.",
    "Turn it down just a little bit.",
    "And I'm going to do one more.",
    "I'm gonna do one more duplicate that.",
    "Let's just test something I'm going to take this shadow all the way down to zero.",
    "I'm going to bring this in.",
    "It's a little bit I'm going to see if I can do a highlight.",
    "And you'll see this here.",
    "I want to just small highlighting to see if I can get this to negative one negative one go here.",
    "Bring this to white.",
    "I'm gonna turn the pasta the Just Smidge.",
    "Bring that more here.",
    "There we go.",
    "So we have that nice like crisp edge.",
    "So basically what I did to create that and I think what I want to do here in this Phil's going to make this portion the center just a little bit darker.",
    "Like that, a tad darker as well.",
    "We're going to go back in.",
    "We're going to just make it that color that color.",
    "Let's see, we try to stretch this out.",
    "Cool.",
    "Almost almost.",
    "Still not happy with that, maybe this just needs to be a little bit closer color.",
    "Best closer.",
    "That's about there.",
    "Try to.",
    "Make this a little bit.",
    "I think I might be adding too many colours now.",
    "Let's see what happens if I pull this out.",
    "Trying to do this.",
    "Make this a little bit lighter.",
    "Make this that blue.",
    "Closer, closer closer, but all this is like.",
    "Finagle ING guys?",
    "Let's close it still looks a little desaturated, some ago here to this blue pump this up just a tad bit.",
    "And I think we, I think we can pause there.",
    "And I'm just going to group all these rectangles blue, but.",
    "Cool, I'm going to ask for more time in the chat.",
    "How are we going?",
    "As you guys smell anymore technical difficulties, looks like my video.",
    "OK man, I thought my video.",
    "Paused again, I would be like.",
    "Who God?",
    "Alright cool, So what we got here?",
    "I'm a deep in going to go back here and just groups of this stuff just so I.",
    "Menu button cool.",
    "Nagauta this darker part here I'm going to scale the blur of this just a little bit.",
    "You guys can see here I'm trying to scale this shadow just a little bit.",
    "Dark images a little bit scaled up so little, bit more so it spreads.",
    "Might be a little too dark.",
    "It's popping out too much, so we're going to go back in.",
    "Go back, just turn that shadow just a little bit down.",
    "There we go.",
    "We don't want to pop into hard, OK?",
    "So now we're going to put are going to go to our main component here.",
    "Wanted to put a shadow on this.",
    "This will put a shadow on everything else.",
    "Or at least the other.",
    "Components that we have of it.",
    "So we're going to angle it just a little bit.",
    "We're going to have things the shadow come down at like a 45 directly, 45 degree angle, and we're going to blur this out just a little.",
    "Bit cool.",
    "We're getting somewhere ladies and gents.",
    "We are getting somewhere.",
    "So let's try.",
    "Now we're going to basically apply what we have here to this shape here, and I think we can easily do that by going to keep this shape, but I'm going to try something.",
    "I'm going to copy this shape here.",
    "I'm going to UN.",
    "boy gotta do we gotta ungroup the component and we're going to actually want to bring this shape.",
    "Bring the shape bank bringing back.",
    "Oh wait OK bring it back 'cause they need to trace it right quick slide everything up.",
    "Bring this nice thing up to the top and what I'm going to do is I'm gonna double click it.",
    "And I'm a just scratch AKA stretch, stretch everything, so we're going OK.",
    "Let's do this collectively.",
    "Let me just select all this.",
    "Bring this down.",
    "Cool, unselect these, i'ma bring it, these.",
    "Now over holding shift.",
    "Why do all this?",
    "Cool, now I'm just going to hold this.",
    "And just pull that up.",
    "So Donna.",
    "Very nice, cool so we didn't have to recreate anything we had.",
    "We got a nice little piece here.",
    "This seems it would be like a little funky thing happening here.",
    "I don't know with all that, but about there's like a hard corner.",
    "OK, what just happened one from busted to even more?",
    "OK, I'm going to right click this.",
    "Where are the anchor points?",
    "Where are the anchor point?",
    "Usually when you click like Alt.",
    "Let's just do this.",
    "Let me just pull this in now.",
    "Control Z.",
    "Where are the anchor points?",
    "With this you should be able to hold alt and then just come up OK.",
    "There you go, so I'm holding out now pulling that in.",
    "And all I did for to show up as I just I just double click the circles.",
    "See now that doesn't have that bump.",
    "I wanted.",
    "Nice and smooth.",
    "Cool alright, so fix that problem now is going to pull this back.",
    "Take out that way.",
    "Now these guys can see that this has a larger shadow, So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go back into our shadows here, turn up the blur a little bit more and bring it more to down on the Y and push it more out on the X here and blurred out just a little bit more.",
    "There we go.",
    "Duplicate that.",
    "Cool, so there we are.",
    "Bring these up just a little bit.",
    "Thank you guys.",
    "Thank you and esco.",
    "Thank you for curate.",
    "Thank you Miguel.",
    "Yeah, so this is a lot to learn, but that's why it's like important to like.",
    "This is why I do this.",
    "Like all of my colors of front, lay them out and I'm like, OK, well, let's just add this to the Swatch is let's make sure we.",
    "Make as much reusable stuff as possible.",
    "Let me see what we got now we gotta make this little thing at the bottom.",
    "So we're just going to pull actually know what I said that right after I will try to do this.",
    "By Ungrouping, we're going to take another component.",
    "We're going to pull that out.",
    "We're going to keep.",
    "Let's do this really quick as well.",
    "Let's kind of figure out.",
    "So we have 30 pixels on the side here, and we have 47.",
    "So what I'm going to do is I'm going to select all these, just pull them out just a little bit until I have like 30 pixels on each side.",
    "So what I'm going to do here?",
    "Someone push this in by one so 30 here and we have 30 here.",
    "But there's like spacing differences now in between we have 1616 and 15.",
    "So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna select all these and just hit this readjustment, playing that distributes things.",
    "Evenly horizontally, so let's see what it does.",
    "1615.",
    "Sixteen are what I could technically do is make these things smaller, but this is fine.",
    "So what I'm going to do next?",
    "This portion.",
    "So what I want to do is these guys can see there's a nice little glowing edge here, so will make that and there's a a dark edge here, so I'm going to duplicate this.",
    "I'm going to make a shadow, but I'm going to make it white and you guys will see what I'll do first, so I'm going to bring this up.",
    "And to the left here, and I'm turned down the blur all the way to one or two.",
    "Zero rather want to do the same thing here, negative one negative one.",
    "So you got that nice little round edge you guys see just like that that that crisp edge you feel me.",
    "So we're going to do the same thing the other side of kinda already has that if we really wanted to, we could increase the shadow just a little bit.",
    "And blurred out just a little bit more, but we're going to put this back on top.",
    "And if we if we really wanted to, if it was too because it is really sharp right now, what we could do is duplicate it.",
    "Take the this line underneath.",
    "And blur this out just a little bit.",
    "On the increase.",
    "It on the Y axis and on the negative X axis bring this back.",
    "Now it's harsh, but it has a little bit of a glow.",
    "So what I'm going to do is going to go back to that second rectangle and then go back to his shadow.",
    "That turned this down just a tad.",
    "And I'm going to go back to this and turn down that hard edges a little bit.",
    "So now we have a nice glow, but also that hard edge at the same time.",
    "Pretty close.",
    "Let me turn that hard edge up.",
    "Just just a little bit.",
    "Very cool.",
    "So now we are.",
    "What are we going to do?",
    "Still think that the shadow is really, really really strong, so I'm going to go back into here.",
    "I'm going to go back into this shadow.",
    "I'm going to actually grab.",
    "That color that we had in the Swatch.",
    "So it's the same color as the background, so it blends in just a little bit.",
    "And I'm going to just darkness slowly here.",
    "I think it's good.",
    "So we have a little bit of edge, but it's not too much.",
    "I think that works, and I'm also going to do so.",
    "We only have if you guys looking at my color panel or my What is this layer palette through something?",
    "The top one I really should have three so this is our highlight.",
    "This is our shadow I'm going to duplicate this and make the center one.",
    "In the blur out.",
    "When they bring it a little bit more to the left.",
    "And a little bit more.",
    "Up so I have negative two and negative two in the Y&X Axis, so we have that nice blur.",
    "'cause before this is what we would have had just like that where you just have the hard edge.",
    "We're adding this back in and now it kind of looks glowy, and we're going to blow it out just a little bit, and we're going to turn down the Opacity on that hard edge so it doesn't look too rough.",
    "So we're going to hear shadow drop that Opacity just a little bit.",
    "There we go back to our shadowing to blurred this.",
    "We're going to bring this more so to the left.",
    "Up We're also going to change this color too.",
    "We wanted to be like that dark grey that we had in our color palette so it blends in a little bit more.",
    "Let's see what that looks like.",
    "There we go that looks a little bit more blurred.",
    "Blended in so now we're going to go back to our shadow.",
    "Dark in that up.",
    "There we go.",
    "Now looks a lot softer.",
    "Yeah, how you guys feeling on that one?",
    "Darker 2.",
    "Actually, I'm just going to use this.",
    "I think that's safe, cool, so now it's softer, so that's kind of how you have to layer some certain things to get like that feel.",
    "But yeah, I dig it.",
    "OK.",
    "So now let us.",
    "This is actually I'm going to turn this opacity down for whatever reason.",
    "It doesn't look like there's a button there.",
    "It looks like there's three buttons, and then this odd thing so.",
    "And I'm going to turn this opacity down.",
    "And now we're almost to the point of getting icons.",
    "I just want to make this last thing 'cause it is no more fick and then we'll get into the nitty gritty of how you get PS4 stuff and all that.",
    "Good all that goodness.",
    "Uhm, but how you guys feeling?",
    "That said, you guys been awfully quiet.",
    "I really appreciate you.",
    "You guys are like you like family.",
    "Y'all were like Oh my God, Brandy got shut down.",
    "We gotta go find the other video so we can see what my man's is doing.",
    "Um, so I really do appreciate that.",
    "Even though we were on a very good track record, the first like 15 minutes and then be hands was like the world does not need to know all this cancel.",
    "No, I don't even think it was be hands.",
    "I think it was probably my settings 'cause I'm trying a lot of new stuff out here and I probably overloaded.",
    "Something, so it's more likely the case.",
    "Let's see.",
    "So what were we doing?",
    "Yes, creating this button.",
    "So we're going to just go up in here.",
    "Little trace this jump.",
    "Power turn off their border.",
    "Very cool, now I'm going to.",
    "Let's see 'cause they actually do something.",
    "A lot interesting here.",
    "There's like a little indent.",
    "I'm really curious how we can make that.",
    "I think we're going to do this in a 3A Street.",
    "The three step process, so this will be a button.",
    "This will be a button and then they'll be underneath button.",
    "So let's try.",
    "We are going to.",
    "Grab this.",
    "Wait, hold up blue button rectangle or going to shadow real quick.",
    "'cause I think I want to use this.",
    "We're going to take this.",
    "And again.",
    "This is why reusing things are absolutely excellent.",
    "When I'm going to do is turn down.",
    "The radius of all these however you guys here I did that I just grabbed all the rectangles here.",
    "Just changed.",
    "The radius, what is the radius on this five?",
    "Where does the reading of Sony's five cool good?",
    "So let's start off with this.",
    "I'm going to take this first rectangle.",
    "I'm going to put this Y to 0.",
    "'cause as you guys can see, it looks like the highlight is over here at this time I'm going to go in this gradient from the move stuff around.",
    "Move this here.",
    "Now what I'm going to do?",
    "Duplicate this in the move this.",
    "Here.",
    "I don't think we'll see.",
    "We'll see where we're testing this works.",
    "Actually delete that.",
    "We're going to take this and copy paste this here, take.",
    "These portions.",
    "How?",
    "Pull this out.",
    "Hum.",
    "No, let's see.",
    "I think we can just do it in two pieces.",
    "I'm glad already checked.",
    "Thank you so much for joining us.",
    "I'm glad you're learning some good and amazing things.",
    "I'm glad I could be be here for you.",
    "Are we be here for you and uh?",
    "Learn some things together.",
    "Alright, I'm going to try this.",
    "Not sure how this is gonna workout.",
    "We are going to do fill.",
    "We're going to do linear.",
    "Hey thank you so much for.",
    "Thank you Randy.",
    "Even though we're not on YouTube right now, thank you so much for subscribe for subscribing.",
    "I really gotta figure out how to do the cross YouTube and be hand live situation because that would be ideal at best.",
    "I'm going to try to do this horizontal, so we got that dark thing there.",
    "We're going to do this here.",
    "Actually, let's see, I'm going to do that dark thing there.",
    "Pull that out just a little bit.",
    "And so we got that blue.",
    "I got that part or wait.",
    "Blue select this purple.",
    "OK, so now I'm going to pull.",
    "Let's see what can we do?",
    "So now we kind of have that.",
    "But it's not the right color.",
    "So what I'm going to do very quickly is going to get this watch.",
    "I'm going to grab.",
    "This color here this blue and turn that border off real quick so I'm going to go back into here.",
    "And then go back to this.",
    "Oh, forgot to do this real quick.",
    "Add that color.",
    "Now when I'm here to go to the gradient, I'm going to select this color.",
    "There we go that looks a little bit better.",
    "So now what I can do is I can extend this.",
    "It's a little bit, so now it looks.",
    "What we have is we have one piece down here and we just have this other piece.",
    "This other rectangle on top.",
    "Let's see actually gonna go to technical issues, not just with you.",
    "I saw in other streams and getting the hands team already know.",
    "That gives me a lot of like faith.",
    "But it really does because I think this platform is really awesome because everybody that uses an Adobe product gets a notification when their favorite streamer, our favorite artist goes live, and I think it's a great way for the community.",
    "To grow organically.",
    "So.",
    "I'm thank you for that information.",
    "I'll double check to when I talk to the peeps this week.",
    "OK, we have our button basically going to scale this down real quick.",
    "Cool.",
    "So I'm just going to going to copy that.",
    "Pull it over here.",
    "Not entirely sure.",
    "Let's see.",
    "So this I'm going to just make like a quick box just so I can check the distance between.",
    "So this is like 17 pixels.",
    "Let's see 1818 fine whatever.",
    "Cool, so we got that.",
    "Now it's time to.",
    "Get some writing at home.",
    "You know it's really weird guys.",
    "I noticed that as I get Super Intense I like start biting the sides of my cheese.",
    "Like Like that, I find that really interesting, so I'm going to use a little bit different typography too.",
    "I don't like going to light.",
    "See what happens then.",
    "It really didn't change it all it did not.",
    "So we're just going to do, let's see, let's see.",
    "Let's see.",
    "Let's see what other.",
    "When does sans font?",
    "This is new open sounds right now.",

    "Looks a little weird.",
    "Not entirely sure if I dig it.",
    "Let's see if I can.",
    "Now we're going to leave that there for right now I'm going to move this over just a tad bit, 'cause for some reason it's bothering me.",
    "I don't know why.",
    "OK, so we have our home want to increase the size of this just in time.",
    "15 12 1314 that's good enough right now what I'm going to do is I'm going to go back to my layers panel going to take this rectangle with this blue button, go to the bottom most button and I'm going to go ahead.",
    "And.",

    "That's what it should be called Taco truck font.",
    "OK, cool, let's see.",
    "So now we're going to go ahead and we're going to go back to our icons or plugins rather.",
    "To profile, hold on.",
    "OK or person?",

    "I got an extreme urge to sing like Dora the Explorer right there.",
    "I have no idea why.",
    "OK, so we have our main 3 icons 123.",
    "We're going to pull that onto our art board and we just gon make them light.",
    "Alright you feel me?",
    "Now we're going to just bring it this down and you know what?",
    "Yes, we are there.",
    "We are happening.",
    "Fire delicious.",
    "OK.",
    "Cool, so we got that.",
    "Who is the sender?",
    "These puppies out and we're just going to bring opacity down by like 40% by just hitting #4.",
    "Right, so now let's check.",
    "So we have 17 pixels from the side to the button and we kind of want to check this out.",
    "This meeting sick like Loki, gives me an art survives.",
    "I'm not sure if you guys are like getting that, but it's like no.",
    "I'm saying I'm like almost there, it's happening.",
    "You know what I mean?",
    "OK, so I think.",
    "Select all these.",
    "Pull these out this way.",
    "18 on the move.",
    "All these out just by one so that you have 17.",
    "Also, as always, I'm just going to cross compare.",
    "I'm going to take these and just pull them over.",
    "I held out by the way so I can duplicate them.",
    "I want to see the size.",
    "Of these things in the space thing, so I got this at this very cool.",
    "Copying is not wrong.",
    "Ladies and gentlemen, it is just trying to find the most correct answer and using that information for yourself.",
    "This is true, all right?",
    "So we got 17 here.",
    "Alright just seems about right.",
    "This does seem a bit close.",
    "Let me see this check this.",
    "Holding all coming in here trying to check with the button going to scale this down just a little bit.",
    "Alright, so now I'm going to copy all this.",
    "Now that I have the correct or what it seems to be the correct size delete that bring the thin Hallelujah you feel me, OK?",
    "Nothing is well, right?",
    "This seems like were there were happening, it's happening guys.",
    "Still not entirely sure how I feel about this icon, but.",
    "Scanner.",
    "Bergenfield with that OK.",
    "So we got some more icons in there.",
    "Going to get a menu icon really quick.",
    "One of those strange odd ones, so I'm just going to click in here.",
    "Grab this.",
    "Pull that in.",
    "And before I do that, I'm actually just going to like I said, copying is the best way to figure out how to make something, so we're going to see scale this down.",
    "See the actual sizing.",
    "Pull this in.",
    "Alright cool.",
    "Select that, pull that in.",
    "Black, you'll feel it.",

    "I'm gonna go in here really quick 'cause I see that this that this that oh this shadow is pretty thick.",
    "Some of the ticket make it a little thick.",
    "I'm going to blur it out just a little bit less.",
    "Move it across the X axis a little more.",
    "Turn it down.",
    "Alright, so.",
    "Another thing I notice is that there's a little bit of shine here too.",
    "To give it that nice crisp edge.",
    "So I think we're going to have to do the same thing that we did with these other other sections I'm going.",
    "I just duplicated, i'mma turn off the shadow here, or actually we want it on one at white.",
    "We're going to turn down this blur all the way down to 0.",
    "We're going to do.",
    "Everything in the negative.",
    "So when do negative 5.",
    "I want negative one negative one and negative one.",
    "Perfect.",
    "Go back in here.",
    "I'm going to turn the Opacity just a little bit.",
    "More down or another way, like if you see this weird thing happening here, what you literally could do is you can turn the opacity all the way up.",
    "And you can try to match.",
    "Like I really like color.",
    "That still looks like a, uh.",
    "How do you say?",
    "Like a shiny.",
    "Like a shiny thing, so let's go back home shadows keep it light.",
    "Yeah, and then we can start playing with the opacity there.",
    "There you go.",
    "So now we got that hard edge perfect and delete that and duplicate this.",
    "Turn Opacity down on this just a little bit.",
    "Cool for looking good ladies and gents, we I'm feeling pretty good put plus one in the chat.",
    "If you are feeling fire or thumbs up one of the others.",
    "OK, I'm still not liking this home thing.",
    "It really bothers me.",
    "It looks funky.",
    "Turn it down just a little bit.",
    "2121 This way.",
    "Alright, that looks a little bit better in my eyes now.",
    "This kind of let's get some of these words in here and then we're going to go find a PS4 asset.",
    "So we have dual.",
    "Sense.",
    "Duplicate that holding, oh.",
    "Blue and black.",
    "Version.",
    "Side that down.",

    "This video is sponsored by popping fonts.",
    "See what happens.",
    "Boom OK, so kind of got this going.",
    "Cool, let's now let us go get these.",
    "What is this?",
    "A controller, alright?",
    "Let's do it.",
    "Let's do PS5.",
    "Controller Perfect.",
    "Lily, all we're going to do is cut some of these miss out.",
    "So we got going to open this in new tab.",
    "And you guys must be like Super Super Super Super.",
    "This is one of the things that I had to.",
    "Go in and check.",
    "Is because my the chat literally what I did like 60 seconds ago.",
    "You guys are seeing this.",
    "Makes it challenging to like.",
    "Interact with you guys.",
    "So I got to kind of figure out.",
    "Um?",
    "How to?",
    "Do that as well.",
    "Alright, so I'm going to try to grab like a dark PS five controller.",
    "Let's see, we are on the Google Ace.",
    "See.",
    "There we go.",
    "It's close enough.",
    "So what I'm going to do?",
    "Is.",
    "And take this.",
    "Copy image, open up my.",
    "Will just put both of these.",
    "What is this?",
    "Go back, go back, return to sender will open this up copy image.",
    "Place these babies in our doe BXT if you know what I'm saying, right, OK?",
    "Select OK, so we're done.",
    "All right, So what I'm going to do is I'm going to hit, let's see, let's see how they did this.",
    "They just cut it all out.",
    "Alright, cool, I'm going to go edit in photo shop.",
    "Wait for that.",
    "Hope that puppy that open the mall.",
    "We're going to do is we're going to hit.",
    "W.",
    "And we are just going to do hold up.",
    "That's not it.",
    "We're going to do a marquee tool which is M.",
    "We're going to select this.",
    "We're going to go to select and mask.",
    "Select subject.",
    "Yes, please.",
    "And it should sweet select everything that we need here.",
    "So we're going to.",
    "Take all this.",
    "I think that Holder.",
    "Oh The kind of like erased out some of the controller, but that's fine.",
    "We're just going to say this.",
    "When do the same thing with this other one edit in Photoshop?",
    "Get a marquee tool.",
    "Literally select this entire thing.",
    "'cause photo shop is literally a G.",
    "Now 'cause you don't need to do your own selections anymore, select.",
    "Selected mask select subject OK.",
    "Phone there you go, just hit OK.",
    "I'm going to do.",
    "Apply mask.",
    "Save and perfect.",
    "We have two nice PNG's that we can drag onto our art board now.",
    "You know it would be better.",
    "Let's use the white one 'cause there's more contrast in that one to begin with.",
    "There there we go.",
    "That looks more interesting, but what I would like to do is I want to kind of go back in here.",
    "I'm going to edit in photo shop real quick.",
    "I want to going to duplicate this too, just in case if I mess up.",
    "'cause?",
    "I want to paint in.",
    "These little handles that it had.",
    "I don't want to lose that.",
    "Whoops, what just happened.",
    "Making calls now.",
    "Fluffy comeback in groups.",
    "Opposites are going to come in here.",
    "Shape this up just a little bit.",
    "Only reason that Adobe kind of like grabbed his edge is because it's so close to the background color with the shadow.",
    "So I'm just adding it back in.",
    "And also at a very strange curiosity, who here in the chat listens to.",
    "ASM are.",
    "'cause like yo whoever comes out with like doing live stream of this stuff and does ASM are.",
    "I would be very interested in watching something like that.",
    "I would definitely be the wrong person to do.",
    "ASM are because I just I'm loud, I can.",
    "I wasn't born to do those type of things.",
    "It just wasn't alright cool, so I think that's good enough.",
    "Let's see.",
    "Watch when we say it's going to be like it's busted.",
    "Still have some funky in there?",
    "Let's see if we can be doing to black background behind everything.",
    "Not a white one.",
    "Black one so I can see my mistakes.",
    "'cause there's a lot of him clean it up.",
    "Clean this up.",
    "And for those of you guys who are wondering how I'm doing this.",
    "I'm using a mask.",
    "I think that's I think that's alright.",
    "My hands are sweating.",
    "Trying to get this like perfectly will be outta here with like Oh God like that's how I cut things out.",
    "I would say it is real close.",
    "And what time we gonna go over woman time.",
    "Alright, close enough, we just got hit CTRL S.",
    "We're going to call today.",
    "Um now today.",
    "You know people who do this for a living shout out to y'all 'cause This Is.",
    "This is extreme.",
    "You gotta be.",
    "You can't breathe when you do this.",
    "You gotta be like.",
    "And get the lines let you know.",
    "Connected and all that alright, so I'm going to select this, make selection to the man and not that one the other one.",
    "OK, there we go.",
    "We're going to do that to this side as well foam foam.",
    "Oh my God.",
    "This.",
    "Pull that out.",
    "Tablet blau boom like that, select.",
    "This is what I should have done from the beginning.",
    "I was trying to be cute and I'll be like look at this new feature which works excellent in certain ones, but obviously this was very close to the background.",
    "The black one came out very nice.",
    "So in the save that take out this background, save cool.",
    "Nicely done ladies and gents.",
    "Hum OK, cool.",
    "So we have this.",
    "Just chilling now.",
    "We we is going to do what we're probably finna do, ladies and gentlemen.",
    "Bring this.",
    "Down just a tad.",
    "It's like there and bring this up in the passage is a little bit.",
    "Acute is tomorrow makes me uncomfortable yo, I feel you I.",
    "I think there's like a level of uncomfortable iti that we have to have in our lives.",
    "Though I don't know, I've been really there's like this one person who's been like eating like Slime Gems and for whatever reasons it has like salt or whatever like crunchy stuff in it and I'm like it makes me feel a certain way however.",
    "I love to watch people paint and do a.",
    "Some are just like slow, methodical things I really enjoy.",
    "I don't.",
    "I don't know why.",
    "OK, So what we're going to do really quick is going to add a shadow to this as well.",
    "We're going to blur the South lot.",
    "Turn this up just a little bit.",
    "And I'm going to add it to be the color that we use, like Swatch is.",
    "That's another thing, like when you're trying to pick colors and what not.",
    "It's a very nice too.",
    "Like pick all around the same colors like.",
    "Instead of having the shadows of these elements be straight black, there a variation of this background black, so I would go in here pick that's watch and then just make it a tad darker rather than just going straight to black.",
    "So it's all in like a complementary spectrum.",
    "OK.",
    "So looks like we are we're doing pretty good.",
    "It's really interesting to me is that there's this like outer shadow that's like casting shadow inside.",
    "The application, which is really odd.",
    "We might try to do that.",
    "I think that would be super super super super interesting.",
    "So what I'm going to try to do?",
    "Do this duplicate bringing this in.",
    "Bring this in by a little bit, but wait, hold it.",
    "Bring this in by a little bit like.",
    "15 bring this in by like 15.",
    "Cool and.",
    "Try this.",
    "Shadow",
    "OK so we got.",
    "Dark in this up and what I'm doing is I'm trying to get the shadow inside of this.",
    "And you guys will see it on about it.",
    "Do in a second.",
    "So boom, boom going to hit this color.",
    "Just a little bit, and now what I'm going to do now that we have like that outer shadow.",
    "What I'm going to do is I'm going to pull this white edge outside of our art board.",
    "So we don't see anything turn the border off too so we don't see anything but that internal shadow casted on everything.",
    "And guys to think that this this is the thing my student taught me how to do this like never.",
    "I'm a martial artist, so I call it.",
    "I keep the white belt mentality, no matter how good you get, no matter how much notoriety or an experience you have.",
    "Like always be sure to listen to other perspectives, because like I said before, we have strengths and weaknesses in my yard.",
    "You can already tell like what my strengths and weaknesses.",
    "I just know to practice a lot in order to make myself good at something that's the only thing that has ever really.",
    "Help me Excel, whereas other people like we had in here earlier we had Leona Uhm who I look up to because she's just like incredibly smart is able to like, deconstruct very complex information and even talk about complex information.",
    "I always have to like do the reverse side to have a very hard time understanding complex.",
    "Things so when I tried to learn I still learn about it, but what I try to do then is when I learn it.",
    "I really try to bring it back down to simpler terms.",
    "So not only I can explain it to somebody else, but so the person I'm explaining it to can pick it up easier because they not they don't have to go and learn the complicated thing to understand it.",
    "They literally can take the fundamentals in elements that I broke down for them in understanding that way so.",
    "Anyway, I don't know why I was talking about listening.",
    "Oh, because my student taught me how to do this.",
    "So yeah, I don't know everything under the sun.",
    "I just know I do two things.",
    "Well, I know how to find information, study it, and applied.",
    "OK, let's see.",
    "Let us get this.",
    "Other controller into play.",
    "And bring it in here.",
    "Let's see what is the opacity to this 3535 perfect.",
    "Excellent.",
    "Alright, what else?",
    "We got my music stop playing.",
    "The whole thing over again.",
    "So now what I want to do is, I still think we need like a little bit more glow.",
    "Um, from this button we still need like a gradient in the background.",
    "So what I'm doing here I'm going to go to for more solid color.",
    "We're going to set up our gradient here, so we're going to do is we're going to apply everything just like we did in these buttons.",
    "We're going to go back to our Swatch is.",
    "We're going to light.",
    "Middle.",
    "Dark ale.",
    "OK, cool, so now we have a little bit of a gradient happening.",
    "Uhm, I also want to.",
    "I want to make sure that this shadow is casting.",
    "OK, cool.",
    "Boom, so I'm going to go in again.",
    "I'm going to try to use one of these.",
    "Darker colors that we've already used.",
    "Turn down opacity a little bit.",
    "It's getting a little too intense in this blue here.",
    "There we go.",
    "Guys didn't even know I could do this.",
    "I was so scared to do this.",
    "Uh, let's call it.",
    "I was so scared to do this this live.",
    "I was like man we gotta do alive of something I've never even done before.",
    "We literally just about to open up the pod or another podcast but the the What is this a live stream and figure it out from there.",
    "'cause I was like man, they're going to roast me if I open up like alive tutorial.",
    "Teach them how to do, but I don't know, um, but you know, is learning in progress for me too.",
    "I don't always had to teach.",
    "We learn together alright, so let's see, let's just see.",
    "I do want little bit more dark here so I'm just add another anchor point here and made a little bit darker in this section here.",
    "I'm going to do the same thing in this.",
    "Make this a little bit darker.",
    "Move this up.",
    "Just hope so I don't need four or five of them here, perfect.",
    "Okie Dokes Um?",
    "What I'm actually going to do delete that I'm going to make?",
    "123 I cannot select this last very cool control K make this whole thing a component.",
    "Oh There's one more thing.",
    "Well, in one more thing, Jackie.",
    "How do I get to my layers?",

    "I still feel little funky about this background.",
    "Uhm, it's way too light up here so I'm just bring this guide up here.",

    "Entirely sure, that's the best icon in my go.",
    "For something else.",
    "A little bit later.",
    "But we're just gonna leave that there for right now.",
    "I'm going to go back to flat icon really quick.",
    "I'm going to get a menu icon, something that's a little bit closer to what we want here.",
    "Or maybe it's settings settings?",
    "This is close.",

    "Plow.",
    "Scalebound is a little bit.",
    "Select Still show that is slightly a button there I don't.",
    "I don't understand why there's like no button right there, so not entirely sure the meaning of that.",
    "OK, next I'm going to get R Nintendo switch icon, duplicate that here scaled down.",
    "To get the correct will get the correct sizing of all the.",
    "Icons and a bit so that now we have our ghetto mouse.",

    "To this shadow here.",
    "Brighten it up the bottom shadow.",
    "There you go.",
    "And if we really wanted to wanted like a nice glow over top everything, what I could do is I could make an ellipse.",
    "Right over top of the button.",
    "Change this to that purple color.",
    "Go to blur objects, blur that baby.",
    "There we go.",
    "Now we have like a nice blur over top of it.",
    "However, if you really wanted to, you can also change the opacity of that that glow.",
    "As well.",
    "Perfect.",
    "Oh my God.",
    "Then I had to screenshot this.",
    "Hold on guys, I'm just double checking to see if I'm still alive.",
    "'cause it looks like I might not be.",
    "And I do not want to refresh the page because that means everybody's going to get kicked off and I had to restart again.",
    "So putting the comment or in the chat section is everything good.",
    "Can you guys still see stuff?",
    "Because on my side I'm saying there's a problem playing this video, so let me know.",
    "Perfect so.",
    "It is double checking here hold on guys.",
    "Wanna make sure?",
    "OK, so I guess you guys can see.",
    "OK, it looks like it's still working.",
    "It looks like it's still working.",
    "Ha ha ha.",
    "I was getting a heart attack guys OK.",
    "So now what we can do is we can start actually prototyping.",
    "We have our main foundation.",
    "Employ everything aside, so it took two hours to get one screen.",
    "Very nice, but we were learning uhm and basically all we all we have to do now.",
    "To get some of this stuff under way is actually let's check out.",
    "What is checkout going back to?",
    "See.",
    "So you can swipe.",
    "And then you can pull that.",
    "Alright cool, let's try it let's see what we can get.",
    "So First things first, we want to do.",
    "Quick swipe, so we're going to do, and there's actually there's a new what's in the, call it.",
    "There is a new feature in Adobe XD which is.",
    "OK cool, I'm glad.",
    "Thank you guys for let me know you guys can see.",
    "Uhm, I want to see now.",
    "There should be a way.",
    "To slide.",
    "Some stuff, so I'm going to check this out very quickly.",
    "I'm seeing if this works.",
    "Is this a new new?",
    "Let's see 'cause I just hit it.",
    "Let's see fixed position when scrolling.",
    "So this is scrolling up and down.",
    "This is scrolling, I guess.",
    "Everywhere.",
    "Let's try from side to side.",
    "Not entirely sure, but this is how it's used.",
    "Let's let's let's, let's take a look at that really quick.",
    "I do want to show you guys that new feature.",
    "WXD slow.",
    "What is it called?",
    "That's the old one.",
    "Let's take a look at this really quick.",
    "Take a look at one of my Mandan skis.",
    "Dan.",
    "Not dank ski landscape.",
    "Scrolling and stacks very nice danski.",
    "Want to scroll through this real quick?",
    "Who?",
    "Group very nice.",
    "Take a look at this real quick.",
    "OK.",
    "Oh, so that's how that works.",
    "So I would select all this stuff.",
    "Fat fat",
    "That is that.",
    "This I can do stacks here, which are pretty.",
    "Pretty interesting, so it's tax do.",
    "Wanna move this out-of-the-way really quick?",
    "Take this blue button.",
    "Along with his icon.",
    "With that So what I can do here so I can take this entire group of icons?",
    "My Conroe.",
    "Bring this into icon rope.",
    "And I can shift.",
    "Things after only two stacks horizontally.",
    "Let's see if this card there we go.",
    "Very simply, reorganize and shift things around without having to move too much.",
    "Very cool.",
    "Someone just shift everything back.",
    "Perfect.",
    "OK.",
    "I'm just keep it here perfectly, still stacked.",
    "Now I want to see that secondary part.",
    "Where he does the scrolling, let's see.",
    "Come on dance key.",
    "Who's got the fruit?",
    "There we go.",
    "Oh on scroll not actually taping.",
    "OK, that's where I was messing up guys.",
    "I knew that this was the new feature.",
    "So this is how it works, so I have these two components here.",
    "I've got 1, two and so when I play this or excuse me I'm going to set this to horizontal scrolling.",
    "Going to pull this out here to the end of that card so when I play this it actually see this should be working and it's not.",
    "Kim possible.",
    "Let's go back.",
    "Let's figure out why.",
    "Turn down there.",
    "OK, so he's keeping it within the bounds.",
    "Interesting, OK?",
    "Let's do this then.",
    "Here.",
    "Play.",
    "OK.",
    "He said no work.",
    "OK, well that's just me.",
    "Then I'll figure out that on my own time and come back and let you guys know how that works, but we're not going to worry about that.",
    "What we're going to do.",
    "I'm going to ungroup.",
    "Fixed position when scrolling.",
    "I'm still kind of upset that he literally just showed that an I can't do it.",
    "Like Why?",
    "Scroll group.",
    "I wonder if it's like this?",
    "OK, that is.",
    "Horizontal.",
    "Or vertical rather OK, this is sideways, so let's see.",
    "Yeah, I don't know why it's not working.",
    "Yeah, absolutely no idea.",
    "OK, we're not gonna worry about that.",
    "We're going to undo that, and we're going to go back to our simple scrolling.",
    "So we have this grouped.",
    "An I'm going to close that duplicate this.",
    "I'm going to do is.",
    "Bring this interview.",
    "Take this turn, opacity all the way up.",
    "And.",
    "If we really wanted to, I'm going to go back even more, so I'm going to close this again.",
    "I want to duplicate this component one more time.",
    "I'm going to actually make it lighter one.",
    "This is going to drag this over.",
    "Make sure it's the same.",
    "OK, cool now and the reason why I wanted to do that ladies and gents is because when I do this I still want there to be another card so it doesn't look empty.",
    "Now want to take this all the way up to 100%.",
    "And take this, bring it down to that 35%.",
    "Cool, I only do the same thing.",
    "Back over here with this type in 35.",
    "Perfect.",
    "OK, so now what I can go ahead and do is I'm going to go to prototype.",
    "I'm going to say.",
    "Over here we're going to do a drag auto anime, easing reduce snap.",
    "Same thing we're going to.",
    "Pull this back over here.",
    "Snap perfect so this is what we should be looking like right now.",
    "The ability to pull all this cool simple stuff and you got the nice easy fading.",
    "One thing we have to do is we want to fade this out as it's pulled as well.",
    "Cool, so we're going to click in here going here.",
    "Go back to design type in 35.",
    "Perfect hit the save button.",
    "And.",
    "See.",
    "Click on it.",
    "All right, and we will do this one small portion because this next piece is going to take a little bit longer, so.",
    "Here.",
    "We're going to pool.",
    "See what happens.",
    "So this.",
    "Going a little bit further, that Opacity goes all the way down.",
    "All the way down I'm going to bring.",
    "This component up here.",
    "We're just going to 0.",
    "All of those bits out.",
    "We're going to drag this.",
    "Full across bring it up.",
    "Around here to make.",
    "Actually going to make a.",
    "Don't want to fill to be in here, that's gonna mess and stuff up when there's stuff behind it as you guys can see here, there's still dark missing.",
    "There would have picked it out.",
    "So I'm gonna click into this controller going to.",
    "Is to bring scale.",
    "Controller up Make a 5050 right about there.",
    "Center that.",
    "We're going to go and find.",
    "See.",
    "You want this featured stuff here?",
    "So, OK cool.",
    "Featured and then we have.",
    "Or not.",
    "Going to move some stuff to the side just so I can select these two.",
    "And pull them off to the side.",
    "Here zero opacity.",
    "Pull this back to the center.",
    "Have this shoot off to the side here.",
    "And let's see what changes here.",
    "So this actually.",
    "Let's go back.",
    "Dinner menu here.",
    "I wonder if we can pull that to the sign perfect zero that out.",
    "Let's see who else again.",
    "And that turns into a back arrow, so we're going to go into our plugins.",
    "Really fazed.",
    "We're going to grab Carol.",
    "Come back here, paste it in.",
    "Whoops, I want to grab that.",
    "Just grab that.",
    "Later.",
    "And we're going to copy this.",
    "Directly.",
    "Here we want to be.",
    "We want it to be in the same spot.",
    "Set the menu was or at least close to an.",
    "I'm just going to drag this out just a little bit.",
    "Drink it up.",
    "Yeah, we're going to keep it here.",
    "And we're not going to have it by that menu, So what we're going to do is, we're gonna put it here.",
    "Go back so that at least it animates in everything is going to animate out the menus goanimate out there, back buttons, goanimate pen.",
    "So we have.",
    "Dual sands  Go back to my.",
    "Hum.",
    "I want to.",
    "Kind of pulled these up.",
    "Than 0 I'm going to lock this image so I can actually get to this.",
    "Stuff below it.",
    "2 size comes over here.",
    "I'm going to pull.",
    "Smoothies.",
    "Bring them over.",
    "Two of them.",
    "Home.",
    "All right?",
    "Got some words.",
    "I'm going to go to my plugins going to go to lower map some quick lorem Epsom.",
    "That was a lot.",
    "I have no idea why, I just did that.",
    "And do that very quickly.",
    "Select Text box here.",
    "Colder insert perfect turn the size down.",
    "And we want the font to be popping.",
    "Or Poppens, whatever it is.",
    "Go back in and we're going to Kwik fill.",
    "Lorem Epsom perfect.",
    "And we're going to turn off the border.",
    "I looked a little too thick to me so.",
    "I go to light.",
    "That probably looks a little bit better.",
    "Boom boom.",
    "And.",
    "Pull this into the little bit.",
    "There you go and now we're going to have our little.",
    "Things to the side.",
    "Sing All of our different controller options, so this is going.",
    "I'm going to do very quickly.",
    "Just gonna do this.",
    "I'm gonna do.",
    "Leave release date was the other one platform.",
    "Someone to hear something to take?",
    "This I want to go to extra bold.",
    "Or let's see now we're going to do this.",
    "Take this, What is this?",
    "Panel trial.",
    "I'm going to try to group these things together platform.",
    "Yes, well.",
    "And then.",
    "Fall release date Ball One thing I kind of, do you want to do and?",
    "I'm going to try this out.",
    "I also don't want these to compete too much with this up here, so I'm going to turn it down just a little bit, so I'm going to go to now.",
    "'cause I need PS5 logo.",
    "Maybe?",
    "I'm gonna do.",
    "Summer take this copy.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Paste this in.",
    "And in photo shop.",
    "Take all that black out.",
    "Make sure it is fully white save.",
    "Come back to XD.",
    "Hey there we go.",
    "Just size this up now.",
    "Delete that pulling the PS5.",
    "Logo just like that.",
    "And now release date.",
    "What did they have from that?",
    "They just had?",
    "Whoops what what just happened there.",
    "I'm going to take this icon.",
    "Just bring it back here.",
    "For this in.",
    "There we go.",
    "That's what I'm talking bout, ladies and gentlemen, that's what right there, right there is happening.",
    "Consider this.",
    "Scale this in just a little bit too.",
    "Let's see.",
    "$50 preorder.",
    "So we're going to do here.",
    "Going to keep this same.",
    "Gonna pull these down.",
    "Zero them out.",
    "We're going to take this entire thing.",
    "Move this over.",
    "Make sure to keep the same space 17.",
    "Cool.",
    "Now we're going to do is we're going to take.",
    "$50.",
    "And we're going to use.",
    "I always forget this font name panel trial.",
    "There we go.",
    "Scale it up.",
    "Keep that in the center.",
    "This.",
    "And we are going to duplicate it.",
    "Put a number sign.",
    "And we are going to use one of our colors.",
    "Here.",
    "Looks low on, that's Why.",
    "Needs to be pre ordered.",
    "So this is where we're going to actually do something.",
    "Different we're going to.",
    "Turn Opacity on this down.",
    "Also, this is another thing that we're going to do.",
    "Going to group everything here.",
    "I'm going to see this is Group 49: the copy.",
    "Paste that onto our other artboard because we will actually run into some issues if everything is not named the same.",
    "I'm gonna push this over here.",
    "Will it take?",
    "A little icons in here.",
    "1.",
    "To start lining them up here.",
    "Reusing assets 1111.",
    "11 perfect I'm saying scale this.",
    "And now what I'm going to do is.",
    "Change these icons.",
    "And I feel like I already in going to have.",
    "Some prototype issues because I have not.",
    "It's always better to check what you're doing as you go.",
    "We have not done any of that, so I already know things going to morph into other things and it's going to be funky.",
    "What national and grab this?",
    "Trying to center it in there also try to put it in the group and to be honest I'm just going to.",
    "1111 and you guys are curious how I did that.",
    "I basically just reached a created a repeat grid, repeated it out, and then ungrouped it.",
    "Alright, now let's take it.",
    "Black controller.",
    "Raisin here 'cause that is our select one.",
    "Yeah.",
    "But OK, who OK?",
    "Now let us.",
    "Do this.",
    "Make sure that this is in our group.",
    "OK, that's in a group that's in a group, then simply perfect.",
    "I'm going to group this entire thing when I'm come over to our previous art board.",
    "Paste it, hold up.",
    "Paste it in.",
    "Push it down zero pasetti OK.",
    "Now what I'm going to do is when I click on next component, I want us to prototype.",
    "Jump over now.",
    "This might get a little messy, but this is part of the process.",
    "So.",
    "Yeah, see that's where the funkiness is.",
    "OK, So what basically is happening is I have a scroll mechanic happening as well as a click mechanic trying to happen at the same time, so I'm going to do here is.",
    "We spread these out real quick.",
    "Undo that click.",
    "Here.",
    "Tap snap.",
    "OK, let's see what happens with this.",
    "So we have our scroll when we click on this.",
    "Actually that wasn't bad.",
    "I was not bad at all.",
    "I was I was way better than I was expecting.",
    "Um, alright, so we have our back button.",
    "We're going to make sure that it goes back.",
    "We have our snap.",
    "Perfect, OK, so this is what we have.",
    "We are scrolling happening.",
    "Click in this pops into place.",
    "Now.",
    "I think we can do a little bit better in terms of the animation.",
    "It does.",
    "I mean, it does do pretty well.",
    "I would like however.",
    "Like that's that's a nice transition.",
    "I think we can do better with these icons were they literally just leave that bar if we really wanted to, we could mask this entire area to keep these icons and so for example that I could do is I could pick a rectangle here.",
    "Select these icons.",
    "Control shift M.",
    "Click inside where to go.",
    "Let me click here we go.",
    "Now I can fix the mask so.",
    "It's showing them.",
    "And I'm going to just copy this and make sure that I have it across all artboards, because again, in Adobe XD if things.",
    "Are not the same name and stuff.",
    "Things get all jacked up, so I'm going to come in here, delete these icons, paste these icons here.",
    "And what I'm going to do is I'm going to select all these and pull them down.",
    "So you'll actually will disappear within the mask.",
    "And not fall off the bar.",
    "Let's take a look at this kind of swipe click.",
    "See, there was a little fast.",
    "Couldn't really tell.",
    "No, it worked.",
    "It worked very nice, awesome and we can be a little, you know, little sneaky and do stuff like.",
    "Let's see.",
    "Where is our?",
    "Mask here we really wanted to.",
    "We could make it so that two go down, one goes up.",
    "So we can do a whole bunch of stuff and we'll just do one more screen will do one more screen.",
    "'cause it will be super simple and remove these.",
    "What I'm going to do now is I'm going to take this lighter controller.",
    "Bring it in here.",
    "I'm gonna scale it to the same size as this.",
    "Whoops Is darker controller.",
    "To an opacity down.",
    "XML and do that.",
    "I'm a copy it then.",
    "I'm going to turn opacity down.",
    "Turn it back up just to make sure.",
    "100% like lined up.",
    "OK cool.",
    "Come over here.",
    "Make sure its name the same so image 9 come back over here image not good.",
    "I'm going to take image N 10, which is the controller behind.",
    "I'm going to turn down the Opacity and I am going to transition.",
    "This group.",
    "My duplicate it and bring this.",
    "Down here.",
    "Copy and bring it over here.",
    "Now I'm going to do.",
    "Here is I'm going to change.",
    "The controller.",
    "Delete that.",
    "Bring this here.",
    "Group these two together.",
    "Excellent.",
    "Turn this 20.",
    "I'm going to turn the opacity down just a little bit so I can align this stuff up.",
    "Good.",
