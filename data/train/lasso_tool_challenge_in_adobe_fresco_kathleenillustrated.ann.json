    "What are y'all up to?",
    "I'm starting off my Sunday, nice and slow.",
    "Of course I got mighty.",
    "It's actually brewing right now.",
    "The non J what's up?",
    "If you can guess what kind of team drinking I will give you.",
    "A Gold Star.",
    "Any guesses?",
    "It is Mint, Carrot, Apple T what?",
    "Hello, sounds like something that you would forage from your backyard during Quarantine.",
    "Are in Christine.",
    "I'm so glad that my tweet.",
    "My tweet worked.",
    "It summoned you here.",
    "Hello how are you?",
    "How's your Sunday going?",
    "I'm just going to start it over here.",
    "I'm going to move my chair.",
    "It might be loud.",
    "That was loud, sorry.",
    "I'm seeing a what and I'm seeing a question mark, so I'm wondering.",
    "If you can hear me, or if you're just confused about my D.",
    "OK, good you can hear me all good thanks.",
    "Happy to be with you all.",
    "Happy to be with you too.",
    "OK so I'm gonna tackle a lasso tool landscape or as I like to call it a lasso scape.",
    "And if you weren't watching the sketch party last week, this is what that is.",
    "Basically we take a reference photo of a landscape and I recreate it with painting.",
    "But to make my painting I can only use the lasso tools and selection tools and fresco.",
    "Thank you, Aunt Christine.",
    "I can only use the lasso tools in fresco to make the shapes so you land on something really cool and kind of geometric.",
    "Almost Mary Blair Esque.",
    "So yeah, I really dig this.",
    "It was super fun to do and came together in a way that I was not expecting, so I'm excited to do that again.",
    "So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to duplicate this document and we can just use the same.",
    "Reference images Yeah, decided not to do more character design because I felt like I didn't get that much done yesterday.",
    "Might have been kind of a boring stream so I know what the lasso tool challenge will do.",
    "Something fun for the whole hour.",
    "Move my iPad.",
    "We are going to open up our new document.",
    "I'm going to delete everything scary.",
    "I'm actually just going to group everything first.",
    "And then we can delete the layers we don't need.",
    "Ticket ticket do you do?",
    "Group Group Group.",
    "Right delayed him.",
    "But my reference images in here, Nope.",
    "Delete him, then don't eat it.",
    "Here we go alright Here I reference images.",
    "Delete this one.",
    "Let me movies around you guys can help me choose which one I want to do I have an idea of which one I want to do, but I would like to hear your thoughts.",
    "Before we land on one.",
    "And there we go.",
    "OK, So what do you think about doing?",
    "Either the top right one?",
    "Or the bottom one.",
    "The top left one feels.",
    "Kind of boring to be honest.",
    "Just your normal landscape.",
    "I'm most interested in the top right.",
    "What's up?",
    "Jan, Erik.",
    "Thanks for being here.",
    "I like the top right 'cause it has those very geometric shapes already.",
    "That would be fun to make with the lasso tool, right?",
    "Well you guys give me your thoughts.",
    "I'm going to check on my tea.",
    "Who?",
    "Yeah.",
    "There's carrots and apples in there.",
    "Top right, what's up?",
    "Wayne your back.",
    "Yeah, I think top right as well.",
    "Don't tell Adobe that I'm not using Adobe stock images.",
    "Sorry Adobe.",
    "Very handy.",
    "Here also watching creativelive and editing photos in Lightroom Hatab Life Nice.",
    "That's awesome.",
    "Such an active community member.",
    "I appreciate it.",
    "All right, we're going to top right?",
    "Is my Apple pencil charged?",
    "I think so.",
    "Turn these off.",
    "There we go.",
    "I know you were wondering.",
    "Yes, koshy is here with me and yes he is still sleeping on the laundry.",
    "I haven't put away, it's his bed now.",
    "He owns it.",
    "My right or your right?",
    "You're right, which is also my right.",
    "Oh wrong one that they that one.",
    "OK, so first we need to do a little sketchy and actually This is why we changed our app settings to have the light mode.",
    "So that.",
    "But we move this off lips off the canvas.",
    "We can still see it.",
    "And Oh yeah, we have to choose a color palette.",
    "Maybe I'll just stick with the original one.",
    "Let me see if I still have my old color palettes in here.",
    "Ooh.",
    "Yeah, I might just stick with the original or bottom right?",
    "Definitely not that one that is not sparking joy right now.",
    "One of these two, perhaps well.",
    "You can't find the lasso tool.",
    "I'll show you it's just the selection tool in fresco.",
    "It acts as the polygonal lasso tool and a normal lasso tool lasso tool all in one.",
    "So if I just tap, it can drop points and be real polygonal about it.",
    "Or I can just free draw selection.",
    "And I can also switch between them seamlessly.",
    "What is that?",
    "I don't know.",
    "Haven't seen doom crossing the music video.",
    "Uh, Internal Horizons music video.",
    "No, I haven't.",
    "I know that Animal Crossing in doom exist in the same cinematic universe.",
    "Is it intense?",
    "Isabel the doomguy You better believe I already played Animal Crossing today.",
    "So first thing I do when I wake up, I gotta check in on my villagers.",
    "My favorite villager said she was going to move away and I said no, you ain't just you're staying right here.",
    "And so she staying.",
    "Alright, well.",
    "I will decide what color palette to use.",
    "After I start sketching.",
    "So let's block in some shapes.",
    "Maybe I should just make this a square?",
    "I think that would actually be pretty cool.",
    "I'll just make this.",
    "The same as the top.",
    "Oh no no no.",
    "No no no no no no.",
    "Let's do this.",
    "There we go.",
    "There we go.",
    "Done and done.",
    "Alright, let's drop in.",
    "The main shapes have got this kind of Rd.",
    "Come back here.",
    "And I will make this.",
    "Much brighter lips.",
    "And we will fill it in pixel please.",
    "Let's move it down out lips, move it down a little bit.",
    "So.",
    "Crop it.",
    "Your Apple pencil of yesterday.",
    "Still not sure about it, I find that some of the brushes you have to press very hard to get a line at all really.",
    "Are you using like the newest Apple pencil?",
    "An fresco 'cause you can change the sensitivity settings in Frisco.",
    "I have mine superlight.",
    "Now we can add in some of those lines for the field.",
    "How do you deal with the alias line?",
    "I know if I use the vector brushes it wouldn't happen.",
    "But since this is just a sketch, it's OK.",
    "And then when we actually go in with the colours, I'll be careful we won't be using the paint bucket tool, so that will keep it from doing the aliasing.",
    "Tom Nook sorry, Tim Cook.",
    "That's good.",
    "That's a real good.",
    "This time, let's say thanks much in New Horizons, too.",
    "I think he didn't do leave.",
    "I don't think he does.",
    "I haven't picked up on that, so I'm going to say no.",
    "Let's go back to our first layer for the sketch.",
    "And let's start putting in these little like hedge lines.",
    "One thing that will be helpful is the ruler tool.",
    "That's going to help me know where to drop me points.",
    "Boom Look at that.",
    "Can do the light purple.",
    "Maybe the dark purple?",
    "Are we?",
    "Yeah we are.",
    "Right?",
    "Then at this corner there's another one.",
    "Change.",
    "This one ain't perfect, but that's OK.",
    "Then they get skinnier as they go back.",
    "And a couple more.",
    "Maybe we can switch to the selection brush.",
    "All that work, I don't know if that's gonna work.",
    "OK, so there's this like I forget what the tool is called, but it's.",
    "It's like hold to snap or something like that, so check this out.",
    "I can even use it with the selection brush where I draw a straight line.",
    "It's not perfect, but if I keep my pencil press down it will snap it to a straight line and then I can.",
    "Choose what I want.",
    "That was awesome.",
    "So we can get like this.",
    "They can do it again.",
    "And they might need to even do a couple more.",
    "Can we will fill those in?",
    "Yeah.",
    "Looks cool.",
    "Beginning to like the lasso tool, trying to follow in my app on iPad.",
    "Watching on Surface Pro old one that can get Frisco.",
    "OK, so you're watching on your surface, you're playing on your iPad.",
    "That's awesome.",
    "Thanks for playing along.",
    "OK, so this sketch is pretty much done well.",
    "We need the road I guess.",
    "Jump back to the selection tool.",
    "And then it kind of disappears into the trees.",
    "They will go for this much more great out though.",
    "Already there so we can do.",
    "So I'm going to group my sketch.",
    "Well that didn't work.",
    "There we go.",
    "And then we're going to turn down the opacity of the entire sketch, and even from here I might.",
    "Move it down a little bit.",
    "And flatten it.",
    "Squish it.",
    "Maybe even rotate it a little.",
    "Get that dynamic composition going on.",
    "More diagonals please.",
    "But Good.",
    "Make a new layer and let's start this time from the background we started with the foreground last time, but.",
    "Let's switch it up.",
    "So I'm going to use my polygonal lasso tool, and I'm going to drop in the largest shape first.",
    "Some kind of just making up.",
    "Silhouette Of this tree line.",
    "And I'm just going to have it build.",
    "And fill the entire wealth.",
    "No map.",
    "And even do a shoot.",
    "Redo, OK, that's fine.",
    "And then we used the lettering rake brush, but I think I want to do this.",
    "With a different texture, I'm going to see how many of the Mega Pack brushes I can get loaded.",
    "And we can choose from that with the Birch brush is a good one.",
    "It seems like there's some weird glitching with it.",
    "Try the other Birch.",
    "That might be good.",
    "OK, let's stick with this.",
    "Let me favorite.",
    "Favorite my favorite, the other one too.",
    "And I will grab.",
    "The dark blue.",
    "Will make the brush bigger.",
    "With a Fuller flow.",
    "Much bigger please.",
    "And let's fill it out.",
    "I'm going to try and keep my strokes as horizontal as possible, since these A.",
    "That's not good, since these fields are very horizontal.",
    "I want to keep that motif through the whole thing.",
    "And I might even change my blend mode to clear and just like slightly.",
    "Fuzz out these edges a little bit.",
    "And go back to normal.",
    "Slightly filling back in.",
    "Call You tried.",
    "It works better, yes?",
    "You feel like selections.",
    "Our digital artist.",
    "Secret weapon.",
    "I think so too.",
    "It's like using tape with a real painting.",
    "You literally by your iPad pro to try fresco.",
    "That's awesome.",
    "I hope I hope it works in every way that you want it too.",
    "It's still a growing app though.",
    "New updates every month.",
    "Take an invisible tea break.",
    "Alright, and now let's add some of these shapes for these furthest back.",
    "Hills.",
    "So I'm going to.",
    "Got that color again, but go a little bit brighter.",
    "We're saturated, maybe even a little more towards the green.",
    "Side of things.",
    "Here.",
    "Can I go brighter?",
    "Oh no, that's not what I wanted.",
    "Here you go get those highlights.",
    "Let's add in another Ridge.",
    "Grab this color again.",
    "Brighter.",
    "Go brighter, go home.",
    "I'm gonna grab this color again.",
    "Actually Minecraft this one.",
    "OK.",
    "I've got a country Rd stuck in my head.",
    "Not sure why.",
    "Then I'm like a back.",
    "Let's go to a recent tellers.",
    "That's what I want.",
    "Will get this most most foreground the shape I know there's a road is somewhere in here too.",
    "To go for this.",
    "For the highlights.",
    "Come back with this.",
    "And then go to this.",
    "Building up that background.",
    "Is that cadmium blue and titanium white?",
    "This is a little Bob Rossi, isn't it?",
    "You don't know much about fresco.",
    "These are life brushes, right?",
    "This is not alive brush.",
    "These are just normal actual Photoshop brushes from Kyle Websters Mega Pack that you can download if you have a CC subscription.",
    "I'll show you the life brushes real quick.",
    "So you find them in the second brush section.",
    "And you can either do watercolor or oil.",
    "There are more brushes coming in the future.",
    "It would be fun to do one of these lasso tools with the live brushes.",
    "So with the oil I could do this color.",
    "Grab this one run brush and mix them.",
    "Just like real oil, man.",
    "You can change the amount of mix that you have.",
    "So that's less of a mix.",
    "Or we could do like almost completely.",
    "Next, for real blurred edges.",
    "And you can also still change like the texture and the angle in all of the dynamics of the till in the tilt and the pressure.",
    "All that good stuff and there's water colors too.",
    "I just show you real quick.",
    "Watercolors are my favorite.",
    "So you can see its bleeding a little bit.",
    "And then let's go from the blue.",
    "Gosh, you keep doing that.",
    "They will go for like bright yellow.",
    "Start to bleed together.",
    "Just like real watercolor.",
    "OK, back to our normally.",
    "Scheduled programming.",
    "So we have a general shape for the background.",
    "I'm just kind of whatever on it at the moment.",
    "It's like the Sky yellow.",
    "Because why not?",
    "Go a lot later.",
    "Like that color, I think that's from the previous sketch party.",
    "One thing I don't like about this Birch brushes it has like hard edge as it's hard to get built up texture without going too far too quickly.",
    "But we'll make it work.",
    "Might also just need to play with the blend modes a little bit more.",
    "All right, we're going to get this road drawn in here.",
    "So it is on.",
    "Its own kind of raised.",
    "Area.",
    "I'm gonna grab the Marigold color.",
    "Go lot brighter.",
    "A lot less saturated.",
    "Cash is over there dreaming Truman Sweet Puppy dreams.",
    "Back to Miss Kelly.",
    "Lock the transparency here.",
    "Grab the purple.",
    "Alright, let's start filling in these fields.",
    "Fill in the fields.",
    "Great colors mix light.",
    "Nice Charles.",
    "Noise it love a whole lesson on mixing colors and making themes to keep under scream like you've got there.",
    "Hey, that's a great idea.",
    "I could show you Adobe capture, that's an awesome way to make color palettes.",
    "You feel that you're into us is too big.",
    "I don't do wide gestures when I draw, so I'm new.",
    "I'm the new welcome into a small looks better.",
    "It's also wireless so no Courtney Maru.",
    "Nice, the Wakeham Intuos at least I guess maybe it's the pro one.",
    "Also is Cordless.",
    "It needs to be charged, but.",
    "The USB cord gets on my nerves since it's on the wrong side.",
    "Yeah, I have to switch mine.",
    "I switched mine 'cause I don't use the buttons on my medium so I always switch the cord to be on the right side so I'm not always bumping into.",
    "It captures the bomb.",
    "Yes Steven, are you a capture of Angeles too?",
    "I haven't used it in too long.",
    "There was I doing filling in the field.",
    "Yes yes yes.",
    "This is going to be fun.",
    "It 'cause I can do it in.",
    "One fell swoop.",
    "And then I will paint the stripes on top.",
    "So we're going to go for the lightest.",
    "But if we do like a purple to yellow field, that will be weird.",
    "Because those are complementary colors.",
    "But I'm OK with weird.",
    "We'll start with this.",
    "Go pretty big and we will make at.",
    "The highlight color will fill in.",
    "The field with this first.",
    "No, go even brighter.",
    "Build up that dark underneath the light.",
    "Can a texture?",
    "And they will go more saturated.",
    "And get some of that going on too, whoa.",
    "That noise bother you guys.",
    "Starting to get on my nerves, but what can you do?",
    "You gotta draw.",
    "All right, now we can add the shadow in over on the left.",
    "Let's put on a new layer 'cause I have a feeling I probably won't like the first one that I do.",
    "I know myself.",
    "And we can also play with blend modes this way.",
    "Gonna grab this purple.",
    "Let's change our blend mode too.",
    "Multiply, make the brush pretty big.",
    "Flow pretty low.",
    "We got a guest star in the stream.",
    "Smarten That's not what I wanted.",
    "Website.",
    "They're under the sink.",
    "So once I had a gas.",
    "OH baby.",
    "And he locked Koshi in here with me again.",
    "That's cool, that's cool.",
    "Need to get a second Mike to capture the full ASM are goodness.",
    "I will never do that.",
    "Oh, that's cool.",
    "This is when we play with other blend modes and see which one looks the best.",
    "Multiply is probably the answer, but you never know.",
    "Sometimes it can be surprised.",
    "Who?",
    "Get out of My Swamp.",
    "All right?",
    "That's cool for now.",
    "Steven says I guess so does Jan.",
    "Erik, he's gone.",
    "He's asking me where the bleach wipes were to wipe down the groceries.",
    "Steven, you mostly use pallets based on photos.",
    "You like the colors from.",
    "It's good to limit yourself to 50 Totale.",
    "I agree.",
    "I always try to build up with likes a dark value, light value, middle value and then the two other ones.",
    "Ones usually like a accent color and one is like a more saturated light or more saturated dark.",
    "See how this is all coming together, oh?",
    "I don't know about this color palette, you guys.",
    "Just don't know.",
    "Do you wanna go outside?",
    "Alright, hold please.",
    "Be free.",
    "Your girls back.",
    "By Neural scribbling with Kathleen Chill.",
    "Ustrated 10 hours of chill.",
    "Scribbling would make me thousands.",
    "You just did that this morning with the groceries.",
    "Wasn't sure if we were the only ones.",
    "Oh no, no way.",
    "Gotta wipe him down.",
    "You never know.",
    "This is like a nightmare of landscape is not a bad thing.",
    "It's just looking at.",
    "A little spooky.",
    "That's kind of cool.",
    "What do we think?",
    "Oh God.",
    "Boo.",
    "Well, if I do this then I get the chance to start over.",
    "Oh I think the yellow Sky is kind of freaking me out too.",
    "Do do do do.",
    "Right?",
    "Let's try that background again.",
    "The fact that it's not like literally Green is bothering me.",
    "But when have I ever gone with representational colors?",
    "So ever happened?",
    "You guys?",
    "Your pencil nib size to unscrew itself.",
    "Wow.",
    "I will go for that.",
    "In that good good texture filled in here.",
    "Oh my brushes still multiply.",
    "That's not a bad thing though.",
    "Gives us an extra layer of depth.",
    "Why is country Rd stuck in my head?",
    "I just want to sing about West Virginia for some reason.",
    "They call this a challenge because it's not supposed to be easy.",
    "OK, this is how I'm going to designate the different sections just by adding the highlight on the right side.",
    "That will help me break it up a little bit.",
    "Or the left side?",
    "Yikes.",
    "This one will go a little more saturated, little brighter.",
    "There we go.",
    "Update.",
    "But this one I'm going to lock the transparency.",
    "And we are going to.",
    "Go back in.",
    "This lighter color.",
    "Turn this off for now.",
    "Yellow Sky I'm fine with that.",
    "You like the sounds like sci-fi.",
    "That's right, kakashi do I be free, he's a good boy.",
    "What's up, Daniel?",
    "I think already said hi to you.",
    "So how I bent the little bar that holds the pencil nib slightly in my pencil only will skip occasionally in the nip.",
    "Always on Titans weird.",
    "The little bar Yeah, I mean when you look at the nib it's.",
    "Very flimsy.",
    "I feel like I got crash it.",
    "Do you print your personal work?",
    "That would be so fun.",
    "That's a good idea.",
    "Have not printed anything because I'm lazy and I don't have a printer and I don't want to pay for someone else to print it.",
    "So I've ever give anyone artwork.",
    "It's always like painted on paper.",
    "Speaking of, I need to do some paintings.",
    "'cause a certain day is coming up.",
    "That requires gifts for loved ones.",
    "All right?",
    "But at the bars and drop the bars.",
    "Do do do do.",
    "Feel that I'm not helping him put it.",
    "Put away the groceries.",
    "He did the shopping and he's putting it away.",
    "Snaps.",
    "Alright, let's try this.",
    "I'ma go for the same dark blue over here.",
    "Then I'm also going to just go ahead and.",
    "Let's",
    "Had some of the darkness over here too.",
    "I know this happens to you guys too when you're making art and you just kind of like.",
    "Not really feeling this direction, but I also know.",
    "It is my tendency to not love where something is going, and then I really enjoy where I land even if I have to redo things or.",
    "Try out different techniques.",
    "This is like the best excuse for me to try stuff that I've never done before, 'cause I'm like, well, it kinda don't like how it's going anyways, so.",
    "Why not try something else?",
    "That's when the Magic happens.",
    "We're going to unlock this.",
    "That in there.",
    "I like my Lions.",
    "Got a little bit crooked.",
    "I'm going to.",
    "Rotate the yet.",
    "Make sure it stays horizontal.",
    "It really is a little bit too.",
    "And don't forget this moment we got this ruler down here and I used it for the sketch and I'm not using it for this.",
    "Well, that doesn't make sense.",
    "There we go, looks better.",
    "You're doing a portrait with me instead of a landscape today I can't focus to do a landscape.",
    "Nice, but a portrait is somehow easier.",
    "I like portraits like a million times easier than just.",
    "Copying a photo.",
    "Nice job.",
    "It would be cool to make a blurb book or whatever with your own art in there.",
    "I plan to do that with your photography cool.",
    "I made my senior portfolio was a blurb book.",
    "Is it in here?",
    "Would be fun to show you guys.",
    "I want to go see if I can find it super quick.",
    "I'll be back in like 30 seconds.",
    "OK, right back.",
    "Found it.",
    "So about.",
    "My art school experience.",
    "I didn't finish my senior year very strong.",
    "Because I already had a job lined up and I was like.",
    "I guess I can just kind of chill a little bit.",
    "I mean like I finished it and got all A's and B's.",
    "Don't worry, but.",
