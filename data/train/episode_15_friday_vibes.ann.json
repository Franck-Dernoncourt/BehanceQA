    "Welcome, welcome to the stream my hairs.",
    "Does not doing it today, I guess.",
    "Does not like me today.",
    "But yeah, that's what happens when you wear hats all your life.",
    "I guess I'm just going to pull my knee up here there we go perfect.",
    "Welcome welcome to this dream.",
    "OK so?",
    "Today I kind of wanted to start off a new, um komposit But I'm not sure how far will get with it, but maybe I don't know.",
    "We'll start something new.",
    "So let's get the idea first.",
    "So let's go to our mainstage here.",
    "Perfect.",
    "Beautiful quote, alright.",
    "Let's open up a good old photo shop here.",
    "Actually, not.",
    "I'm going to just open up the discord for a second, 'cause I believe that there is a contest on here that we can.",
    "Do.",
    "Uhm yeah, OK, so let's go to community challenge 16.",
    "We haven't done this one yet.",
    "It looks a little hard.",
    "Uhm, I don't really get it.",
    "Too much.",
    "Because like.",
    "Collages are pretty personal anyways, so it does that doesn't really help.",
    "But yeah, I don't know.",
    "I don't really get it.",
    "I believe what I'm supposed to do I think is I'm supposed to create an image with like 5 stories in it.",
    "But I don't know all right, so let's let's go on Adobe stock here.",
    "Actually, let's look up some inspiration first, let's see if there's.",
    "Go on Behance.",
    "See if there's any inspiration up here.",
    "OK, let's search photo manipulation.",
    "Oh, I know.",
    "I know this artist, she's really good.",
    "OK, so.",
    "Not really seeing anything that I really.",
    "Really want to do.",
    "Oh, this one's really cool.",
    "But I've kind of.",
    "I think I've seen this concept like a few times already.",
    "But I mean like it is kind of cool though like.",
    "I mean, we could.",
    "We could try it.",
    "We basically just need like a skin to see like most of this I think was drawn like this skin was, I think, drawn.",
    "I like it, though.",
    "That's a cool one.",
    "That's definitely some inspiration.",
    "I'm going to give that wanna like.",
    "Uh, let's see what is possible here.",
    "We've tried something like this before, I'm pretty sure.",
    "Uh-huh This is kind of a cool technique like making everything like Forestry and stuff, but I'm pretty sure that this is just like.",
    "A photo shop filter.",
    "And I think that I actually have this.",
    "So let's just go to themeforest.net for a second.",
    "Oh, that's cool you can do before and after slides on your.",
    "That's interesting, I didn't really know about this feature on on a project before.",
    "That's a game changer right there.",
    "I like how they removed like most of the cars here, they just kind of like place like other cars on top.",
    "I'm pretty sure these are pixel squid elements.",
    "Um, broken.",
    "All I know a good one, I know what we're going to do.",
    "OK, so we are going to let's go to let's go here and we need an aerial.",
    "We need aerial water shot here.",
    "I know what I'm going to do.",
    "OK so this one works pretty good actually.",
    "We need something zoomed out a little bit more.",
    "This one might work pretty good, but how long is that 10,000 pixels?",
    "That is huge.",
    "That is huge.",
    "Oh my goodness, I make what's up?",
    "How's it going?",
    "My friend?",
    "Welcome to the stream welcome.",
    "Welcome today.",
    "We're going to be making a an image.",
    "I just need to find.",
    "Oh, this is it right here, perfect this is it.",
    "Let's licenses.",
    "Alright, so I just needed some water here.",
    "Let's open up photo shop.",
    "Where is my library's hidden?",
    "If my libraries can next.",
    "Perfect.",
    "OK, I'm gonna rotate this 'cause I always like to do the.",
    "Eat in half by 11.",
    "Cool, that's a good template to start off with for sure for sure.",
    "So we're going to grab that there.",
    "OK now let's see if we can find some like.",
    "Let's see if we can find a heart.",
    "Um?",
    "I might just be able to.",
    "That's my Gmail don't want to go there.",
    "Um?",
    "Broken heart.",
    "You just need like.",
    "I'm not.",
    "I'm not going to use this element, so we just need kind of.",
    "Like a template.",
    "To work with uhm?",
    "There's nothing that really looks like nice, though I like it's all just kind of.",
    "I mean that now.",
    "Like this, this would be nice.",
    "That's a nice one.",
    "Can you please explain the project So what I'm going to try?",
    "And yeah I can easily explain it.",
    "So what I'm going to attempt to do is I am going to take a like a heart object like this.",
    "And in the water here, we're going to kind of like recreate that heart using islands, so it's going to look like Mother Nature's like her hearts breaking right?",
    "It's going to be kind of a really interesting concept.",
    "I kind of like this one.",
    "Let's let's just use this as a template.",
    "I think that that will work.",
    "1st just going to remove black.",
    "OK, now let's get rid of this.",
    "Excuse me, I just kind of want to.",
    "Grab both elements like, separate each, separate each element English please.",
    "Alright and then we're just going to go through here, just easy.",
    "Just you know, nothing doesn't have to be too too specific or anything that was a misclick.",
    "You obviously don't want to like touch the red though.",
    "This is a lot harder than I thought it would be to click through here, but my accuracy is just like it would be easier if I was actually like zoomed but.",
    "You know?",
    "Already kind of got a disadvantage who is one of my eyes doesn't work, so we might as well just make everything tough.",
    "Alright, so there we go now.",
    "We got 1/2 of our broken heart.",
    "And then the other half.",
    "Perfect.",
    "All right now that we have our broken hearts, we need an island.",
    "So let's like we're not.",
    "We're not using this, uh, this in our overall element.",
    "So that's why I can copy it from Google right now, because we're completely removing it in the long run.",
    "But yeah, so let's grab some.",
    "Let's grab some rubble.",
    "Is there some sand?",
    "Actually, can I just heard island?",
    "Maybe they have an island already.",
    "OK, well they have the palm trees, so that's good.",
    "We need those.",
    "Um?",
    "Will call out on Broken Island Alright.",
    "Will throw that on there.",
    "We probably need some you know.",
    "Let's Add all these three elements because you know we might as well not limit ourselves with pixel squid.",
    "Alright, perfect and watch this.",
    "That actually looks pretty decent.",
    "OK, so let's let's add that to our broken island 2.",
    "And let's see if they have land.",
    "Wow, when you search land you just get like animals all over the place.",
    "This is all animals alright, so let's search like.",
    "Um?",
    "Landscape.",
    "OK, that works.",
    "I guess we'll throw some of that in there too.",
    "I just need like just some elements that are.",
    "Like this kind of where it has like the rough edges, but it's like sand.",
    "This doesn't look that bad.",
    "It's not the worst.",
    "But it would be nice if there was just like sand.",
    "Is there just sand here?",
    "This is OK.",
    "Search Search aerial island.",
    "OK, so this is going to be my reference.",
    "Not gonna license that because I'm just.",
    "Referencing it.",
    "Just so that I know what I'm not, that's why I know what I want.",
    "Oh, terrain, yeah terrain, that's a good.",
    "That's a good one.",
    "That is a good word.",
    "Definitely a good word, Joe.",
    "Yes, look at your own point.",
    "You're exactly where we're supposed to be perfect.",
    "Let's add this beautiful.",
    "It's like you think that if you search landscape you would have still gotten that.",
    "But Alright, Adobe OK, Alright Pixel squid, sorry that's not that's an Adobe.",
    "That's pixel squid.",
    "But then again, I'm just the type to complain, right?",
    "Alright, they these elements should all work for now I am going to add this one here too.",
    "And then let's get some sand.",
    "Excuse me if we have sand.",
    "Sandy won't we already got that one?",
    "Alright, that should work.",
    "I think for now.",
    "And yeah, let's just.",
    "I'm going to hang Castle in there 'cause I just have another idea for another image.",
    "So yeah, 01 second.",
    "My cat actually just.",
    "Came down here.",
    "This cat's not supposed to really be down here because she's got like.",
    "A kidney problem, so I kinda like have to make it so that she can't come down here to eat my other cat food.",
    "But she I have no idea how she even just got down here.",
    "Honestly.",
    "She must've just like opened up a door or something.",
    "So I'm just going to be right back for a second.",
    "I'm just going to put this funky little cat upstairs.",
    "Wow, that was weird.",
    "I guess you like I guess you like fully opened up like the door or something and like just decided hey you know I'm going to.",
    "I'm going to go downstairs today, alright, so let's let's bring our elements now let's see what we got here.",
    "Alright, so we have our hearts and we have everything perfect and we have our island reference.",
    "Alright, I'm going to bring in some pixel squid stuff here.",
    "I think I'm going to start with the sand around the edges 1st and then bring the landscape in after.",
    "Look at the wrong file.",
    "All right there we go perfect, so let's bring in that's and.",
    "Let's see if we can actually make it like an aerial view of.",
    "This should work perfect.",
    "We just really need like just the sand really.",
    "We don't need anything like 2 two fancy.",
    "Alright, so I'm going to just try clip masking this into here for now and see what it.",
    "OK, so we're going to have to like wave it out around here.",
    "And then curl that OK.",
    "OK, so now I'm going to go in here.",
    "And just turn on my.",
    "Mask Oh, Red Riddle.",
    "And it seems that.",
    "That's not going to help me.",
    "OK, I'm going to just change these quickly.",
    "So let's just go.",
    "I'm not, I'm not too worried about like the colours or anything like that.",
    "I just don't want it read right now 'cause I just don't want to work with it with the red color is just not.",
    "It's so bright, right?",
    "Like just not not a fun color.",
    "Alright, so let's select this.",
    "What?",
    "OK, there we go.",
    "OK now I'm going to go in with the brush.",
    "Let's go down my my secret brush back.",
    "All right, this should work.",
    "OK, perfect.",
    "Now I'm just going to kind of like roughly just go like around it.",
    "Don't worry like this does not have to be perfect whatsoever.",
    "Well, not that area.",
    "I'm just making it so that it looks more like kind of kind of rocky.",
    "It's actually good that I'm not doing it like perfect.",
    "'cause this looks more like it'll look more like saying that way.",
    "His landscapes aren't aren't always perfect.",
    "You know landscapes are just not nothing.",
    "They just you can't have a perfect cut out like this.",
    "Ooh, that's late.",
    "That's that's a pretty nice rough edge there.",
    "Maybe if I just keep dipping in and out there we go?",
    "OK.",
    "So there's our selection.",
    "I'm just going to now just kind of.",
    "Plot that in there and get rid of this.",
    "Beautiful.",
    "Beautiful, but terrible at same time, right?",
    "Perfect.",
    "See like this, this heart right here on this side is more like landscape bays and then like the other ones just super sharp so it just doesn't work.",
    "So we're going to do the same thing with island which is going to hide that for now.",
    "Select control and then select that.",
    "So now you've selected the element and then you just add your mask over it and then we just do the exact same thing basically.",
    "Just go around it and.",
    "Mess it up.",
    "Actually going to do like a little bit of a bigger brush here.",
    "OK, that actually works out a lot better.",
    "There we go.",
    "See, I'm like that, just like dip in like in and out and all that.",
    "Do you have a drawing tablet or just stick with keyboard?",
    "I personally like to, um, stick with the keyboard and mouse.",
    "It's not just it's not because I don't know how to use a drawing tablet.",
    "I think I have one here somewhere.",
    "It's just because I like to challenge myself.",
    "Even like.",
    "Even with when it comes down to like shortcuts and everything like I still, I still don't really use shortcuts that often either, only because like yeah, I just like to master like kinda everything about the software and I know that like shortcuts are like really helpful and everything, but like it helps.",
    "It doesn't help me to teach a new learner to have all the shortcuts rather than just teaching them like how to actually access like the menu Excel.",
    "So it just it just helps me out a lot longer and then like are a lot better and then people will be like.",
    "Yeah, Sean, did you know that there was also a shortcut for what you taught me?",
    "I'm like Yeah, but I didn't.",
    "I didn't want to teach you the shortcut right away, like.",
    "There's no loopholes, no loopholes in life do fully 1st, and then do the shortcuts.",
    "8.",
    "But a drawing tablet would like, yeah, obviously like speed up this process.",
    "So like if you are used to using a drawing tablet like 100%.",
    "But I can also use like the shift key to write and that and that will basically like do all my things that I need to.",
    "OK, perfect.",
    "Alright, now I'm just going to fill that in.",
    "P select and then get rid of that perfect.",
    "Less less beautiful but more.",
    "Or landscape, right?",
    "So let's now put our likes and.",
    "Texture into here.",
    "Let's see if it actually gives off like a sand texture.",
    "If not I think I do have a say in texture somewhere.",
    "Alright, that that should work.",
    "What else OK?",
    "So let's create clipping mask.",
    "OK, and I'm just going to grab.",
    "That color and then clip mask that into our sheep.",
    "For non destructive and then I'm just going to grab now like the darker colors and then kind of just same with this brush, just kind of.",
    "Click here in there.",
    "OK, blur.",
    "Perfect and then, uh, yet the shadows are off for that one.",
    "OK, now I'm just going to place all my like elements around the edge like the grass and everything.",
    "I'm basically just going to go around here because on the inside were just going to basically.",
    "Play Sara land elements.",
    "So right now we're just kind of focus just.",
    "We're just focusing on the edge right here.",
    "So I'm going to just go in here.",
    "And grab that war.",
    "I could do the puppet warp, but I'm just going to do this on.",
    "OK, that works, and then I'm going to just now kind of bring it all in here, but I'm going to add a layer mask to this one.",
    "And then just kind of use like a light brush around it.",
    "Don't mind our, uh, from doing this right now.",
    "I'm going to alter it.",
    "I just want to bring like the water up to that level.",
    "OK, now I'm going to go in and like kind of like perfect it.",
    "Make sure there's no like harsh edges.",
    "No, that's not it.",
    "OK, great layer mask.",
    "Will you be finalizing it today?",
    "Why want to?",
    "I mean I'd love to finalize it today.",
    "Would be great if I did.",
    "But just.",
    "Hard, so let's see.",
    "What will aim to well will aim to finish it, but I can't like guarantee it right.",
    "There we go perfect.",
    "And Yeah.",
    "OK, and then I put that one at 50%.",
    "OK, so now this kind of needs like.",
    "Water ripples, right?",
    "So let's see if we can find like an island element that we can put like just under it, like patchy anet will will see if we can make it look more realistic now that we have like our template of the heart and everything all down Pat.",
    "I think I'm going to license this one.",
    "Only 'cause I notice that like it has a darkness around it.",
    "So what I need to do then is we need to grab this element here and bring it underneath their hearts.",
    "And put that up.",
    "And I'm going to just go around here.",
    "Pull up our reference.",
    "OK, so you kind of see like a little bit of.",
    "Land underneath of it too, so we might have to grab some like rock assets.",
    "OK, not going to sit down to hard light.",
    "Yes, off for sure.",
    "Then I'm going to.",
    "Duplicate that perfect.",
    "I'm just going to put this on like saturation's down a little bit.",
    "OK.",
    "It's all looking.",
    "The worst so far is looking pretty decent, like we're getting there.",
    "It's, uh, it's going to be a slow like edit, but like it's getting there, right?",
    "Like compared to what we were looking at before.",
    "It's a whole lot better.",
    "So now I'm just going to add.",
    "In the adjustments here, I'm just going to do levels.",
    "And I'm just going to kind of like dark and that's and a little bit.",
    "And give it some.",
    "You know a little bit of saturation.",
    "OK, not take both those elements and just do that exact same thing to the other side.",
    "Not bad, not bad.",
    "OK, now we need some just rocks and stuff underneath here.",
    "'cause it did have like like like it has like sand and everything underneath there.",
    "So let's see if we can.",
    "Actually I'm just going to license this one.",
    "Let's start a Patch like those like smaller details in.",
    "What's going on?",
    "Did you not download?",
    "12 seconds.",
    "Just made a 3D model of the sword this morning.",
    "I think I'm going to make.",
    "An an alert out of it?",
    "What do you mean?",
    "An alert by an alert?",
    "What do you mean by making alert out of a sword?",
    "Like a.",
    "Like if somebody touches your sword, you got like a notification to your phone.",
    "Somebody has just wielded your sword.",
    "Ah.",
    "That wasn't it.",
    "What is?",
    "Where is it?",
    "What is it called 300?",
    "There we go.",
    "OK.",
    "So let's create a layer mask to this one.",
    "So reveal all and then I'm just going to kind of go around and get rid of some elements.",
    "We don't want anything in here.",
    "OK, now I'm going to duplicate that.",
    "OK, and let's get rid of that all appear all this fanciness.",
    "Going on, we don't need, we don't need fanciness.",
    "Well, we do need fanciness, but not yet.",
    "OK, I'm going to go in here again with the.",
    "White Russian just cannot.",
    "Yeah, just going to fill in those gaps there.",
    "Cool cool cool cool.",
    "Do you ever?",
    "Do you ever worked with after effects?",
    "Yeah, I work with after effects here in there but I just like I wouldn't like to open up after effects normally like when I'm streaming.",
    "I probably won't be like I probably won't be doing any after effects.",
    "The only because I'm not sure like how well my PC can take that yet.",
    "So I'm not really like testing any of my limit, so don't really want to yet.",
    "And I know that like illustrator after effects or not illustrator, it's pretty intense, like it's a pretty big software.",
    "So when I'm streaming it's like.",
    "Steven Beggar OK, that's looking a little bit more landscape you there?",
    "Alright, I'm going to now just go into here.",
    "I'm pretty sure that that color tone is off, so let's just put up the hard little bit.",
    "Actually, let's go on to softly.",
    "Reserved and soft light and let's crank this all way up.",
    "No need like color.",
    "One of these settings going to work.",
    "Vividly.",
    "And then will change the color of it maybe?",
    "Oh, there we go.",
    "Perfect.",
    "OK, now I'm going to do like the exact same thing too.",
    "To this one.",
    "Actually could probably just like.",
    "Then And such a nondestructive editor.",
    "It's great again.",
    "Now it's bringing out our trees and stuff that's looking that's looking pretty good.",
    "So far, what software are used for your 3D renders?",
    "Uhm, so far, 3D.",
    "Like all 3D stuff.",
    "Normally it's either I get it off of like Adobe stock or I.",
    "I just kind of like assume like I just make the 3D element out of other 3D elements, if that makes sense.",
    "I don't really know how to make like a 3D element from ground up.",
    "I'm working on that I'm working on getting like into that, but it's it's a lot of stuff because like we were really taught that stuff in my college like we did not get into 3D like at all.",
    "And I think it really kind of set us back which sucks.",
    "OK, and then I'm just going to bring that element back in here again.",
    "'cause I've played with this one like way too much and warped and flipped it and.",
    "Everything I'm just going to kind of like.",
    "Use that as an example.",
    "Forests.",
    "A forest.",
    "Alright, so now let's see if we can find like a like some trees or something.",
    "Decimal drive pretty good.",
    "Is there like multiple trees?",
    "No, I think they only OK well that that 'cause I'm pretty sure the ether on islands.",
    "I'm just going to add a bunch of just.",
    "They want to start an Oak tree on their sure.",
    "Um?",
    "Alright, that should work.",
    "Let's see if we can make any of these elements aerial.",
    "OK, so now I'm just going to kind of like group all of this together.",
    "Make it make a blue and then say like under I island.",
    "Perfect and I'm just going to add a layer mask now.",
    "To that group, and then I'm just going to go around with my eraser brush just to make it match the ripples again.",
    "Kind of.",
    "I think I have to just bring this one on top and clip mask it into their.",
    "Cool COO COO COO?",
    "Actually, I don't like it with that one.",
    "I like it like that.",
    "Alright, perfect up and then what I'm going to do now is I'm just going to start placing trees.",
    "Actually, let me just.",
    "Package this for a second.",
    "So we know where we're at.",
    "So what is this?",
    "OK, you can see like that.",
    "This island ception You see the island underneath and I'll.",
    "There's an island underneath that island.",
    "Did you know that?",
    "No Siri, I'm not talking to you.",
    "Not talking to you right now.",
    "Siri get outta here.",
    "Stop interrupting me.",
    "We can make these red.",
    "Just that we know that they are the heart.",
    "Get rid of that 'cause we licensed it now woo were fancy.",
    "OK, so let's start placing these trees alright.",
    "So pixel squid again.",
    "Refresh it.",
    "Perfect.",
    "See if we can make this a work for us.",
    "And bring that to the very top.",
    "Haha beautiful.",
    "Remember that like the trees will never really be close to the water right?",
    "Because trees want to survive, so they they just.",
    "They don't want to get close to that at all.",
    "And right now I'm just kind of doing like the outer.",
    "Besides, first just keeping like will go in inside here later an like an ad like you know a small tree here or something just so that starts like blending it together.",
    "But right now I'm just worried about getting around this side and then around that side 'cause it's easy just to plop a tree on top and blend that in like trees, Latin grow on top of each other all time.",
    "So your main goal here would be just to just to edge.",
    "This nicely.",
    "And like I'm not worried about like shadowing or anything right now 'cause that's just like a final that I that I'll do at the end.",
    "I'm just worried about laying out my project.",
    "OK, and then we're just going to go right in here.",
    "And then I'm just going to make like a light, nice little little tiny small guy in there.",
    "Just as so difference right?",
    "OK so let's see what that looks like so far.",
    "Not bad, not bad.",
    "OK.",
    "You'll have to walk the grab like some shadows and stuff, so I purposely made it so that my light is coming from over here.",
    "So let's just get our lighting first.",
    "Down Pat.",
    "You know me, I like to.",
    "I like to mark my lighting.",
    "OK, so that is where my lighting is coming from lighting.",
    "Hide that for now.",
    "OK, now I'm just going to go over here.",
    "Do the same thing to that side.",
    "I might be able to just cheap it out and I might be able to just duplicate and swap, but.",
    "We don't know that yet.",
    "I don't.",
    "I don't know for sure.",
    "This is.",
    "Oh my goodness.",
    "Not really creating a murder scene.",
    "This is just this is Mother Nature's man, Hey.",
    "I have feelings too.",
    "Is the ads probably something that Mother Nature would say?",
    "I don't.",
    "I don't personally know Mother Nature.",
    "I mean like.",
    "She seems nice, but.",
    "Hi.",
    "I've never personally met the girl.",
    "So let's just suggest these a little tad bit.",
    "Sorry I just got, I just got an email.",
    "Sometimes when I get emails, it just like I'm just like.",
    "What does that say?",
    "This just completely sidetracked me.",
    "Ha ha ha.",
    "OK, so let's make this on smaller.",
    "This is just like my default, like forest, right?",
    "Not anything too nice.",
    "We're going to like.",
    "Will go in there and fix it, obviously.",
    "OK, that seems decent.",
    "Perfect.",
    "Oh Mario alright, so not too bad.",
    "Not too bad so far.",
    "I also see her face in the trees ghost.",
    "Don't tell me that it's gonna.",
    "It's going to scare me.",
    "No uhm, I see that base to watch it, so I'll just quickly quickly highlight it.",
    "See if see if this is the one that you're talking about, because I see two phases.",
    "Is.",
    "There's one and then like.",
    "This one is like a big.",
    "There.",
    "The pieces done ship it out.",
    "Ship it out, sell it, get off clients by it his art.",
    "Yeah I would.",
    "That would be pretty funny, alright, uh?",
    "So let's add.",
    "These these fancy little trees in here.",
    "Doot doot Doo.",
    "Boosting that quality.",
    "Hopefully my heart, you know I I know why photo shops really slow right now.",
    "Alright, let's let's do something that I always have to be doing.",
    "Alright, so I'm just going to close this piece.",
    "Does my trump piece I'm working on right now?",
    "I don't really have a tutorial for that one yet because I'm just winging it, so why I wing most of my pieces, but I'm just I'm totally winging this one.",
    "But yeah, I know, uh, so what's everybody up to on this Friday?",
    "Uh, anybody got any weekend plans or anything like that?",
    "Let's see.",
    "What's the weirdest weekend plans throwing throw your plans up there because like I know that there are some people who are doing weird tasks out there.",
    "And Uhm, Yeah it would be.",
    "It would be kind of cool to compare.",
    "But anyways, I've I'm not doing anything this weekend specifically.",
    "I'm actually going to go visit my girlfriend.",
    "She just lives like.",
    "Maybe an hour and a half away from me, so I'm going to go in going to go visit her.",
    "I think this weekend.",
    "Get some relaxation in, you know.",
    "But I'm not doing anything to funky.",
    "The reason why I use like two different trees completely when you're building a forest is just because, like it just creates a little bit more more depth.",
    "You're not going to necessarily get.",
    "All the gaps in here like I'm not going to get all those, but I'm going to just kind of go in with, I think rocks or something after an just edit those.",
    "Nicely in there, but right now I'm just kind of like, you know, just these are just fills.",
    "There's no strategy right now.",
    "I'm just winging it, you know.",
    "Sometimes artist meant winging it.",
    "Probably should have sorted out where I was winging it though.",
    "Going to wing it up in this area here.",
    "I just need to kind of like some like rubble now, so let's grab some like.",
    "Actually let's look at our island reference for a second.",
    "And let's see how we can compare.",
    "Where is it?",
    "Where the heck did I put that?",
    "OK, there we go.",
    "Whoa, that's a Lotta.",
    "Um, I'm just going to throw all this together now.",
    "Because because I can't.",
    "Perfect OK so yeah, this is just going to be the greenery.",

    "Mega green Make a Green No.",
    "'cause I'm going nowhere.",
    "Just plan on participating in the oh is there design awards for that?",
    "That would be pretty cool if you wanted it.",
    "Like I don't know if you're comfortable with sharing stuff like that, but if you want to.",
    "Um, we would appreciate that if you just kind of like through that contest in the chat later.",
    "We could probably take a look at that and see.",
    "You know how nice how nice that contest is.",
    "I'm I'm personally trying to enter the Adobe one in right now, so let's let's try and see.",
    "Let's go to let's just quickly go to an Adobe.",

    "Kind of stuff.",
    "I mean, that was not.",
    "That was a little bit illustrated that was nice.",
    "But yeah, it'll be hard to balance school.",
    "It's going to be hard to talk these ones.",
    "Like like stuff like this, but you know, like there's so many design options in there.",
    "OK, cool, let's design, uh, let's grab this one that you have here.",

    "A reveal all, and then I'm just going to go in with that.",
    "I'm just kind of going in and fixing my sloppy mess with my.",
    "With my brush here.",
    "Cool cool cool cool.",
    "Slowly getting there will have to go around here again and just kind of like.",
    "Do you know similar techniques?",
    "Duplicate that, bring it over here.",
    "Candace transform foot that one horizontal?",
    "Our right and then we're just gonna go up here.",
    "OK.",
    "Not bad, not too shabby.",
    "Oops.",
    "Cool cool cool alright and now I'm just going to a duplicate this how long have you been using photo how long have you used?",
    "Photo shop Sean I've been I've used Photoshop for over 13 years as just like a.",
    "Side little thing.",
    "Um?",
    "I try and be a man of all trades so photo shop is not the only software that I touch upon.",
    "Uhm, but.",
    "But yeah, it's it's basically like my main one, I'd say.",
    "But yeah, I can basically almost create anything in photo shop now it obviously it just like things take like specific techniques.",
    "All that.",
    "But I basically yeah, I'd like gotten to the point where like if somebody's like hey what do you like?",
    "How do you do this?",
    "I can like?",
    "Basically text them how to do it?",
    "Um?",
    "Without even looking at the software anymore.",
    "For all Adobe like all the whole suite.",
    "OK, I like that kind of, but I'm going to pull it back a tad bit.",
    "I don't mind that.",
    "OK, up here.",
    "Not too bad.",
    "And then we'll just like clip mask this stuff.",
    "Now, probably like now they have all of our all of our broxson elements and stuff will probably just go in and do like lighter ones.",
    "That maybe we can just like lightning to hear overlay it.",
    "Actually not, let's just grab all these elements.",
    "Will do rock mountain, sorry.",
    "Make that.",
    "Ray And grab both of these.",
    "Duplicate it together.",
    "Bring it under knee.",
    "Make it like black.",
    "Actually don't even need to make it like I could just bring it down.",
    "And then overlay it.",
    "Actually, I do need to make it black.",
    "And then we need to.",
    "Blur that.",
    "Cool and I am just going to put both of these into a folder and call it heart.",
    "Create a clipping mask and clip it into that.",
    "And then.",
    "Grab a like dark brush.",
    "Soft.",
    "And then soft like that.",
    "'cause you don't want it to look like you know.",
    "Too realistic in certain parts and now in our forests here we're going to do like the exact same thing, basically.",
    "Softly.",
    "This one we're actually going to add like highlights to it though.",
    "That Island is coming together.",
    "Yeah, it is coming together pretty good.",
    "I like it's not too.",
    "It's not the worst like it is kinda like obviously it is like completely like a fake island, right?",
    "'cause you can definitely tell that it is.",
    "But like.",
    "I don't know this.",
    "I think it's kind of a cool technique to use personally.",
    "OK, and then, uh, let's just kind of go down here.",
    "Oh wait, no, you know you want to know why it looks so weird.",
    "It's 'cause we didn't do the same thing to our mountains yet.",
    "That's why I was like why is it so bright over here, OK?",
    "That's why it's looking very unnatural is because this.",
    "And then at the top.",
    "We're going to do highlights.",
    "OK, now I kind of got not have to create like some elements in here.",
    "Just so like kind of fix it a little bit you know.",
    "So let's grab some like little rocks.",
    "Oh wait, I think I already grab that.",

    "Turn off the The Shadows and everything.",
    "Yeah, it's coming together pretty good, uh?",
    "Why am I a pretty easy, pretty easy to do, pretty easy technique.",
    "There's stuff that could automatically do this for you, but like.",
    "Where is that fan, that right?",
    "This is just me, kind of like you know, perfecting that rock a little bit.",
    "Cool and we can like.",
    "Now here, here's a container ship.",
    "Yeah, I'm just trying to put like products and stuff that.",
    "I know that aren't really like the greatest problem.",

    "Do do do do do.",
    "This is like framing your peace.",
    "Um, that looks like it's coming from the bottom.",
    "We might have to use this one again.",
    "No, this one.",
    "OK, that works, and then we'll bring our military guy up here.",
    "What am I doing right now?",
    "There we go.",
    "That one doesn't look like K I'm I'm just gonna do the cargo ship because the military ship doesn't look that good.",
    "I'm I'm not going to idea.",
    "I think I look like crap.",
    "Alright, let's let's have lesson here and I'm just going to add another cargo ship up here.",
    "OK, so I'm going to flip that side first.",
    "I'm gonna do my Goodall.",
    "Flip horizontal and then let's control this a little bit.",
    "Oops.",

    "You could say like.",
    "I had on it.",
    "I don't know you just go OK.",
    "Like it didn't give me anything informative at all.",
    "I could rent on this.",
    "I could rant about my Google Home for hours, so I'm just not gonna.",
    "I'm just gonna stop, right?",
    "Stop raining on my Google Home.",
    "But I think that for free, so like expect free when you get free.",
    "I'm just doing like small detail right now, don't even.",
    "Yeah, don't worry about this thing.",
    "I just wanted to like connect with this a little bit more.",
    "'cause this rock is necessarily what is forming this island?",
    "So there's gotta be like reasons as to why the Sands pushed out so far, like similar here too.",
    "I'm just going to like trees and stuff here, I think.",
    "'cause we did.",
    "We did get a palm tree still that we can work on.",
    "So let's add that in here.",
    "Yeah, we added some of these little guys here.",
    "That we can just throw in.",
    "I wouldn't be.",
    "That wouldn't be a bad idea.",
    "OK.",
    "Now right now, right?",
    "I had to like.",
    "Burp at the same time that I was glad to talk back there, but I just like try not to like obviously very fun on camera for you guys 'cause.",
    "Maybe an HD wreck right there.",
    "Um?",
    "But yeah, so I had like a hickup.",
    "Kind of no.",
    "Maybe I had, maybe had a hiccup.",
    "Who knows?",
    "The human, the human body.",
    "So weird.",
    "I think that these are fake.",
    "But we'll see.",
    "We'll Adam in there.",
    "I like small little things, you know.",
    "I'm going to saturate them.",
    "OK, cool and I'm just going to plop them here in there.",
    "You have to like overlap now right?",
    "I appreciate that I'm, uh, I'm happy that you guys like my work.",
    "And I appreciate you the support and feedback.",
    "Definitely definitely helps me expand.",
    "And we all like expanding.",
    "Right?",
    "Right, that's the thing, right?",
    "Set a trend.",
    "Yeah, you gotta keep your you gotta keep your pieces simple I learned when I was in school my teacher in photography always said keep it simple stupid.",
    "You let him.",
    "He literally added the word stupid because he liked to call it.",
    "He's like kiss technique so or it was a kiss technique or something.",
    "I don't know so you just have to kiss your image right so?",
    "Keep it simple.",
    "Keep it simple and people people will, uh.",
    "Will get it.",
    "Cancel review that.",
    "And especially if I, if you post on like stuff like Instagram.",
    "Like people don't really necessarily under understand like the UM.",
    "The overall concept, yeah, you like my teacher.",
    "Yeah he was, uh, he was a really good teacher.",
    "He was a really good teacher.",
    "He started me out in photography.",
    "This is a long time ago though right?",
    "So I've I've always uhm.",
    "I've always kind of like followed that term like the Kiss technique and it works right.",
    "It's just a.",
    "It's all just the.",
    "It's all just a game to kind of like, you know, make.",
    "Make exactly what you what you want.",
    "Uh, you messed up a bunch.",
    "Like a lot, you're going to mess up like all the time.",
    "Trust me happens or things mess up for you, right?",
    "Because we are in the Internet era of things.",
    "So apparently technology to states in general.",
    "Alright, so let's up what time is it?",
    "Oh, we are almost overtime so OK, so let's.",
    "Grab all of our elements now.",
    "OK, we've created a lot of layers for an hour or so, so that's where lighting is over there.",
    "Going to remove that.",
    "Um?",
    "For now, uh, OK next stream, I'll actually let's just keep him in there.",
    "Who cares?",
    "I just need to fix this for a second.",
    "Yes, and didn't come with a fancy shadow, so we gotta make it ourselves.",
    "Pretty easy though.",
    "Not too worried.",
    "Overlay.",
    "And actually, let's just do normal.",
    "There we go just a match with everything else.",
    "And then let's do are just a quick highlight.",
    "Shift click.",
    "Uh, let's see.",
    "Let's do overlay for that one, and then let's crank that down.",
    "Alright, that works Alright, so not just want to bring it in camera raw.",
    "I know I could go in here and fix all small little details and all that stuff but like.",
    "That's our reference.",
    "Pretty good.",
    "So let's grab all this.",
    "And then I duplicate and I merge.",
    "There's a a shortcut to doing all that easily, but.",
    "Not going to worry about all right, so this is our final here that I that I crop.",
    "I kind of always uh, you know, put it together at the end there it's always a good idea to just like merge it altogether.",
    "Around like.",
    "Around here like I would go in with like a high like a tool at the end, but let's just bring this into.",
    "Shifted around a little bit, make it make it look a little bit nicer.",
    "Could I edited this before?",
    "Yeah, you don't have to do it now, but.",
    "Just to make it less perfect, you know.",
    "Cool and then let's add that.",
    "That blur 22222222.",
    "Where are my blur points?",
    "But seriously, where are my blur points?",
    "What the heck?",
    "Well, it's not giving me like.",
    "Not give me my markers.",
    "Alright, let's try that again.",
    "A blur Gallery, iris blur.",
    "Where are they?",
    "Do I have something on?",
    "Can we not do iris blur anymore?",
    "Guess not OK, let's go to.",
    "Ah, I'm going to have to do it this way.",
    "OK, tilt shift then.",
    "OK, and then I have to do tilt shift the other way now.",
    "Bah, gorgeous prob.",
    "Brass approved yes yes.",
    "Thank you Bob Ross, am happy that you're here today.",
    "RIP you are good.",
    "What I can't rotate this now.",
    "Oh, there we go.",
    "It's probably 'cause I haven't updated photo shop yet.",
    "Wants me to update so bad.",
