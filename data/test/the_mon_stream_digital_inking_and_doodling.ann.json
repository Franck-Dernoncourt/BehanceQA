    "These aren't the lines that you're actually going to use for your final.",
    "Product right?",
    "So.",
    "Like how I like use my sketch is that you know I put a layer over it.",
    "Like after I do my schedule per layer over and then I refine it and then sometimes I'll do that a couple more times.",
    "There is this misconception where.",
    "You have to get it right the first time, and that's not always the case.",
    "This is this right now this is me figuring out this process.",
    "This part of it is me figuring out what the hell I'm doing 'cause I don't even know what the hell.",
    "The idea is there, but how we actually looks can be very, very different.",
    "And be messy.",
    "Don't be.",
    "Don't be afraid to be messy.",
    "Don't be afraid to have all those lines because like the wonderful thing about you know, especially if you're doing, did all the wonderful thing about using digital is that like I could stack play on the right hand side, I could stack so many layers, right, Anne?",
    "The only thing that really matters is like the end product.",
    "All of the stuff in between like This Is.",
    "This is your figuring out of phase.",
    "This is your like.",

    "I like to.",
    "I don't know.",
    "It's so weird for me.",
    "I really like thin lines, but I also like I like the thick like this.",
    "I really like this you like.",
    "Bring that.",
    "I guess I could really really thin like I like having that, but the artists that I look up to their lines are pretty consistent all throughout the image.",
    "Maybe if I like trying to use like a thinner line and in that like this it might be better instead of like having thick lines like this.",
    "I'll stop the music's too.",
    "I just let me know.",

    "Yeah.",

    "All over the place.",
    "But yeah.",

    "Yeah it's it is also bad that I don't really think about what to draw when drawing.",
    "I just kind of go for hey I'm too it's in, that's intuitive, intuitive creation and that's valid.",
    "That's a valid thing.",
    "We get psyched out.",

    "An some of them will admit like they don't know what the hell they're doing.",
    "They're just drawn things, doing revisions, you know, changing things all the freaking time.",
    "Then that's fine.",
    "I kind of think of it like if you worked at a company like if you're making a video game and let's let's take a popular video game like Mario or Sonic the Hedgehog there were before founding the Hedgehog was Sonic the Hedgehog.",
    "That was like probably 100 drawings from the art Department going like.",
    "How do we make a hedgehog look cool?",
    "They did not get it the first time.",
    "I can tell you that I can guarantee they did not get it the first time, there just figuring it out and then they had drawn, drawn, drawn drawn figure it out, figure it out until someone day everyone's like a holy crap that's that's exactly like what we thought about.",

    "What do you think?",
    "And then everyone high fived each other.",
    "Then Sonic the Hedgehog was born.",
    "So yeah.",
    "Right now I don't know what the hell I'm just making.",

    "I just like being what works or what's going to work.",
    "I just dropped people.",
    "Maybe I should think of a narrative, or you don't.",
    "And you can like that complex awesome too.",
    "Thinking of the story when you're drawing something fun back story.",
    "You know, that's cool.",
    "At the same time, you know it also offer cold to draw in weird stuff.",
    "Find hardware and craft.",
    "Is there a story to those now?",
    "Not really.",
    "It's it's like Mad Max beyond Thunderdome.",
    "Sort of what everything looks like.",
    "Hey, looks cool.",
    "I don't like how did I, I'll change it.",
    "Right, that's fine.",
    "The people say like Arts Arts a great way to kind of relax and let your brain kind of go free.",
    "I think Instagram has conditioned us a lot of artists, especially the younger's, to think like what we make has to be amazing.",
    "Like Max and doesn't right?",
    "Sometimes amazing, sometimes like the messy stuff, can inspire your next work and you know you Draw Something and it's like, oh, that's a weird like Marshmallow Dragon looking thing.",
    "You don't really think anything of it sick since made later you look at it again.",
    "It's like all the crap I'm going to make something of this.",
    "And then you just made the next Harry Potter.",
    "It can be fun, are going to be fun.",
    "It doesn't have to be.",
    "It doesn't have to be a.",
    "I'm trying to be the next Kim Genji or the next Jim Lee or the next like.",
    "Flu ish or the next?",
    "You know whatever you just be like, hey, I just want to make I just make it all I want to make a 9 tailed octopus like that's what you want to do and that's cool too right?",
    "Nothing is wrong with that.",
    "I turned to math with this moving and flow of the pencil.",
    "Do you have any specific settings or do you go out default?",
    "I usually do default, I'm very basic, I know a lot of people to customize their their feel the more I can stick to default them better I'll change things sometimes.",
    "Like if I'm thinking if I'm thinking I will go to the smoothing.",
    "Right here and then I'll adjust it a lot of times, like if I'm sketching.",
    "I don't know why this is so high when I'm sketching.",
    "I put it as low act, have a little bit of drag.",
    "I can't hang around there.",
    "That works.",
    "That's cool, that's cool by me.",
    "As you can tell by the music in my demeanor, I'm very chill.",
    "I don't.",
    "I don't necessarily need a whole bunch of fancy stuff.",
    "It's the Gen X are in Maine.",
    "I'm just like whatever.",
    "I don't wanna have a good time, you know survived hang out.",
    "The default pencil, though, is actually really, really nice.",
    "I like this compared to a lot of other iPad apps.",
    "Pencil's.",
    "They just it seems more the grit I believe of it.",
    "It could be my iPad though, because I think like that even at a slight angle it kind of initiates it and I draw on.",
    "45 degrees.",
    "So I have to like draw like this, so I'm going to put in.",
    "I'm going to put into tech support like hey, can we get?",
    "We tighten that up a little man.",
    "No.",
    "Tighten it up and taking it out.",
    "Yeah, like for well this like my iPad is first generation though it's old, it's like 5 years old, but if you ain't if you angle your pencil you get that.",
    "Here you angle it like that, but if you think about like this when you get the line and it changes various degrees.",
    "But me I like cross hatching.",
    "This is fine if I'm doing concept work, but if I'm actually like doing stuff I like to see the I see that.",
    "'cause I grew up like drawing like this with mechanical pencils.",
    "That's how I do stuff.",
    "I'm assuming all of y'all are artists.",
    "Are all heard of those when I'm streaming?",
    "I am very much like very much open for people to show their work off.",
    "If they're willing to.",
    "I like looking at people's work.",
    "I encourage people to do that.",
    "Show off their work.",
    "Kind of get.",
    "Can I get there?",
    "Get their feet wet.",
    "When it comes to like.",
    "Critique and Shyness and what not.",
    "How have you posted on your behalf and say what's up or how you doing?",
    "Have you posted on your behind?",
    "I'm clicking on your name Camden.",
    "History.",
    "Another you I could tell right away, pixel art is really nice.",
    "Enjoy that.",
    "Yeah.",
    "No refresh OK.",
    "Now we're in our business.",
    "Like barely getting stuff and other kids are going to Instagram.",

    "Good morning.",
    "In sleepy eye.",
    "This is I'm driving here.",
    "I'm going to grab this.",
    "Make it smaller so I get back to me what I'm working with.",
    "Like that?",
    "Cancel.",
    "In fact, a sketch layer.",
    "I'm the same Camden Don't don't worry I have.",
    "I have work that I haven't even posted anywhere.",
    "Like Gosh I guess.",
    "Oh Right, all of these.",

    "I haven't posted this anywhere.",
    "It's a Mermaid Darth Revan.",

    "It's really good actually.",
    "You know, I think what you really Accel on.",
    "This see that.",
    "You're very loose.",
    "You very like.",
    "I don't think you're really thinking you're just kind of doing.",
    "You're putting your putting on the flat tones and trying to get a feeling rather than being precise.",
    "See this like I think you're just trying to be, well, animation.",
    "That's pretty cool.",
    "Say like this, I feel like you have a little bit more.",
    "Looseness loving were feeling when you do not.",
    "When you're doing this stuff, say.",
    "Yeah, I like your ear.",
    "You're not, no, you're not.",
    "You're getting the essence of something and I think that's very, very important.",
    "Rather than like trying to be see like I understand what you're trying to do here, but I think the line is constricting you.",
    "Like I see what you're doing here, but like you know you're going over the same things over and over and over again when you're using like a thick brush like this like I feel this I I feel that.",
    "You gotta think about your line work like that.",
    "You have to be looser.",
    "Some people are too like controlled by the line thinking that aspie precise now would be messy brow.",
    "Messy.",
    "Hello Animation.",
    "See, that's nice.",
    "I can actually like that.",
    "Have an idea what's going on and then it's just scribbling and stuff, but I get the idea that's important coming.",
    "The ideas of love.",
    "Are you trying to outline and try to outline?",
    "Dang it.",
    "Not showing up trying to outline.",
    "Things like account now that doesn't kill it.",
    "And just like it constricts you.",
    "But that sounds like it.",
    "Pretty girl.",
    "The cost of Camden have again in better.",
    "After getting through it.",
    "Again through it everybody.",
    "All we can do.",
    "How about you?",
    "Or how are you doing?",
    "I'm going to.",
    "Cut this.",
    "He like the vibe with painting, yeah.",
    "Painting and itself.",
    "It's completely different than drawing like the application.",
    "What you're trying to do the same, but I think sometimes when you when I see people doing using pencil there two there, two stiff with using pencils.",
    "You painted with a brush.",
    "You kind of learn that.",
    "It's more effectively do broad strokes cover being portions of like the canvas rather than being so precise.",
    "Actually, you know it here, I'll show you really do this in Frisco.",
    "Slug shell, that's what I am so I can take a live brush, right?",
    "So it's like, not color that's completely blocked doing both.",
    "Right, that's not live brush.",
    "After Russia is alive, rise will take place the oil brush.",
    "So.",
    "Then what you do?",
    "OK, so when you're drawing input with a pencil or not, right?",
    "I'll put this down to like 4 when you're drawing in the pencil you like very.",
    "No, you're so concerned about.",
    "Trying to get every line right and I think this goes back to like you talking about circles than using so many circles, right?",
    "You try it in your in a lot of people that I know they outline or whatnot.",
    "They outline and trying to get make sure everything will like.",
    "Right, not right?",
    "But Bing brush figure.",
    "Like a lot bigger and you should start covering like.",
    "Covering Big blocks of.",
    "Of your area.",
    "And just kind of like even bigger than that.",
    "And you kind of just like.",
    "Try to find form like make shapes, don't necessarily like.",
    "Try to find the detail, find the big shapes right.",
    "Like I'm gonna draw, I'm going to paint this dude or what not I was gonna paint dude.",
    "I just want to like me baby shapes like I'm going to give him like a shotgun rounds back I'm going to I'm going to be a chest shoulder armor right here, like a helmet.",
    "Bring this, I'm just trying, I'm just trying to make big shapes.",
    "Right, he's making big shapes right here, right?",
    "OK so I got a big shape right?",
    "Internet little bit bigger, bigger yes crop it don't care and then I go into it right with a lighter.",
    "Then I can go in with something wider and just like trying to find, you know, just trying to find like something.",
    "Try to find like.",
    "I don't even know what the hell I'm doing right now, right?",
    "So yeah, like sculpting exactly and let's go figure like you're cutting into.",
    "Thing you don't know what you're doing, really.",
    "I know I have a light source coming this way.",
    "And decided that just right now.",
    "Appendicitis underground thing.",
    "I like the word.",
    "And then you know it will see where this takes us right?",
    "In very impromptu right now.",
    "And I like that.",
    "And I can go back and.",
    "Like pick colors.",
    "And blend things.",
    "Maybe I should change the way that I do my face proportions.",
    "Maybe I can pack could be holding me back a little bit.",
    "I'm so used to like like all faces are like, this offices are like this will not necessarily.",
    "I kinda wish this was more high res.",
    "It is far more high res.",
    "I probably like learn more from it.",
    "Where is slipping in this way?",
    "Bad.",
    "Boo.",
    "Thing is, of what I've noticed, if you look at back, I think I have some examples too.",
    "If you look back at some of his I work.",
    "Like this?",
    "See that.",
    "Technically he makes his peoples black.",
    "And I've noticed that about some of his earlier comics stuff.",
    "A key reverses it.",
    "They think you see.",
    "Kinda yeah, kinda like this.",
    "I forgot what that guys name is like right here.",
    "Pupils are part of the People's or white.",
    "And then the iris again, my anatomy mixed up.",
    "Oh listen, Liza Samuel, thank you so much for the follow two.",
    "I don't know if I said thank you.",
    "Like Oh oh, that was a good example.",
    "Why did you move?",
    "Dang it.",
    "That was a great example.",
    "Visually, sometimes it's hard to tell.",
    "Like I've used it, this is Jim Lee.",
    "Pinches is kind of weird, like doing things.",
    "That's certainly.",
    "This is.",
    "He like this, is more like that.",
    "The eyes are.",
    "The.",
    "That's it is very anime looking.",
    "Compared to like his other work.",
    "They're both right here, right?",
    "Is this Lee?",
    "A great here.",
    "And I don't think it's because like it depends on the character they look at how Sielox lies are in this one.",
    "Then also gambits the same way.",
    "So there was this thing I call an I've picked up on this to hold over this thing.",
    "Like that will do that for a character as I.",
    "A lot of time with their Asian.",
    "Like I've seen him draw.",
    "I see you trying to Mandarin.",
    "Like that?",
    "Even personal, not really.",
    "Professor acts in that picture.",
    "I've seen him draw Magneto like that.",
    "Yeah, it does depend on the character.",
    "Is a lie.",
    "It's it's a flat piece of paper, or it's a flat I computer screen, right?",
    "You're supposed to let you are incense, incense.",
    "Making The illusion of three dimensional 3 dimensions.",
    "So how do you do that with, you know?",
    "Value with color with you know, shapes.",
    "That's how you do it.",
    "OK so.",
    "'cause we aren't made of lines.",
    "That is what it is and This is why my art teacher taught me.",
    "We're not made of lines.",
    "We aren't OK.",
    "So the less dependent you are on the lines, the more like kind of real things are.",
    "Yeah, of course we're going to have comics anatomy and stuff that is just one way of doing it, so if you're getting stuck on the line part, maybe like throw away.",
    "That way of thinking.",
    "For now and then try to learn more about shapes when trying to learn more about value highlights, you know things like that composition.",
    "You know.",
    "Instead of trying to.",
    "You know, get so stuck on the line.",
    "Right, that's one way of thinking of it.",
    "Who and why isn't this?",
    "Oh yeah, so that that's Why.",
    "Then I can cut into this right here.",
    "We've seen a lot I'm going to.",
    "I'm going to merge this kind of right now.",
    "Great sound.",
    "Merge to down.",
    "Even I don't know what I'm doing.",
    "Yes baby, I'm kind of cutting into it now, making the precise.",
    "A basic Rule of thumb.",
    "Is when you're starting something.",
    "OK, here how you're drawing and what you're doing should always be loose in the beginning.",
    "And then as you're drawing it, it could be ski.",
    "Tighten it up so.",
    "Another thing my art teacher that Tommy Luce to tighten.",
    "I'm beginning, you're very, very free.",
    "You're just making shapes or just doing whatever, right?",
    "And then tighten it up.",
    "I don't even know why this is red.",
    "After I added color later on.",
    "Right now I'm just adding things to make things at this interesting like this looks like night or, like you know, something like that was like dude just add shapes.",
    "Maybe the clockwork might think that I'm adding things to it.",
    "I'm going to make this piece of armor.",
    "My God.",
    "That's all I have offsets.",
    "The other side is I got this big shape on the on the left hand side, like right here I got that shape.",
    "And I want a big shape on it right here to kind of balance it.",
    "See this like that right here.",
    "Like I like that and I like that little shadow drop shadow right there.",
    "I like how I did that.",
    "My own crap, my add some.",
    "Oh, now that's vector.",
    "I might add some.",
    "Green and this somewhere I don't know.",
    "Or not I don't know.",
    "Maybe I'm not very good with color.",
    "I'm kind of like boosie bad with color hugs.",
    "Mom still learning do.",
    "Because I have a stream on be hands, does amino more professional you know me?",
    "I'm just like you guys, I'm normal.",
    "Sorry I don't have a resume at DreamWorks.",
    "I kill swap out.",
    "Like the guy parts.",
    "The innocence.",
    "This person is sort of doing it.",
    "Lord of kind of.",
    "Jim Liard Please only his gamble, though he has eyes that are like that.",
    "I really admire artists that there black and white line work, kind of speech or else right here is a perfect example.",
    "His majority wise black with little glint of white, but it works, you know.",
    "This works very well.",
    "I want to learning this.",
    "See like his cross hatching.",
    "I want to figure out how artists do that.",
    "It's a universal thing or if it's independent to the artist.",
    "Crazy art does does it?",
    "Very like very, very well.",
    "Like how we enter plays with like black and white.",
    "There's some hatching.",
    "There are some like tones here and there, but it's basically like black lines.",
    "That's it.",
    "Black lines right?",
    "This study That's not.",
    "Here's our.",
    "This is only is like and this newer.",
    "Oh 1991.",
    "Never seen this one before.",
    "Yeah, that's I lock.",
    "Have you took out all that color?",
    "It would still look good.",
    "I learned how to draw my hands like like that, like how Jim Lee doesn't.",
    "I know that's a tone like right here this is.",
    "This is a tone.",
    "At this stuff right here.",
    "And it was like it.",
    "When you see someone that has really stiff line work overtime, you can see how it becomes relaxed.",
    "I think it's the same thing patching.",
