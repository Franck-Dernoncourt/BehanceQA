    "'cause you tend to find people that share the same viewpoints and the same interests.",
    "And because of that you become more comfortable with them and then it's like, hey?",
    "Now I've been streaming for like 6 Seven years 1014.",
    "Next years.",

    "There's a lot of different people from all different types of life and lot of 'em.",

    "I've been on a journey of trying to get better with my line work because I've been struggling with color for long while.",
    "And I came to a point.",
    "It's like you know it, let me take a step back from doing color.",
    "And try to focus on doing things that make me happy.",
    "And whenever I did like I don't like that whenever I didn't line work, I felt more.",

    "Medical doctor, medical artists, something, but you don't necessarily have to know every single ligament and every single.",
    "You know, every single muscle and every single tendon and what not, and that's what that's what he was doing.",
    "And I would tell him, like yeah, you can do that, but I think I'm more important.",
    "Skill is like trying to practice.",
    "How does clothing drape over?",
    "Someone's body.",
    "I think that's more important.",
    "How do you draw hands interesting like in an interesting manner?",

    "I wanna make like kind of messed up building that whenever I can pull this off.",
    "I think an art studio like maybe it will be soft or something.",
    "Right, so all of this stuff is learned.",
    "I think talent miss miss guides people into thinking like I cannot do this because it's it's something that you're born with and that's that's a very unusual anyone can do this right?",
    "I hope more people kind of realize that so that they can kind of more.",
    "They can enjoy art.",
    "OK, 'cause I think a lot of us have lost the concept of enjoying art.",
    "Are isn't about trying to get Instagram followers or trying to make money or isn't trying to be like you know, sometimes art is about being fun.",
    "Is having fun and not trying to be the best there is ever.",
    "How do I get there?",
    "I also have a dislike for the word talent.",
    "Talent is overrated, but what about finding what you're going to finding your eyelids is all about experimentation.",
    "As dabbling your pen into different things, you are a person has 24 hours within a day.",
    "8 hours of that is sleeping.",
    "So technically, 16 hours.",
    "Well, I slide 97, so you basically have 17 hours to find out whatever the you want to do.",
    "Sorry, sorry be heads potty mouth and go Yeah, 17 hours to figure out what you want to do.",
    "Right so.",
    "You know the experiment do different things, but trying try penciled, you know, tried digital, try painting.",
    "You have so much like you have so much access.",
    "Two starting settings.",
    "Unlike 20 years ago where you had to take a class 'cause there was no, there was no Instagram.",
    "There was no YouTube.",
    "There was no wiki house.",
    "There was no like skillshares.",
    "Right?",
    "Hi I just have a question about unaccurate perspective when doing freehand or is it ever concerned are mostly disabled for me?",
    "I I build a shed everything earlier though shared and saw me using like the circle tool, but even that I kind of freehanded it.",
    "It's all about like the M product.",
    "If your intent is for it to be symmetrical and all this other stuff, and that's when you use it, but if you're just making something eyeballing for the most part that works.",
    "Like this and this right here is a personal project.",
    "I'm not selling it to anybody.",
    "I'm just making something like.",
    "There.",
    "Instead, I bought I'm sad.",
    "If I show this to somebody and then I know ones going around with a ruler, checking if, like everything symmetric, color everything circular.",
    "That's just how I think of it.",
    "Yeah.",
    "But she can pay for it, though better take out those.",
    "So.",
    "Where they got those trace in circles and all his agitato.",
    "It is for an ad agency or something like that.",
    "Do you think someone is checking to see if it's running properly, yes.",
    "I think that there there would be more eyes on it, not necessarily going like.",
    "OK, so we all have an innate skill like.",
    "So going back to talent.",
    "Everyone has an eye for art.",
    "Rather weather people admit it or not.",
    "If I hung a painting and it was Krooked.",
    "I don't need to need a roller in order to judge that is cricket or not.",
    "If I look at a drawing and I go like.",
    "Wow.",
    "That left eye is higher than the right eye.",
    "I don't need a ruler to kind of figure that out, and I think everybody can do that.",
    "If I showed something to my mom and like take a look at the two issues.",
    "Probably, though, like all the wise, that hand bigger than the other hand and just like vastly like if it's drastically like you know, apparent like everybody has that sort of like visual sort of thing that makes him feel like, Oh, I notice I notice something you know.",
    "So because of that.",
    "If you make something for a company and you show it to a bunch of feeble, like if you show it in 10 people, I'm pretty sure an one and something is asymmetrical about it.",
    "Something like that.",
    "I think the 9th person persons pointed out and then that person will point it out to the other like nine people.",
    "And then I'll go like, Oh, you're right.",
    "And then that's when you get the callback or the email they like a without.",
    "I want my money back so yeah, in that case that's when you start being more professional about your work.",
    "Love is for your homie and it's like you know.",
    "I made you a teddy bear, you know, with some school, let me choose teddy bear holding like a broadsword and so then you know you meet emailed over.",
    "He's not going to check, he's just going to be like, yeah, that's pretty cool.",
    "Pretty awesome.",
    "So it's all about the intent of the project.",
    "Or you can also think about it this way.",
    "If your intent is to be a graphic designer.",
    "Everything you do should be symmetrical 'cause you want to have that sort of mindset.",
    "That sort of practice like everything I want to accomplish everything at once.",
    "It has to be out in a certain standard.",
    "'cause like when you put your workout there.",
    "You're basically like saying This is who I am like.",
    "Your Instagram is a representation of your right mind is all over the place, and The thing is, I don't take mine too.",
    "I don't put too much weight into my Instagram.",
    "Right?",
    "But a lot of people do for branding reasons so.",
    "In that sense.",
    "I say, like you're going to start.",
    "Start now.",
    "Bert being meticulous much work.",
    "There's nothing wrong with that.",
    "Now it's all about intent.",
    "I'm I'm very much all about intent.",
    "Like why are you doing the things that you're doing?",
    "For me, I draw stuff.",
    "I'm not using this I'm not using like.",
    "Met symmetry or not?",
    "'cause like that's just account doing it 'cause I got not really putting.",
    "Too much stock into just personal stuff, right so?",
    "If it's Commission, that's when I kind of tighten it up, you know.",
    "Long winded answer, I know, I'm sorry.",
    "I'm sorry I talk alot.",

    "Or are.",
    "Senior dues right here.",
    "I would push them more like right here.",
    "Again, it's all about intention.",
    "What do you intend like?",
    "What do you want more important?",
    "In your illustration.",
    "OK, so.",
    "If you wanted the Godzilla to be more prominent, I think the size of your dudes are fine, OK?",
    "Neither do they have like 3 dudes right here.",
    "And then a dude right here and then do right here, right?",
    "I think that's working not working just fine, right?",
    "OK.",
    "If you wanted the dudes to be more prominent and then Godzilla to be like sort of.",
    "Less prominent and then you would make you know this guy right here.",
    "And then this guy right here and then it would lead down to these dudes, OK?",
    "Anything see you have a lot of like in the mountain element, the Elvis, you you had an opportunity.",
    "To use some of those rocks or clouds, or I don't know what they are in order to guide the eye to the Godzilla.",
    "So the Godzilla itself is focal point.",
    "Within your illustration you could manipulate like the mountains or the mountains or clouds.",
    "They both.",
    "Feel like I made sort of like a trail or whatever.",
    "This sort of guides I naturally.",
    "To the Godzilla OK?",
    "And you get them done.",
    "This like a ton of different ways.",
    "Ways there mountains till ways that you.",
    "Like framing could be costume.",
    "Yeah, it's up for interpretation, but dreaming of objects is one way to.",
    "Tell your audience.",
    "That that's what you want them to pay attention to.",
    "And that's a tool that artists use in order to emphasize things.",
    "So let's say that they were clouds.",
    "Now you got your Godzilla right here, right?",
    "I could've frame Godzilla by making clouds around him.",
    "Right?",
    "And then the clouds.",
    "Kind of like.",
    "Lead to the dudes so that your eye travels naturally like you're kind of making a road to the Godzilla using objects around.",
    "You know the scene, right?",
    "Also the direction of.",
    "The direction of the characters also can help.",
    "Guide the viewers I so let's say that this dude.",
    "Right?",
    "Is looking this way.",
    "Right?",
    "Without telling anybody anything of my art piece, right?",
    "I already set up a sort of story.",
    "It's like this guy is like happy and he's unaware that a big scandal is behind him.",
    "And like is probably going to eat him.",
    "I don't have to write a caption right?",
    "I don't have to write anything.",
    "You automatically get that.",
    "By just looking at this picture right and it's because like he's looking this way away from the Godzilla.",
    "That's like, Oh OK, this is like kind of comical, OK?",
    "But Have I change direction?",
    "Of the character.",
    "Going this way.",
    "Then the narrative changes that the Godzilla is what's important, OK?",
    "When you are.",
    "Putting characters, especially people.",
    "People, animals or whatever the direction that they're looking at.",
    "The viewer will naturally.",
    "Wonder what is that person?",
    "What is that person looking at?",
    "If you have characters looking at all different directions.",
    "Sometimes that confuses the viewer.",
    "Or like why are so many people looking at so many different directions and less?",
    "You make a focal point character and then they're looking at something.",
    "Then our eyes will naturally go like OK.",
    "So what is this person?",
    "Looking at we become inquisitive.",
    "So next time you like, you set up a composition, think about stuff like that.",
    "Think about intention.",
    "Think about like what is the most important thing in this drawing, right?",
    "Now this is a perfect example.",
    "Right here.",
    "He got.",
    "Let's race all this You got.",
    "Right here you are making a narrative.",
    "You have your main character, main character, person down here.",
    "And you have your spaceship up here, right?",
    "Just making a rough spaceship thingy.",
    "Again, composition and you kind of you kind of have it like you have sort of a thing going on right here.",
    "I don't know if that was intentional or not.",
    "A lot of times we pick up.",
    "Different things that we've seen.",
    "And then when we create something, we unconsciously include them because it's like, oh, I liked how they did that.",
    "I'm going to put it in mind even though we don't actually say it.",
    "We just kind of do it.",
    "So probably you've seen this done before.",
    "Where right here?",
    "Where can you see my cursor?",
    "You should look at you go.",
    "Where right here like see you have this going up and it kind of dips down where your character is.",
    "That line.",
    "That line right there?",
    "See how you have it like going three or four times that line.",
    "Go straight to your character.",
    "That means that this is character is important.",
    "This character part what throws me off is right here.",
    "What's that?",
    "Have a like another spacecraft right here.",
    "It is kind of odd.",
    "Because.",
    "Exit sort of like an incomplete sort of thing.",
    "I get to ask him.",
    "It's kind of unintentional.",
    "Yeah, kind of throws me off because there's two ships and it becomes like.",
    "Like this side heavy.",
    "Like a left side heavy 'cause you have.",
    "This thing right here, this dude right here.",
    "This ship right here.",
    "Anna nothing going on here.",
    "Right, and like you kind of want to know if you wanted to balance things out.",
    "Like I would have probably added another ship right here.",
    "Make it look like they were following each other and he's looking up at like a ship formation or whatnot.",
    "You know I didn't couple other ships that would probably make sense for added like a moon or something.",
    "It kinda like build that kind of space.",
    "Again, using shapes.",
    "Building the form that's very important.",
    "Building the form.",
    "A lot of people do that.",
    "He should.",
    "I like value.",
    "You followed my advice.",
    "Good job Camden.",
    "And then your last piece, which is this?",
    "That's fun, that's actually cool.",
    "And allows intentional or not.",
    "I probably would have Adsense added something here you know like about.",
    "You know how I talked about framing?",
    "Like you got, you got your.",
    "Cool ship looking thing and then the lights and what not right here and then you have some purple right here.",
    "Got some purple definitely down here right?",
    "I would probably think the purple down here and then that way.",
    "Like these edges frame it so that this is important.",
    "That's how that's what I would have like to seen.",
    "But again, I like this, don't you?",
    "Don't you feel so much freer?",
    "Don't you feel like?",
    "Less restrictive and you're just like I'm just making shapes and I'm just seeing what happens.",
    "That's what I like to see.",
    "Yeah, I was actually thinking about adding something there and then it moved in.",
    "You moved out, hey, you know what?",
    "That's fine again.",
    "Like I was saying yesterday, it doesn't have to be perfect.",
    "You could you could start on something and then like be really into it, get bored of it, save it, come back to it later or not.",
    "Maybe this might inspire you to do something else later on, right?",
    "Never delete your work.",
    "Never.",
    "It's fun for sure.",
    "Yeah, see I told you.",
    "Telogia though.",
    "Yeah, it's not like.",
    "People people get too caught up with details.",
    "People get too caught up with like the line and trying to be so precise and not just.",
    "Be messy with that, you know.",
    "Be messy with the junk.",
    "No man ain't nothing wrong with that.",
    "They, even though I'm like Super, I'm super precise with us I I'm actually being very, very loose about love it.",
    "Thank you for the great your walk and then you're doing great.",
    "You're doing great my dude.",
    "If I'm going, but I'm making make funky shapes you never know.",
    "Make big shapes and then you know.",
    "Afterwards go in the little shapes in there.",
    "See what happens.",
    "Right?",
    "Never know.",
    "Fun with that.",
    "And like I'm going to have fun with wow after I stop streaming anyway.",
    "We have about 15 minutes on stream, so if anyone else has any like questions or what not just let me know.",
    "I am more than happy to like critique or give advice.",
    "You know?",
    "He doesn't have to be about art broke up with your significant other hey.",
    "I'll give you some advice how to get over how to get over him.",
    "Ask.",
    "You have bad credit.",
    "Hey, I'll give you some tips on how to do that thing up.",
    "Get a credit card right this one way.",
    "Get a credit card and designate that credit card to like only.",
    "Getting gas OK.",
    "'cause?",
    "When they look at your credit score and you have credit card on it.",
    "You don't want to Max it out.",
    "He going to Max out your credit card.",
    "You want to use at least like 15%.",
    "Of that credit card and then.",
    "Always pay it off.",
    "Every single month and that's why you only use it for gas.",
    "You don't use it by like an Xbox.",
    "Granted, I did use it to buy Chipotle once, but yeah, just universe small things in every single month.",
    "You know, pay it off.",
    "Pay it off here.",
    "All these hosts use like 15 to 20% of that credit limit.",
    "By people go like Oh, you gotta use it all.",
    "Don't use all.",
    "They want to see if you're responsible.",
    "With.",
