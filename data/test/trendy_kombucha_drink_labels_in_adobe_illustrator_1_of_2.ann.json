    "It's such a beautiful sunny warm day here in Toronto.",
    "Let me know where you're joining from in the chat so as you can see today we are going to design trendy kombucha drink labels in Adobe illustrator, so it's going to be super exciting.",
    "Super fun and it's very easy to create.",
    "And then tomorrow we are going to create a 3D mock up of our kombucha drinks.",
    "So yeah, it's going to be.",
    "Super exciting, so when I want to do is I'm just going to walk you through my design process how I like to get some inspiration and pick colors for this design.",
    "And then we're going to jump into illustrator.",
    "So as always, head on over to xlpixel.com and be sure to download the design template.",
    "That way you can design alongside me.",
    "And also I love to see what you create.",
    "So if you ever follow along with any of my tutorials or live streams, be sure to tag me on social media at XL pixel with two ells.",
    "And use the hashtag XL pixel perfect.",
    "That way I can you know feature you in the Gallery on my website.",
    "Right, he comes come crumb free country says hi from Kenya.",
    "Awesome OK.",
    "So I'm going to head on over to be hands because I really like to visit.",
    "You will be hands dribble, even just Google search.",
    "You know what I'm working on just to get some inspiration.",
    "So in this case I just searched for kombucha labels on the hands and right away I'm just seeing so many beautiful images and lots of color.",
    "Yeah, so this is definitely a really great way to get some inspiration for any design that you're working on.",
    "So right off the bat I'm seeing.",
    "This can hear this one catches my eye.",
    "I'm loving the colors.",
    "I'm loving the typeface and this mockup is so Chris.",
    "So clean it looks just so good.",
    "So let's see another.",
    "Another Image for some inspiration.",
    "He dropped sons, Jackson says yeah, I'm just thinking about design.",
    "Some drink labels in your here.",
    "That's so funny.",
    "What a coincidence, OK?",
    "So yeah, so this is just a really great way to get some inspiration, and I'm just honestly looking and just taking notes of the different typefaces, typography, colors like the bottle shapes, what they're using.",
    "Because tomorrow when we actually create our mock up we can choose from cans we can choose from bottles, so it's just it's just getting a sense of how we can approach our project today.",
    "So I'm also going to head on over to Google because.",
    "At the end of the day, is the best way to look for stuff.",
    "Is Google right?",
    "So I'm right off the bat I'm seeing this image and I actually had this kombucha.",
    "I think they sell this at cost Co so.",
    "It's I love the typeface that they used for this kombucha, but I guess for what I'm looking for I definitely want something a little more bold and more modern, so this one I must say catches my eye is fun, it's simple.",
    "It's definitely simple, but it just looks really good.",
    "I love this.",
    "It catches my eye for sure.",
    "What else can we see?",
    "Uh, that's a.",
    "I love the colors here and doesn't it just make you want to drink some kombucha?",
    "It's just making me really thirsty.",
    "I have my water here, so let me just take a sip.",
    "Yeah, this is just making me want to drink this kombucha just because the labels are so bright and so colorful.",
    "It looks really refreshing and this is something that I definitely want to incorporate for my product label when I'm designing it.",
    "I wanted to some bright colors and I really love how each label is colored according to the labor for the drink, so it looks like Green Apple.",
    "It's using green ginger lemon, it's yellow.",
    "So just really, you know trying to drive home the point that it's so important and it's really good to just get some inspiration and you can find it anywhere.",
    "You don't even have to look for kombucha labels necessarily.",
    "You can get it from nature, you can get it.",
    "If you're on a walk and you see a really cool pattern on someone's teacher, and you can apply it.",
    "You know got patterns, who your drink, label or whatever you're working on.",
    "So In addition to getting some inspiration from Google dribble, be hand.",
    "I also like to use Adobe color in Adobe color.",
    "Is such an amazing tool.",
    "So right off the bat you see this color wheel and you know you can of course play around with the color wheel to choose your colors for your design.",
    "But I'm actually going to take it one step further and right at the top here if I go into the Explorer.",
    "Link here.",
    "You know it shows me different colors.",
    "I can explore different palettes that users have made, but I can also search for keywords and this is probably the perfect instance where I can use this feature in Adobe color.",
    "So since we're designing kombucha drink, I'm just going to search for kombucha like.",
    "I'm good, so right off the bat let's see what comes up.",
    "And I'm sure I'm Adobe color user.",
    "They probably created color palettes or published color palettes on Adobe color for their product label.",
    "And already we are seeing that so.",
    "This color palette it has the red some blue I think I want something a little more colorful or more summary so really bright yellows and.",
    "Reds and whatnot.",
    "So let me just continue to search.",
    "See what's here.",
    "Out there we go, this one.",
    "We actually saw an be hand so it looks like the user even published the color palette they used.",
    "So when you are working on to these projects, if you don't want to use the colors that are in the design template, definitely use Adobe color an what you can also do.",
    "So let's say this is the colour palette we want.",
    "You can actually just click add to library and it's going to add it to your creative cloud library.",
    "That way when you go into Adobe illustrator.",
    "You can actually pull those colors in, add them to your color Swatch library.",
    "So really cool tip.",
    "OK, so I'm just so you know I did already kind of pre select my color palette.",
    "So how about we head on over to illustrator to get started?",
    "OK, so this is today's design template in.",
    "As you can see we have 3 artboards.",
    "An each artboard represents each flavor for our drink.",
    "So I'm going to show you how I pulled the colors and add them to my color palette and then create.",
    "Of course the label and then name each art border each label based on the colors in our color palette according to each flavor.",
    "So how about we started with our first label?",
    "So as you can see I already have my color palette in my creative Cloud Library, So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to select it and then I can right click and then select add seem to Swatch is and this is going to add this color theme to my Swatch is panel.",
    "So now that I have all my colors I want to create the background for my label.",
    "So I do want to have a fun pattern or my label.",
    "So already in Adobe illustrator you can actually go into the Swatch is library and there is so many patterns that you can choose from.",
    "So I already have the decorative legacy panel here.",
    "But what you can do is you can just open the librarian in OBS.",
    "For some reason it's not showing, but if you're in illustrator you can just click the patterns library, go to patterns, decorative and then decorative legacy and then it's going to open up this decorative.",
    "Legacy panel here.",
    "So what I am going to do is I am going to see some patterns.",
    "And choose one that you know.",
    "My eye is drawn to.",
    "So I really like this in Mexico City color pattern.",
    "I think it's so abstract is really fun, so I'm just going to drag this pattern.",
    "On to my art board.",
    "And it looks good, but I definitely want to change the colors.",
    "and I also want the pattern to be a little larger.",
    "I want the tile to be bigger, so I'm just going to hold down shift in resize is pattern.",
    "And I'm going to resize it to run 1.6 inches so it's much bigger than the original, but Ducks will look that I want.",
    "So in terms of the color I want to apply colors from my color palette, of course.",
    "So what I'm going to do is I'm going to select this tile and you can actually edit the colors.",
    "You can use Adobe illustrator's recolor artwork tool.",
    "Now I would love to show you this, but again, for some reason obvious is not going to show me.",
    "The dialogue, so I can't really double that during this live stream, but I probably can, or I probably will make us video on how you can use the edit color or recolor artwork tool in illustrator.",
    "But for now I'm just going to double click this tile here and we're going to just manually change the color so the first label I want it to be bright.",
    "So I am going to actually color the background yellow.",
    "So let me just double click this background, and as you can see it's red, so I'm just going to go into my Swatch is panel and I'm going to apply the yellow just like so.",
    "Now.",
    "I also want these, you know these fragments here in the pattern.",
    "I want them to be black, so it's going to kind of match this block here, so I'm just going to select block in my Swatch is panel like so.",
    "Let me just make sure these are also the black that we have here.",
    "So super easy we we created our tile for our pattern so this is going to be a pattern so I'm just going to select the entire tile here.",
    "And I'm going to drag it into the Swatch is panel like so and we have our pattern.",
    "See how easy that was.",
    "OK, So what I'm going to do now is I'm just going to hit.",
    "Am on my keyboard or, you know, like the rectangle tool.",
    "And I'm going to draw the background.",
    "And I'm going to apply the pattern.",
    "And there we go.",
    "We have our first background pattern.",
    "Super easy and my right.",
    "Let me know in the chat if you thought that was easy because I know you can recreate this and I want to make something that you guys can easily recreate.",
    "OK, so now that we have our background.",
    "I want to add some more backgrounds, but that way we can, you know, have text that's readable on our label.",
    "So what I'm going to do again is I'm just going to draw another rectangle.",
    "Like so.",
    "And I want this rectangle to be yellow.",
    "And I'm actually going to size it so that it's around.",
    "8.9.",
    "Let me play say like so.",
    "And let's set it to around one inch.",
    "And I was gonna play stay here.",
    "Now let me just make sure this is.",
    "Extended to the edge of our earth word.",
    "There we go.",
    "So now that we have this background, whatever text we write, we can read it.",
    "'cause if we write on this pattern here, it's going to be really it's too busy to really read text on.",
    "So now what I'm going to do?",
    "Is I'm going to grab the text or the type tool?",
    "And I'm going to write out.",
    "Kombucha So the typeface that I'm using is basic songs and I kind of already decided that's what I want to use, so I'm just going to.",
    "Search for basic Sans.",
    "Ann Let me just see make sure it's bold.",
    "Anne, I want it to be all caps so right in the character panel here, I'm just going to turn on all caps.",
    "And I want tracking to the 200.",
    "And I also want the color for the text to be white, so I'm just going to apply white and I'm going to increase its size 224 pixels.",
    "Here we go and let me just online this to the center.",
    "And I think I'm going to actually change it to black, so it's really in your face, super impactful.",
    "It's bold, it's fun.",
    "I love it.",
    "OK kombucha.",
    "OK, so now that we have our kombucha title on our label.",
    "I also want to.",
    "Draw another rectangle and this is where we're going to put our flavor name.",
    "So again, I'm just going to him on my keyboard to grab the rectangle tool.",
    "And I'm gonna just draw out a black rectangle.",
    "Let me just make sure.",
    "This expensive edge.",
    "There we go.",
    "OK, let's just make this 0.5.",
    "So I'm just gonna select the mall.",
    "Annalynne everything to the center of our art board.",
    "There we go.",
    "So now I'm trying to think of what we can name this.",
    "Flavor so it's yellow and black, but to me it's screaming something that's yellow screaming I yellow fruit and I'm thinking of lemons.",
    "An earlier if you or when we were looking through some inspiration on be hands and Google images.",
    "I did see a flavor called Ginger Lemon so I think I'm going to name it this label.",
    "Ginger Lemon.",
    "Let me set this to white.",
    "Ginger lemon.",
    "So what I'm going to do is I am going to.",
    "Change the weight of this.",
    "Typeface.",
    "4.",
    "Let's see what regular looks like and I actually will decrease its size to around 12 points.",
    "And let me just make sure this is center aligned.",
    "Alliances selection.",
    "Lego.",
    "OK.",
    "So we have our flavor name and a nice bold bold letters.",
    "We have kombucha written out so I guess the last thing I want to do is I want to brand my label and I want to add a logo.",
    "So what I'm going to do is, I'm going to grab the ellipses tool.",
    "And I'm going to hold down shift and draw out an ellipses like so.",
    "And I'll resize this 2.4.",
    "And let me just make sure this is center aligned to our board.",
    "There we go.",
    "So now I am actually going to apply.",
    "Black to the.",
    "Entire fill of this ellipses, but I also want to add a stroke, so I'm just going to color this joke yellow, increase it to four points.",
    "And then let me just make sure the stroke is aligned to the outside.",
    "And this is where we're going to add our logo so our local is actually again really easy to create.",
    "So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to hit you on my keyboard to grab the type tool.",
    "Anne, I want to name.",
    "Our brands for kombucha young?",
    "Because that's just what comes to mind when I'm thinking of kombucha.",
    "It's a yummy drink, so I think Yum is a really.",
    "Is an accurate name for our computer brand.",
    "Hey Alli, nice to see you ally says hi.",
    "Just wanted to say you inspire me and I love your channel all your so sweet drop Zone said it's already it already sounds tasty though I know it does.",
    "OK, so the typeface that I want to choose for our logo is different from the you know the drink name and the kombucha text.",
    "So the type base that I'm actually going to use is kelp, a culpa new.",
    "And if you want to know where you can find different fonts for your designs, you can go to Adobe fonts and there is so many fonts you can choose from.",
    "So let me just zoom in here an I'm actually going to remove tracking so it's just going to be set to 0 and I want to increase the size of this.",
    "This text to 18 points.",
    "Let me just online this to this center.",
    "Clover circle And there we go.",
    "This is our label.",
    "We have our first label created.",
    "See how easy that was.",
    "OK, so we have our first label but again we have two other flavors for our computer that we need to create.",
    "So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to.",
    "Copy everything from my first artboard.",
    "So I'm just going to highlight everything, Press command, see, and then I'm going to select.",
    "The second are bored and I'm going to paste it in place so you can go to edit, paste in place.",
    "Or you can hold down Chip Command V on your keyboard to paste in place.",
    "So let me just do that and again I want each label to have a different color Anna color.",
    "That kind of represents the flavor, so the flavor for our second label.",
    "I want it to be.",
    "Um?",
    "Maybe Berry, maybe something to do with red, so I'm going to actually name this, Maka Berry.",
    "So let me just online at this text.",
    "And because it's Maka, Berry, and we're using berries for flavor, I'm going to use this pink color in our palates.",
    "So I'm just going to select the background here.",
    "I'm going to color it pink.",
    "And then I'll do the same for the stroke.",
    "We can just change that to pink.",
    "And then for our pattern, what you can actually do again, as you can actually go into edit colors or recolor artwork, or recolor artwork in Adobe illustrator.",
    "But again, it's not showing up for some reason.",
    "My live streaming software is just not going to allow me to show you guys that, so I'm just going to drag this pattern that we created earlier.",
    "And I'm just going to change the color of the background to pink.",
    "I'm going to highlight it.",
    "Trinket box, worse watches library and now we have for pink background.",
    "So let me just apply that and we have our maca Berry flavor.",
    "OK.",
    "So now that we have our Maca Berry flavor, I'm going to duplicate that one more time.",
    "So I'm just going to highlight everything.",
    "Press command, see.",
    "And I'm going to head on over to this thread our board.",
    "Select it and paste it in place.",
    "And we're going to do the same thing, but the color that I want for this label is green, and that's the green and red color palette.",
    "So again, let me just select the rectangle color this screen, and I think the appropriate name for this label.",
    "Since we're using green.",
    "Is green tea right?",
    "If you agree, let me know in the chat if you agree that was good name.",
    "I'm thinking Green Green tea.",
    "OK.",
    "So now let me just update the stroke color to our green.",
    "And again to change the color of our pattern.",
    "I'm just going to drag out this pattern, update the background green.",
    "And I'm going to drink it back to our swatches library or swatches panel, and I'm going to apply for your updated pattern.",
    "And there we go.",
    "So we have all three labels.",
    "We have.",
    "Ginger, Lemon, Maka, Berry, Green tea, so we're all set to.",
    "Create a 3D mock up of our kombucha, but that is for tomorrow day two.",
    "So definitely TuneIn for that.",
    "'cause we're going to dabble with Adobe Dimension, but for now to get ready for tomorrow.",
    "What I'm going to do is I really want to utilize Adobe Creative Cloud libraries.",
    "So what you can do?",
    "Or the first thing we're going to do is let's just update our names for our board.",
    "So instead of label one, it can be a little more creative.",
    "So let's just name it ginger.",
    "Lemon.",
    "And then for our second label.",
    "We can name this mark a very.",
    "And drop zone says Green Apple.",
    "Green Apple OK why not?",
    "We can change that to Green Apple Green Apple.",
    "Let me just make sure this is aligned.",
    "And let's update the Arbor name to Green Apple.",
    "There we go.",
    "OK, so we have all three labels.",
    "We've named our our board so now what we can do is we can add them to our creative Cloud Library.",
    "So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to highlight everything on the first artboard.",
    "An I can just drag it into my.",
    "CC library here.",
    "So just going to drag it like so.",
    "And there we go.",
    "It's in my creative cloud library.",
    "So again, let me just change the name instead of artwork one, let's name it green lemon.",
    "And I'm going to do the same thing for second our board for a second label.",
    "So I'm just going to highlight it everything.",
    "Drag it into my CC library.",
    "And let's change its name to Maka, Dari.",
    "And then finally, let's drag our green Apple.",
    "Label and store CC library.",
    "Now let's change its name to Green Apples.",
    "This is making me silversea.",
    "Hey Laura, so Laura ask.",
    "What which is the type base of young logo so that type based I'm using for the young logo is kapelica knew and you can find this font on Adobe fonts.",
    "OK, so.",
    "We have all three labels.",
    "It was super easy to make.",
    "Yeah, so I'm definitely excited to jump into Adobe dimension with you guys tomorrow.",
    "Let me know if you have any other questions in the chat and if you are re watching this live stream, be sure to leave a comment below if you have any questions regarding today's stream, but I hope to see you for a date to tomorrow because we are going to mock up our product labels in Adobe Dimension.",
    "So we're going to create a 3D render of our kombucha drink so it's going to be super fun.",
    "Stay tuned for that.",
    "Thanks so much for joining crumb free drop zone alley and Laura.",
    "Thank you guys so much for tuning in and I hope to see you guys tomorrow bye.",
