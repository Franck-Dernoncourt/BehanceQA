    "Use this today.",
    "To put our amount of time that will be working in for the painting so that I can keep an eye on that and hopefully not go over the time.",
    "Alright, well let's get started.",
    "I'm going to put the reference over on my other monitor next to chat, but I will keep a little mini version up here.",
    "This is using pure rough.",
    "There's a link to that below.",
    "The stream in the description if you want.",
    "It's a separate program, a separate app, but it's really handy.",
    "You can have windows hovering over photo shop if you want to have a look.",
    "A little reference up there something.",
    "So I'm just going to save my.",
    "My canvas.",
    "And let's call this.",
    "Tree stump.",
    "Watercolor studies.",
    "I have some ideas on how I will try to do this, so we'll see how it goes.",
    "And let's check our image size so my canvas size.",
    "This is the same size as the reference image, which was 1132 by 7:50.",
    "I think I'm going to make my canvas a little bit bigger.",
    "Let's go with 2500 pixels by 1656.",
    "Have the little lock here so it just made it proportionately larger.",
    "So I made the width of 2500 pixels.",
    "So that's a pretty decent size, especially for if I'm just going to be posting it online.",
    "I even could make like a small print from this and it would be fine, but usually these are just going to be digital.",
    "Bees are going to remain in the digital world.",
    "So all right, I think that's everything as far as set up.",
    "If you have any questions, feel free to ask how my goal.",
    "But yeah, I hope you guys will join me for a quick sketch.",
    "If you're in the mood to do some painting.",
    "And all, right, we've got the timer on.",
    "I'm going to put 2 1/2 hours.",
    "This is like a maximum.",
    "I would be happy if I finish this earlier 'cause then we can maybe squeeze in three more.",
    "Paint two more paintings after this, but we'll see.",
    "But I'm gonna put this 2 hours and 30 minutes is a maximum time.",
    "And I'll just keep an eye on it as we're going, so I'm going to start with a sketch.",
    "Actually, the very first thing I'll do almost forgot is I'll put a Gray paint bucket 'cause I think it's a little bit less harsh on the eyes.",
    "Do you have that background?",
    "Not bright white, so will do that to start with, and now I'm going to take a sketch, a brush and just begin planning out the main composition here.",
    "And so we've got a little tree stump.",
    "I know this reference might be a tiny bit lackluster at first, but I feel like it could be.",
    "We could turn this into a really whimsical kind of setting.",
    "You know?",
    "Oh, thank you.",
    "Thank you.",
    "I want to focus on the textures but colors.",
    "The gradients, so one thing that I noticed was in watercolor and Gouache, Atwater Medium in general is the.",
    "The you can get some really nice blends, soft gradients from one color, the next where you don't always have to have a hard edge.",
    "The referent looks like a tiny diorama tree Phillip.",
    "I could see what you're saying.",
    "I think there's something a little funky with the camera.",
    "What would you call it like the field depth of Field?",
    "The way it's focused it does make it look like it's kind of like a tiny little world.",
    "Let me get something about the the focus.",
    "And.",
    "Yeah, maybe that's one more reason that it gave me this little magical fairy land kind of feeling.",
    "So it's a tree stump without roots coming out to the side.",
    "I like these over here, that kind of, you know we can add a little bit if we want.",
    "This would be such a cool seem to add maybe some mushrooms or something like little mushrooms on the side here.",
    "I think that would be cute.",
    "Alright, so I've like over here.",
    "On the left there's a little.",
    "Puddle maybe this is on the edge of a like a pond or Lake or something.",
    "Or maybe it's just rained and there's some water collecting here.",
    "Going to try being Braves Andy.",
    "Go for it.",
    "I'm proud of you.",
    "I know this one's a little different.",
    "It's not quite a landscape environment study, but.",
    "I guess it is kind of a landscape, it's just a little zoomed in on the little portion of 1 something different.",
    "And then there's these little areas of.",
    "Moss",
    "An I really like how it looks.",
    "It's a bit neon and color compared to.",
    "The rest of the grass is, and it's really really soft looking.",
    "Thank you, you look like you could just touch it and it would be like velvet or something.",
    "But I want to make sure there's enough water.",
    "I might actually exaggerate and make.",
    "A little bit more room for the water over there because.",
    "I really like the reflections, little shadows of the grass is coming up.",
    "Kahoma thank you welcome.",
    "So as you can see, I'm using the transform tools a bit.",
    "I'll just grab this lasso Here.",
    "Freehand lasso.",
    "Make a selection of an area.",
    "If I happened to do something I don't really like and you can modify it that way.",
    "I do this a lot during my sketches and I think there's no shame in it.",
    "Some added mushrooms would be cool.",
    "Oh, thank you.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Yeah, I like this.",
    "Seems like a good place that have mushrooms, like very watery damp looking place and I've noticed, you know tree stumps.",
    "We often see mushrooms collecting.",
    "It's good 'cause it feels less overwhelming, awesome.",
    "Yeah, sometimes a big seems like mountains.",
    "Trees house.",
    "All that stuff is like who?",
    "I like to kind of work my way up to it.",
    "When I first started doing landscapes, I tried to pick something more calm, like a field.",
    "Sky, maybe a tree or two, but you know just just kind of work your way up to.",
    "Some other ideas, the next one after this is a bit more a bit more intense, but uh, that's what I'm hoping that this one will get me sort of warmed up and then that one won't be, so it won't be so hard.",
    "Will see.",
    "Alright, so in fact grass is creating this little like Dome kind of thing in the background.",
    "And then in the foreground here we've got grass is coming up more.",
    "I think I'm going to bring this down.",
    "Will change the proportions a little bit.",
    "The suit.",
    "Well, we think looks cool.",
    "And then grass is and stuff coming up here, so I'm not going to draw them in 'cause I think will do that in the painting process.",
    "But I should work.",
    "Great.",
    "How are we composition wise?",
    "If you want to check on composition, one thing that I like to do is go to few knew guide layout.",
    "And then I set the columns and rows 2, three and it pops up a like a rule of thirds grid.",
    "So I tried to arrange the tree stump on 1/3.",
    "Hey Jackson, I'm so happy.",
    "Like the references I went for watercolor, gouache, kind of.",
    "Give me S work today.",
    "Going to get along today, but I'm going to try and challenge myself with colors.",
    "My everybody so skill.",
    "Good luck, Judy, that sounds good.",
    "That sounds good.",
    "So OK, I think I'm OK with the composition, so will hide that.",
    "I will put my sketch layer on multiply mode and lower the Opacity so we can just barely see it, but it will help guide us.",
    "And then I'm going to lock that layer.",
    "All right, and this is where I need to think about that for a moment.",
    "So I haven't done this before.",
    "But what I'm really going to, I'm going to really go for like a watercolor kind of look.",
    "This is something that I've been trying to practice with my in my traditional art is like combining watercolor and Gouache.",
    "An really into those textures and mediums right now.",
    "so I thought in digital would be fun to try, so I'm thinking I can do some kind of watercolor E gradient in the background, get it smoothed, radiation from this blue you see up here in the further away background to get like this blue teal color and then all these greens.",
    "So I want to get a relatively smooth gradient through there and then we can add we can paint on top in a more opaque.",
    "So let's see through type of style and then hopefully it's going to look like watercolor and Gouache.",
    "Well, it will at least be inspired by that, so I have some watercolor brushes that I created in my Ghibli inspired brush pack.",
    "There's a link to that below.",
    "The stream in the description, but don't feel like you have to buy anything.",
    "If you have Adobe subscription, if you have the creative cloud subscription for photo shop or any of the programs actually but well, we're using Photoshop here so you can go to.",
    "You can go to your brushes and go to the kog wheel here and go to get more brushes.",
    "I can say that again, if I went too fast.",
    "Basically, once you have your brush selected, just go to the dropdown kog wheel and then get more brushes and then it's going to bring up this page and this is one of brushes that you can use.",
    "These are Kyle Webster brushes, they're really good and there's a lot of watercolor brushes here, so I'm going to use mine that I made.",
    "If you guys have my brush pack then you can use it, but you can also download to Kyle Webster one.",
    "And that kind of photo shop.",
    "It is very good too.",
    "So there's some brushes for you, but let's I'm going to have a couple of watercolor brushes.",
    "I'm going to go with this one.",
    "It has a cool effect.",
    "I think it has.",
    "Color dynamics on so you see that it's slightly alters the Hue a little bit, so it gives some natural kind of variation, so I'm going to use this on the background.",
    "And we're going to start very.",
    "Um?",
    "Soft and like, gentle blends.",
    "And I'm just going to huge shift a little bit to teal back here.",
    "We're going to go a little more intense to a deeper teal slowly 'cause we want.",
    "We want a gradual transition and one that doesn't feel hopefully doesn't feel too forced.",
    "And that looks like the water could have just seeped together with the colours.",
    "Hi Tony, how are you?",
    "So there's a little bit of depressing controls, the quite a bit over here 'cause I'm trying to test out these colors and see if they're working.",
    "I think I like that.",
    "Let's keep going.",
    "One thing that I learned in experimenting with watercolor recently is going from light to Dark is really important, and so when I'm doing the background here, I'm going to try to think of it that way and I'm starting with this pastel green.",
    "As a base and then we can go ahead and choose.",
    "A more.",
    "You know deeper, more saturated green.",
    "To continue on.",
    "And this is no details yet.",
    "No grass, only.",
    "Just we're looking at the reference as if we were kind of squinting our eyes or crossing our eyes and like blurring our vision a little bit, or taking off my glasses.",
    "Just getting an exam.",
    "Temporary dreaming picture what's going on?",
    "Will put up blue color in the water.",
    "Here.",
    "I'm trying to go for a less of a green blue.",
    "Alright, let's do another layer of Green.",
    "If you need to go back to your sketch and make it a little bit darker, you know.",
    "Up the opacity of it.",
    "You can do that.",
    "'cause Mine started getting hard to see.",
    "I'm glad you're doing good Tony.",
    "Thanks for joining us.",
    "How are you, Sir?",
    "I also have a smudge brush.",
    "Then I'm going to use to blend some of these edges if any.",
    "If there's any too hard edges or in between the layers of the gradients, you can smudge that to blow them together a little bit.",
    "Jesus, I saw my Adobe update yesterday that you can now use Photoshop on iPad.",
    "As in not just fresco.",
    "Now this is new right?",
    "Actually, I'm not 100% sure about all that because I haven't really gotten very into using Photoshop on the iPad.",
    "I haven't tried it yet.",
    "To my knowledge there was a version you could use, but I don't know about if this new one is different or or better.",
    "I think they may be improved things.",
    "I think there was some type of photo shop app for the iPad before, but I just haven't tried it myself.",
    "I think it was a sort of abbreviated version like it didn't have.",
    "All the full.",
    "Features of foot.",
    "Regular photo shop.",
    "Alright, so now we're going a little bit darker.",
    "See this blue green color coming in here.",
    "Can you bring that in?",
    "How do you get your color wheel?",
    "Hey Janice, there's a link below my stream in the description.",
    "Little paragraph down there.",
    "There's a link in a discount code for this plugin that I'm using for the color wheel.",
    "It's called Coulouris an it's a separate plugin.",
    "However if you have photo shop CC 2019 or any more recent versions of photo shop then you should have something similar available for you in Photoshop automatically.",
    "If you go to view, actually it's under window window color.",
    "There is a triangle color wheel like this now available.",
    "Before it was the Hue Cube that was I think the default.",
    "So now you can go to these menu up here and go to color wheel so this doesn't have all of the same tools as cool.",
    "Riskless has some gamut masks and other things that are nice to have, but if you're just looking for the triangle format you can go to window color an select it from the settings here.",
    "Some might be what you're looking for if you want this plugin.",
    "Yeah, the links.",
    "The link is below in the description and don't forget to use the coupon if you want to get it, but I like it a lot.",
    "I bought it before the.",
    "Photoshop version was updated.",
    "To have.",
    "Before it was updated to have the triangle, I prefer that.",
    "I'm going to go into some darker colors right at this.",
    "Area where the water and the land meet up.",
    "There's a bit of like a muddy area and I don't want everybody don't want to have is muddy colors, but I do want it to look like mud, so that's kind of puzzle, but we've got some darker shadows and what I tend to like to do is stick to like purple and blue in shadows when I'm painting, especially if it's this kind of environment with a lot of Blues and greens.",
    "So.",
    "Let's try this.",
    "So again, I'm going for a watercolor kind of look.",
    "So far I've been painting all in one layer.",
    "I will not that smart, but.",
    "I like to paint.",
    "I generally like to paint a midtones first.",
    "So I've been trying to remember, you know, hey you need to do some kind of need to start light and then go darker.",
    "Ahmed the how I pinned this image on the top.",
    "It's something separate from photo shop.",
    "It's a separate app that you can download and the link to it is also below a stream in the description it's called pure ref.",
    "PUREREF and it is free to download.",
    "I think you can make a donation if you like when you download it, which is nice.",
    "But yeah, the link is below the stream and it's very handy.",
    "I use it all the time.",
    "You do have to go into the settings and make sure that you select in the settings for it to put the window always on top.",
    "Once you select that then it will do that, but the default won't put the window on top and let's you go in there and tell it to do that.",
    "But then you're good to go.",
    "So we're getting into or maybe getting into the messy stage now.",
    "Usually when a painting feels like this to me, it's generally because I've started to paint in darker values or started to do something with the value structure.",
    "So putting in shading.",
    "Where I haven't yet added shading everywhere.",
    "Usually that's one of the main things that I notice whenever I feel like my paintings in that ugly stage.",
    "That's usually what's going on, so things that things need to become balanced and right now there.",
    "Not quite balances.",
    "Nothing wrong, you just gotta remember paintings go through a phase and you gotta.",
    "Work, work your way through that hi baby Hi Robert Morning Mattie how's the weather over there in Netherlands?",
    "We had some wonderful storms last night in central UK.",
    "We've been having a pretty good weather right now.",
    "It's like partly cloudy.",
    "There's a bit of sun and.",
    "It's pretty warm, so no complaints.",
    "We've had this these we've had a lot of.",
    "The threat of thunderstorms lately, but then they don't.",
    "Actually, we haven't actually had them like there's been a couple days recently that the weather report was saying we were going to expect.",
    "Really, really stormy weather, but it never came through, which is kind of sad.",
    "'cause I enjoy a good thunderstorm.",
    "Here and there.",
    "But not not so much.",
    "Exactly Judy, that's the same thing.",
    "So I'm still focusing on gradients and blocking in of colors, not individual plants yet.",
    "We're still in that trying to visualize this as if we had taken off our glasses and we're seeing like a blurred version of reality, or still in that phase, and then when everything is finally in place, like when all the basic shadows are in the right spot, then we'll take it to the next level and start actually painting.",
    "Grass is and like little Moss details and things like that.",
    "Can I use it in Adobe XDO pure ref?",
    "So pure ref is?",
    "Is it a separate app?",
    "It's not a plugin, so the cool thing is you can use it with like any program.",
    "You can even have it open a window that says on top of your web browser anything.",
    "It's not necessarily attached.",
    "A photo shop in anyway, I just use it when I paint, so I'm usually using it when I use photo shop, but you can use it with anything.",
    "Hey Claire Z Oh I'm so happy for you then I hope you enjoyed the thunderstorms.",
    "Yeah it's just nice cozy type of whether to stay inside and paint or work on things.",
    "I always enjoy thunderstorms.",
    "Alright, so I just wanted a little bit darker value in the corner here, but I'm trying to find the right color because I want it to be like a deep saturated blue, a green a little bit towards blue.",
    "I don't want a dirty muddy green.",
    "OK, so I think for the first time now we're going to start working on the tree stump.",
    "And it has a very desaturated color.",
    "It's not Brown like a lot of trees, tree stumps that you see.",
    "So we're going to go for this grayish color.",
    "I mean, we could always use some artistic license and paint it differently, but I think it it's nice how it has a contrast to the environment if we go with a Brown color, would then I think it'll blend into the grass a little bit more value wise so will stick with this.",
    "Pamodzi are good to see you.",
    "Oh, you're welcome.",
    "I'm at.",
    "I'm happy it helps.",
    "So on a new layer I'm trying to select a color for this for this would and I tried not color picking from the reference, so sometimes it takes me awhile to figure out what color something is.",
    "If we really can't figure it out.",
    "It's best to just color pick and see what the answer is, so let's see.",
    "Actually wasn't like horribly far off with that last selection.",
    "But basically looks like on the left we have like an off white color that's a little bit warmer, like a yellowish color, and then on the right of the tree stump we've got a Gray that has a little bit of a blue green color.",
    "Can you see that?",
    "So that's what we want to keep in mind.",
    "So there's a couple ways I'm trying to think of what's the best way to paint this in 'cause If I'm going for a watercolor looks then making all these paint strokes I feel like that's just not going to do it.",
    "So I have a something I want to experiment with.",
    "Kind of a hypothesis, so I'm going to make a selection and fill the selection in.",
    "If you use the lasso tool and make a selection your edges around the outside, that selection are going to be pretty hard.",
    "So for example, if I deselect you can see the hard edges around that.",
    "So what you can do is use feathering.",
    "So if I have the last central selected, you can go up here to feather and put a certain number of pixels.",
    "Let's try 5.",
    "I want it to be just a slight softness, so now if you fill this in, do you see how there's sort of this glow effect in the soft edge?",
    "So that's actually more than I was expecting.",
    "Maybe I'll try just a couple pixels.",
    "I want just a little bit of a soft edge.",
    "Let's try, I gotta change this before I select let's try to.",
    "Just make a random shape.",
    "I think I like it.",
    "I think I like it.",
    "OK.",
    "So I'm going to make a selection of my.",
    "Tree stump and.",
    "If you can't be your sketch anymore and you're having trouble making this election, yeah, they can just make this sketch layer more opaque.",
    "God Jackson thank you for noticing the timer.",
    "Cow says Wolf's been working on this.",
    "It's a plugin that he's looking to make available.",
    "But I'm basically the beta tester right now, so this is the first day I'm using it on on stream, but if it's if it all works out well or after we troubleshoot it a bit, it's going to be available.",
    "Yeah, for just it'll be.",
    "It'll be a low low price for it, but it will be available for anyone who is interested in buying it.",
    "But yeah, it would be nice to have a timer that I can use here when I'm streaming on V hands or anytime in photo shop.",
    "It has a stop watch so it will count up or countdown depending on what you look what you like.",
    "Now this is unfortunately I'm recently always working during stream so I can only say hello and goodbye.",
    "Oh, maybe it'll come into the middle, but always listening by the way, colors in the reference super cozy.",
    "Thank you madzia.",
    "I'm glad you can still at least lyric and hang out with us even though you're working.",
    "I hope your work goes well.",
    "And thanks for keeping US company.",
    "I love this reference too.",
    "I hope I can do something nice with it in the painting.",
    "Going to try my best.",
    "I know we are is not amazing.",
    "I know I'm very spoiled.",
    "Really.",
    "OK, so I think we've made the whole selection.",
    "If you guys have been watching me select this.",
    "I've been using shift to add to the selection an alt to subtract from it.",
    "Thanks Claire ZI appreciate that you tried to design it to fit into photo shop so it would be.",
    "Yeah, not distracting and feel like it was part of the.",
    "Feel like as part of the program.",
    "OK, so we've got our selection.",
    "Let me just pop in a color.",
    "This is obviously going to be just one flat colour groups on the new layer and so we've got one flat colour.",
    "and I did this mainly just to have the selection here.",
    "Now we can lock the selection so we've got our shape on the layer.",
    "We can press the checkerboard icon here and then we can paint whatever we want.",
    "It will only allow us to paint within that shape, so I think so.",
    "This is the idea when I.",
    "Sometimes when I paint in watercolor I almost get the feeling that I'm working with clipping masks because you'll create this wet area on the paper and then anything you paint with in that area.",
    "That paint will spread out within that little shape because of the water tension, it won't escape outside of that shape, so I think we can maybe emulate that a little bit with clipping masks or locking the transparency.",
    "I have this shape here an I can paint within it in soft gradients and just keep it within that shape.",
    "Anyway, let's try.",
    "IRS isn't working too.",
    "Sometimes I have to mute, but generally I'm able to follow stream.",
    "Oh, I know the time of day.",
    "For some people it's like right in the middle of birthday.",
    "So I'm sorry, but I'm glad you're still here.",
    "Talk how well done.",
    "Thank you foster.",
    "I will under timer fancy.",
    "Yeah I'm excited for it to be.",
    "Like fully out and shared, but in the mean time I'm testing it.",
    "OK, I will lower the opacity of the sketch layer now because I know that this is in with a lighter flat color.",
    "I can see everything, so will tone that down so it's not distracting and looking at the reference.",
    "So here's my watercolor brush.",
    "And what I'm trying to do is just give.",
    "This gradient of shading.",
    "Within this one, shape and kind of pretend that this is just like one big watercolor wash that's going on here.",
    "So we'll choose a warmer.",
    "Color for some of the shadows, it seems like everything on the left side is just going to have a little bit of these warmer details and on the right we have the colour details then.",
    "Just kind of flow between them.",
    "Um?",
    "Hi, are there.",
    "How are you?",
    "I hope I'm saying your name right.",
    "You can correct me if I'm if I'm not missing anything else.",
    "I'm going to take a peek at my painting in black and white and I'm going to do the same thing with the reference because I'm a little confused with how bright this should be.",
    "So what we will do is take a peek over here oook at that.",
    "OK, so I've just started with this, so it's clearly we have a ways to go, but you can see that in the end I need to get brighter areas in the grass and just a lot more contrast.",
    "Pure F is not free, it is it is you can put.",
    "You can choose to put $0.00 when you download it.",
    "They give you the option to make a donation if you want to, but it's not a requirement.",
    "Yes, they've changed something in like the last week.",
    "It is free, but it's a little it might be a little confusing because they up the donation thing, but you don't have to make a donation.",
    "Yeah, check one more time.",
    "So.",
    "Yeah, we need to.",
    "We need to add more highlights in the grass is.",
    "If you want to turn your painting in a black and white like that, you can set up a shortcut that will do it really easy and it's very useful.",
    "You can go to view proof, setup custom.",
    "So view proof, setup custom and then under the drop down here for proof conditions you just set the device to simulate to working Gray gain 20% just like this from the Dropdown Press it OK and then anytime you press CTRL Y it will turn your painting the black-and-white.",
    "Great thing about this is you can still color pic from the real colors and paint while it's in black and white and then you just go back when you press CTRL.",
    "Why again it will go back to being covered.",
    "Hey you guys, how are you welcome?",
    "Alright, so.",
    "We need to continue on with getting some shadows in the the white part of the tree.",
    "The.",
    "The bark.",
    "I'm trying to be really careful with how dark I go for these shadows because there are a lot of different.",
    "Different shadows and curves that have these sort of dirty looking details in the wood part of the tree, but I want to keep.",
    "I don't want to go very very dark value wise because then suddenly.",
    "We're going to have way too high contrast.",
    "But I think we're on a good path here.",
    "Um, when I can?",
    "I'm looking forward to kind of merging this.",
    "Down onto the layer with all the green and everything I would like to be able to sort of paint freely over this and have have everything on one layer.",
    "Alright, good luck on that.",
    "I hope it works out.",
    "OK, so I think I hope this isn't a mistake, but I'm going to merge it.",
    "I think that I painted everything that I wanted to with the layer separately, like that big wash that I was wanting to do.",
    "So I think now I'll merge it down so this is what we have right now.",
    "This layer and the sketch on top of it, so I'm going to make a new layer in between those.",
    "And.",
    "I want I want to start actually wonder if I can use this much brush here.",
    "I kind of want a softer transition and I'm not sure if sludging or painting on top is the way to go.",
    "Let's try painting on top.",
    "Alright, nice, I'm glad.",
    "I'm glad you got it working.",
    "Yeah, I hope you enjoy it.",
    "See now, having just a little bit of green details coming up in front of the.",
    "The tree stump is making it look a lot more natural and not like it's just pasted in there, but that things are actually growing around it and it's kind of settled in nestled in here.",
    "Alright, let's paint in a little bit of the.",
    "Area near the water.",
    "So we've got some purple ish.",
    "Details, it's just.",
    "There the mud and dirt and Little Twigs.",
    "Next to the water.",
    "I'm looking forward to actually using some hard edges in this.",
    "But I think it's important to kind of move from like a vague softness to more specific.",
    "Um, harder edges.",
    "I think we gotta keep.",
    "Sticking with soft edges first time for a little while longer.",
    "While you merge layers well, there's a couple reasons.",
    "Mainly I merge layers because it helps me get a more traditional style look to my painting.",
    "Part I think part of the reason is just because in traditional art you don't have all these layers available, so kind of having things together puts me more in the mentals they bed.",
    "Yeah, I don't know what it is, but it's I find that I get more in an easy flow when I'm painting because I don't have to select through like let's say I wanted to paint something on top of this tree stump.",
    "So was on a separate layer.",
    "I might have to decide between.",
    "Do I want to erase out of the tree stumps you see thru below it?",
    "I want to paint on a layer on top of it.",
    "do I want to do I need to switch all through all these layers and it just becomes a little bit more complicated when there's less layers.",
    "I feel like I can just paint on top of stuff where I want it to be and I don't have to make so many decisions and sort of weed through different layers and things but.",
    "There's a lot of benefits to keeping things on separate layers as well.",
    "Sometimes things are easier to change.",
    "I'm so sorry I'm expecting something.",
    "I think this is a package I'll be right back.",
    "Sorry about this guys.",
    "Hey guys I'm sorry about that.",
    "Yeah, we were expecting expecting a package.",
    "It's not, it's it's for my boyfriend is not for me.",
    "He got something for set up something for his computer.",
    "I know I have to bring it in math.",
    "Yeah, I already ordered way too many paints recently.",
    "It wasn't me this time I swear.",
    "Anyway, thank you guys.",
    "Um, yeah you can use groups.",
    "There are different ways you can get around if you prefer to keep your layers separate.",
    "It's very much a personal preference thing.",
    "When I'm doing a quick studies, I usually just go ahead and merge things if I'm going to be doing work for a client where they might want me to change things and I want to be safe and know that you know I can easily change things if they ask me too, then I might keep players separate and be more.",
    "A little bit more careful about merging, but it's it's a lot of personal preference.",
    "I'm certainly not saying that everyone needs to work like this.",
    "I know it's kind of A.",
    "Maybe a little unusual.",
    "Compared to a lot of people work.",
    "But I just found it.",
    "It made me a lot faster.",
    "Not worrying about what layer things were on a fishing through them and all that jazz.",
    "OK, so I want to add some Moss.",
    "Harry's new.",
    "So then last has a very bright green.",
    "Saturated look.",
    "And it's these cute little rounded Tufts.",
    "So I'm trying to select a lighter color on the top of these little tough.",
    "This is very bright, but.",
    "That's OK.",
    "Will work with it.",
    "And even a little warm, goldish color.",
    "I think it's nice.",
    "Oh, welcome reach.",
    "New thanks for being here and then then you on high.",
    "I hope from seeing your name OK.",
    "Welcome on in San Jose.",
    "This is the confidence important.",
    "I don't understand what you're asking, I'm sorry.",
    "Are you talking about my painting?",
    "OK, so.",
    "We're going to move into some hard edges soon.",
    "Hi Catherine, how are you?",
    "And I just want to go over any of these bottom edges of the tree stumps that are.",
    "That are hard 'cause I think it looks better if there's little Tufts of grass coming up over the top, and you can have hard edges facing upward.",
    "And that's fine.",
    "Alright, I think I can turn off the sketch layer now, 'cause if you see I think we got everything blocked in that.",
    "Was that the sketch was there to tell us to do?",
    "So I don't really need that anymore, so I'll turn off the schedule later.",
    "Will still keep it there, just in case.",
    "Sometimes I get confused later and I want to go back to my sketch and Remember Remember what my original goal was.",
    "But I think we can turn off that layer for a bit.",
    "So we're getting towards the part that I was looking forward to.",
    "And that is some we're going to be putting in some more details before I do that, I'm going to make a new layer.",
    "So what I'll do is I'll merge down what I have here.",
    "If we really want to, we can duplicate the background layer.",
    "Sometimes I'll do this kind of thing, so I'll save 2 versions.",
    "It's fun if you want to make like a step-by-step sheet later and show your processor process.",
    "Then you can see that stuff.",
    "But will make a new layer.",
    "I'm going to put this layer on, multiply blending mode and use an airbrush, just the basic airbrush and what I want to do here is make my airbrush really large and use it to add some shading.",
    "For example the background I want to be a little bit darker.",
    "How do you put a price on your artwork?",
    "Well, that's a difficult thing.",
    "There's some different things you can take into account for pricing work, so if I'm there's also, how do you price and artwork to sell that you created versus a Commission?",
    "So if you create something you're selling it versus somebody's asking you to paint something specific, that can be different price.",
    "I'm doing good, got some thank you, I uh.",
    "Now you can consider a lot of different things if you're working traditionally, then you of course you need to also consider the cost of materials of the paper and paint and all that.",
    "But either way, if you're doing digital or traditional, you have to look at how many hours you're putting into your work and the difficulty level.",
    "Like if somebody is commissioning you to do a portrait, that's going to be a very different price than a whole environment scene with a battle and multiple characters an all this dynamic.",
    "Action poses and stuff like that, so there's a lot to think about.",
    "Claire, she says put up a random question, but on layers where do you have color, Dodge, etc.",
    "What does divide do?",
    "Sometimes it just feels perfect for what I'm doing, but I have no idea what actually does that's so interesting.",
    "I actually have never used that layer blending mode divide that's so cool.",
    "Maybe I'll try it out more.",
    "I yeah I don't have an answer unfortunately, just because I that's not one that's in my.",
    "My rotation usually I use.",
    "I use color Dodge, multiply, overlay.",
    "I use dark and light and a lot.",
    "But not so much.",
    "Not so much.",
    "Divide dividing your page.",
    "What you know.",
    "I wish it boyfriend was here.",
    "He would know he knows all this scientific information about the layer blending modes.",
    "I'll try to ask him next time that I see him in stream.",
    "He was explaining about the other day to me about.",
    "Overlay and stuff like that.",
    "But I'm sorry I can't be more specific with an answer for you, Sano.",
    "As you get more experienced, you can charge more as well.",
    "It has a lot to do also with your you know the artist skill level and how in demand they are and stuff like that.",
    "Those are those are things that are important too.",
    "But That being said, even a beginner artist, I don't think you should ever under charge for your work.",
    "I don't think you should ever be getting paid less than minimum wage.",
    "For example to do artwork.",
    "That's that.",
    "That's not right and a lot of artists under charge for their work.",
    "I think you got them, I appreciate that.",
    "So we added a little extra shading.",
    "We can also do the same thing with highlights, so I'll make a new layer and put it on color.",
    "Dodge, grab the Airbrush Ann just like we added some shadow.",
    "We can add highlights so I don't know color Dodge is going to be the right choice.",
    "Maybe overlays is better, but basically I want the idea that there's a little bit of light hitting back here.",
    "I think I might.",
    "Kind of change up the lighting a little bit from the reference.",
    "I think that might be fun.",
    "Strange shenanigans, says.",
    "According to Adobe, looks at the color information in each channel and divides the blend color from the base color.",
    "Thank you for looking that up, I am.",
    "I hate that it's like I understand I'm like reading it, but it doesn't.",
    "This still doesn't.",
    "It's not quite know what that means.",
    "I understand like the base color.",
    "Oh, the blend color must be the color of your painting with.",
    "That's very interesting.",
    "Do you think extra brush?",
    "Yes, below my stream in the description you can find some links to my brushes.",
    "So I was thinking about having like a little bit of light pop in the scene over here, but I can't decide if I want to do that or if I want to just keep it like sort of an overcast feeling.",
    "Maybe that's better.",
    "OK, well I'm glad chat knows a little bit about.",
    "About it Thanks you guys.",
    "Alright, so new layer.",
    "And I think now I'm gonna be going into what I would consider being like the Gouache style painting.",
    "So we've done a lot of sort of imitation of watercolor looking paint.",
    "And now I'm going to go in with like a paint.",
    "That's going to look.",
    "I hope a little bit more like a thick opaque medium, so let's add some highlights.",
    "So this part of the.",
    "The tree some.",
    "Is a little bit brighter and the top part is sort of aiming up towards the light, so we'll go over that.",
    "With some await crush.",
    "What kind of work do you do, Gotham?",
    "Do do digital art stuff.",
    "And just like we added highlights, you can also add.",
    "Shadows, little details and texture things like this.",
    "Thank you, thanks Alvis.",
    "That's very kind.",
    "My whole body like goes well and anybody who's painting along with me on this one.",
    "I hope it's going well and you're enjoying it.",
    "I'm going to join this one.",
    "I think I'm starting to get through that initial.",
    "Well, we kind of got through a little bit of an ugly stage there at the beginning when we didn't have any hard edges in the scene, but starting to feel better now.",
    "So what to do but?",
    "Pencil art oh cool, well if you want your welcome supposed like one of your artworks in the chat.",
    "If you want to share with us.",
    "So I'm going to teach you guys like a little trick with painting.",
    "Grass is an foliage and overlapping things.",
    "It's not everything too wild, but it helped me.",
    "OK, the idea is whenever you have areas of shadow or highlight kind of overlapping, that's where you can.",
    "Help show texture and so this is true and foliage, but this is also and you can use this in like painting her or any kind of other things.",
    "So that it says some multi use multipurpose technique.",
    "Hey bill, good to see you.",
    "My gosh, how are you finally got the computer setup?",
    "Awesome.",
    "Um?",
    "We are we're doing like a little watercolor, gouache ish.",
    "And study today.",
    "Well I'm enjoying it.",
    "OK, Sandy, that's the most important thing.",
    "Don't worry about the results.",
    "We are learning.",
    "Not sure it's even close to decent.",
    "This one is tricky.",
    "The values are tricky, but here this is what I was going to show you guys.",
    "If you want to put little grass is instead of just coming in.",
    "He ran randomly starting with putting lighter gases.",
    "Consider instead anywhere that you have overlapping from one color to the next.",
    "That's an opportunity.",
    "To show the grass is more easily so this lighter color coming up over the darker background, just as this darker color comes up over the lighter green.",
    "That's kind of where you can.",
    "Show off your your grass is in your texture and will really show up a more and I want to add in a little bit of like a teal.",
    "Color back here.",
    "There's some kind of light glow thing.",
    "But I hope I hope that helps.",
    "That's what I'm going to be doing.",
    "Here.",
    "And maybe you have a brush that will let you do multiple.",
    "Grass is at one time like there's some kind of hair brush or rake brush.",
    "Things like that.",
    "I wonder if I have any handy.",
    "I have some brushes that do this kind of thing and that would be, you know, I like this kind of style.",
    "Doesn't necessarily fit in exactly with what I was doing up to this point, but we could try something like that too.",
    "So.",
    "And get rid of those.",
    "Yeah we have a rake brush and this kind of thing.",
    "So when you get multiple little strands.",
    "Still, in the ugly stages, yeah, this one had a bit of a tough stage.",
    "One thing that really helps me out that, as mentioned earlier, was like turning the painting in the black and white.",
    "So don't forget to do that if you're feeling stuck, turn the painting and the reference into black and white and see what you think.",
    "Alright, I'm kind of all over the place trying to decide really what style to finish this.",
    "Then it would be a lot faster if I allowed myself to come in with these types of brushes, but I don't want to take away from the style and going for so I will be sparing with them.",
    "My technique, thank you.",
    "Thanks you guys.",
    "Well, just the sneak in.",
    "A little bit more work with this brush.",
    "This is something that I use a lot in this kind of style.",
    "My gouache, painting terraces, so good studios, a work in progress.",
    "An awful dongle, but I have the new sit stand desk.",
    "Oh cool standing desk so it's a desk that can be adjusted to sit or stand.",
    "That's awesome.",
    "Try to do some digital work for longer period of time.",
    "I've been really good things we miss you too.",
    "I've been getting a lot of inspiration lately, which is nice.",
    "I've been getting really into watercolor as inspiring my digital work too.",
    "As you can see here.",
    "I'm kind of trying to bring some watercolor techniques in.",
    "But yeah, I've been good.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Busy but good.",
    "So trying to bring some fun colors up here in the corner.",
    "And I'm using a smudge brush to blend in some of those edges, 'cause again I do want it to feel like a water medium and not like oil or something.",
    "So I'm trying to get a feeling of soft edges here and there.",
    "Things blending together.",
    "I don't know.",
    "I'm not working.",
    "Trying to add these little rounded looking Tufts.",
    "Kind of cheerful grass is again going for like sort of give me ish by 5 so.",
    "Try keep that in mind.",
    "Looking for a brush.",
    "Alright, so let's continue with the individual.",
    "Grass is so new layer and we're going to go back to what I was talking about a little bit ago.",
    "And adding the grass is in areas of overlap.",
    "So let this lighter teal and latest light green color here is overlapping the background.",
    "And then got the darker, medium, medium, green, medium color.",
    "What color hype about tuning pal Saturday so addictive is great.",
    "Sound like the same person I thought.",
    "Yeah I've got a couple of new new sets and it's nice to test them out and compare a little bit different brands and get a feeling for what you like, but I'm definitely really enjoying it.",
    "So now we're going one layer darker.",
    "And these darker.",
    "Um graph is will come up in front of the medium green ones, so I have to admit this is a bit time consuming.",
    "But part of what I learned when you're trying to get a traditional kind of look to your digital painting, one of the things that really helps is just kind of painting at the same way, and sometimes with the digital.",
    "I look for a lot of shortcuts because there are shortcuts to be had, and it's a great thing about this medium.",
    "But sometimes if you take the time to kind of do something the long way, you can get a different result.",
    "And sometimes it can be really nice.",
    "So up here.",
    "That lighter, lighter green.",
    "One thing that I'm looking forward to is adding some.",
    "Blue greenish bounce light.",
    "That's one of my favorite things with these kind of settings.",
    "Let me take a look.",
    "At time we got about an hour and a half left at most.",
    "Of course you guys are welcome to continue on if you're working on this one and you need more time, don't feel like you have to be on the same exact schedule as mean you can if you want to, but I'm going to paint another one after this, and you're welcome to continue on with this one if you're enjoying it, or if you want to take it further.",
    "I'm going to flip the reference and flip my painting.",
    "I don't think I've done this yet, which is kind of crazy.",
    "'cause usually I try to do that.",
    "Earlier on, so definitely have some things I want to dark in.",
    "This area up here.",
    "Flat brush.",
    "And this.",
    "Lush green comes back behind here.",
    "So I'm looking for the areas of Hiest.",
    "Contrast where the highest contrast is an the darkest shadows.",
    "So if you look at the reference.",
    "I feel like here there's a lot of contrast of dark shadows, but also under here and back here and that high contrast around those areas really helps determine that that's the area that like grabs RI, so we need these really dark areas, and then I usually do highlights last, so I'll be coming in soon with a brighter colors, but it's easier to paint the bright colors coming out of the shadows.",
    "Than vice versa, so usually do darker colors first.",
    "Right, I can't wait at the bounce light so satisfying.",
    "I'm trying to figure out what to do with.",
    "The.",
    "Shadows on the actual would.",
    "Feel like I didn't go dark enough on the right.",
    "Have so much caffeine today.",
    "If you come on another planet.",
    "OK jealous.",
    "I'm drinking some tea.",
    "And it's very good.",
    "But I don't have quite as much energy as you at the moment.",
    "Fighting good.",
    "We're having a relaxing time over here.",
    "Alright so I will create another step.",
    "So far we've this was the first snapshot that I took.",
    "Too bad I didn't save the earlier versions, but we can kind of look through here and see.",
    "It's like the plants are growing.",
    "Alright, so what's next?",
    "Let's keep going with the grass is.",
    "I think with the grass isn't things.",
    "It's kind of similar to her where you want to group them up.",
    "Ideally if you have one area that just has a ton of little individual, tiny, tiny little graph is and that all chaotic and random.",
    "I don't think it's quite as satisfying as if you kind group things up just a little bit, and so how do you do that?",
    "Look in the reference and try to simplify where you can, like for example.",
    "Let me show you where I might think about that.",
    "So you could maybe make a group out of this area, see how that's all lighter?",
    "This area would be a better example I think right here.",
    "So you could kind of do something like.",
    "Like this as one Group One tuft.",
    "And this over here.",
    "So that's what I'm going to do.",
    "In my version is try find areas to group up so that it's not just tons of individual grass is that are doing their stuff.",
    "I think his plans don't really work that way either.",
    "Usually you have like a center area where the graph stuff is growing out of.",
    "Coffee just keeps me awake.",
    "Sadly never gives energy.",
    "Odd that's frustrating.",
    "I have.",
    "I have.",
    "I got a little bit sometimes, many like if I had coffee only gives me so much energy.",
    "It's like it.",
    "I feel like I do love it.",
    "But I tried to stop drinking at a certain point in the day because it will keep me awake at night.",
    "Thank you are mad.",
    "I appreciate those being here and hang out.",
    "So let's add some little little bit more.",
    "Uh.",
    "Moss Here and we can add some that doesn't necessarily exist in the reference.",
    "You know if we think it'll cool, we can Add all kinds of stuff.",
    "Oh yeah, Speaking of adding stuff, I was going to add mushrooms, let me turn my sketch layer.",
    "Bacana ha.",
    "I almost forgot about them.",
    "So let's let's try to paint these in, so I'm going to make a selection.",
    "Actually, I'm going to turn of- feathering.",
    "But that to zero pixels so that we can make a selection will be a nice hard edge.",
    "So I'm going to make selection tracing around my mushroom shape from the sketch and then let us turn the scheduler back off if I can find it there go and.",
    "Make a new layer and Poppin.",
    "Solid color for the mushrooms.",
    "Have to add in bounce light and exciting features early on, otherwise I get too impatient and ruin it.",
    "Rushed the fun bits and it's honestly it's not a bad idea.",
    "I feel like sometimes I try to wait too long so I'm like saving the best thing for last kind of thing.",
    "But then you end up not visualizing everything together as a whole throughout the painting process.",
    "So.",
    "Yarra Oh my gosh, I was so happy if you think so that's really what I was trying to go for.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Thank you, thank you.",
    "So I'm going to pretend well these were going to go with like these are just regular white mushrooms with maybe a little bit darker detail to them so.",
    "Will just.",
    "Make some pretty casual mushrooms.",
    "I'm kind of make them the same.",
    "Color scheme as the.",
    "The word here.",
    "So yeah, color picking from my own.",
    "Tree kind of get this on the same page.",
    "Let's flip this.",
    "I'm also going to turn the painting into black-and-white because we've got to make sense of the lighting here.",
    "I'm going to make a new layer and create a clipping mask on to the mushrooms.",
    "I'm going to take an airbrush.",
    "And just shade like this.",
    "Under the mushrooms.",
    "So we turn it back into color.",
    "That's what we've got.",
    "Hey bro, I'm good thanks.",
    "Um, at the large says, what's your take on?",
    "Procreate on iPad?",
    "Would you consider it a production ready software?",
    "Uhm, I would say it could be, but not for me.",
    "I've seen artists use it in professional work, but I have an iPad with procreate and I also have a PC with photo shop Ann.",
    "I well it's fun to use the iPad when I'm like sitting on the couch and doing a little sketch or something.",
    "I don't feel like I can use procreate or my iPad for doing like the highest level of work that I can do.",
    "If I'm doing client work, it's always going to be on my PC in photo shop where I have like all of the.",
    "Options that I have available to like edit things and use.",
    "Yeah, use all the image editing tools as well as the painting tools and just at a more stable work place and things like that.",
    "That's just my.",
    "That's just my personal opinion, because Yeah, one person and there's a lot of people that are, you know, use all different kinds of.",
    "Different kinds of tools, but for me between the two.",
    "Yeah, I.",
    "I prefer photo shop.",
    "So then the lovely greens and mushrooms Bank Foster.",
    "I can't leave, almost forgot them.",
    "Oh, when you say I'm not in your accent, I feel like I have to do.",
    "History new you like it now?",
    "That's funny.",
    "I'm sorry if I'm saying You're wrong, but I'm happy you're feeling inspired.",
    "Paris is I'm so torn right now.",
    "I really want to paint, but I'm surrounded by stuff I should really put away.",
    "Yeah, paint.",
    "Being a bad influence on you.",
    "About you know.",
    "But you gotta roll that inspiration when it comes sometimes.",
    "OK, back to my other brush.",
    "All of these have some mushrooms.",
    "in Dutch we call those else affair.",
    "Revenge is I didn't know that.",
    "I can't believe I didn't know that you are thank you for telling me that that's wonderful.",
    "That's exactly what they are.",
    "Very little, very benches.",
    "That was a fairy.",
    "I would sit right there 100%.",
    "Alright, so I'm adding some darker little grooves in the Woods.",
    "The tree bark.",
    "It's been fun to try this kind of stylized version.",
    "Let's add a highlight, so anything on the left side of any of the objects in the picture, it's going to get a little bit more.",
    "Rim lay or bright lakes that square.",
    "Light source is coming from.",
    "So this kind of thing.",
    "Yeah, we can flip the canvas to just double check how things are looking from this side.",
    "So want any surprises?",
    "I'm doing good pro designer.",
    "I hope you're having a good day.",
    "Right, crazy.",
    "Alright, so I'm urging down every time I do like a good amount of updates.",
    "Um?",
    "Timers down.",
    "So we can kind of commit to them.",
    "Certainly going to continue on with the overlapping shadows and highlights of grass is over here on the left and we're finally coming up to a point where we're going to be putting some.",
    "Grass is coming up in front of the tree.",
    "That's what I've been waiting on, so I wanted to paint everything with the tree first.",
    "Nice.",
    "Alright, I will do this on a separate layer, just in case.",
    "So here we go.",
    "Got all these grass is coming up here.",
    "Let's flip it so it can be the same point of view as the reference.",
    "Thanks, I'm a good luck with your work, but hope it goes well.",
    "There we go.",
    "That's the color was looking for that's better.",
    "Remember, we're talking about little individual tough, so there's one right there, so putting a little group of grass is rather than just random ones, all equally distant from each other and make some groups.",
    "And we're starting with, like the midtones.",
    "We're going to add highlights.",
    "I'm trying to be a little bit looser.",
    "Sometimes the grass is can be really messy and not all be perfectly perfectly straight.",
    "Sometimes we can have curves, then bends and things.",
    "So let's try some brighter greens going to color pic down here.",
    "Let's move a little bit towards yellow.",
    "Want to be pretty brave.",
    "Sometimes.",
    "So now on the left side of the little tough we need we can add some highlights 'cause Everything's getting highlights on the left.",
    "Oh sorry Sandy, let me get this out of the way.",
    "I don't even need that right now.",
    "An hour and 14 minutes.",
    "Finally got some of your pictures framed.",
    "Will send along soon as I get them on the wall.",
    "That's so exciting.",
    "Oh I'm excited to see them with the frames and everything.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Thank you Val.",
    "I hope this is not going to be a mistake, but I'm going to merge these so even the grass is that come in front of the.",
    "The tree stump were going to merge all right.",
    "Let's start with some bounce light effects on little grass is up here, so I guess we basically add more grass is first, but what I'm talking about is if you look at the reference, there's like a little bit of a turquoise reflection that you see on some of the grass is especially within the shadow areas.",
    "And that is a very pretty satisfying effect.",
    "One of my favorite things when I'm painting foliage.",
    "Really proud.",
    "I didn't plan it out, but my phone could happen.",
    "So now will.",
    "Color pic from what's here and then?",
    "Let's move a little bit more towards blue and a little bit brighter, more saturated, and let's see what we get.",
    "All right.",
    "So this is not the right color.",
    "Let's go more saturated, brighter and more towards the green.",
    "We're getting there back towards blue so I don't color pic from the reference.",
    "Most of the time I try to do this and you can see that sometimes it takes awhile.",
    "I think that is getting closer.",
    "I have an idea.",
    "Let's color pic from the reference and see if we're even close.",
    "So this is the color I'm going for it.",
    "They use little things here.",
    "So I actually picked a color that was more a little bit more intense, but it's all relative, you know so.",
    "If I come, yeah, I think it'll work.",
    "We can use that color.",
    "But anyway, so we can do these little little curves like this.",
    "And it supposed to look like little highlights on grass is, and we don't even necessarily need.",
    "You don't need to make the whole piece of graph.",
    "You can just kind of add these in.",
    "And they just give that overall look and you can go with a darker version 2.",
    "And later version blue or version.",
    "Add a little extra tuft group over here.",
    "Look with a brighter green and then like this.",
    "So.",
    "So it's been kind of A.",
    "This has been a lot of paint strokes in this image.",
    "If I was going for a different style, I could certainly have painted this more easily with brushes, but like if I didn't make so many individual grass is probably could've made this a little bit easier.",
    "Hi baby girl, how are you?",
    "There's also some yellow stands over here.",
    "So I think I like how it's turning out.",
    "I think it's time to turn the image into black and white and do the same thing with our reference and do another values check.",
    "So here is my painting and here's the reference.",
    "I'm going to show it in a moment.",
    "There we go so you can see things are different.",
    "There's more shadows in line, which I don't.",
    "Mind in this area 'cause I feel like maybe it gives a little bit more depth, but we do need to kind of come over some of these dark areas and add more grass isn't kind of blend them in 'cause it's a bit stark right there.",
    "So let's do that.",
    "So there is a.",
    "Little branch that I didn't add in yet and I got it comes down here like this.",
    "So we can add that little detail.",
    "Is this a couple other things like that?",
    "Apparently there's also water down here.",
    "So I want a more subtle transition between the.",
    "The muddy areas in the grass.",
    "I'm not quite sure how to do that, but I think what I'm going to do is add a little patches here, but it looks like you're seeing photographs too.",
    "Muddy areas and just kind of get a more.",
    "The slower.",
    "Transition between them.",
    "I'm doing pretty good Topeka, thank you, thank you.",
    "I'm enjoying the painting any good day.",
    "I did a little bit of watercolor painting before.",
    "Stream today and it got me excited to try this idea.",
    "Of trying to get watercolor gouache feeling with this painting.",
    "I feel like earlier on in the painting it had a little bit more of that effect when I started using the hard edge brush.",
    "I think maybe I lost it a little bit, but.",
    "Still been fun and a cool way to start the painting, something a little different.",
    "I have an idea for the water though.",
    "Let's try it, I'm going to make a selection, so I'm taking the lasso tool.",
    "And I'm just going to select this whole area, grab the Airbrush.",
    "And paint a gradient in the water, because I feel like this is.",
    "Sort of a watercolor like affect.",
    "What's going on in the reference in the water.",
    "The fact that we have this nice gradient and I would imagine maybe this is something we could do a wash to get this kind of effect early on.",
    "And then make a new layer.",
    "And.",
    "We've got these reflections.",
    "Of these branches, and.",
    "We do things.",
    "So I'm going to make a selection with the lasso, so I'm going to get some sharp an interesting shapes, I hope.",
    "And then we're going to fill this in with the gradient.",
    "Alright, so let's see how that looks.",
    "Let me try this.",
    "So I can choose my watercolor, my brush that's trying to imitate watercolor.",
    "And let's choose a dark blue purple color.",
    "And fill that in.",
    "My brush might be too much, might be just making it a solid color.",
    "I can try just going with the Airbrush then.",
    "You got too much.",
    "All right?",
    "So.",
    "Go to edit, transform, skew.",
    "And mess with my shape that I made a little bit.",
    "It's OK.",
    "Mine is a bit off from the reference, but I think it's OK.",
    "I'm going to put it on multiply mode and lower the Opacity will try that.",
    "I think that's maybe a little closer.",
    "I was going for.",
    "And let's try it.",
    "I'm going to take a smudge brush and smudge.",
    "A little bit of that, so hopefully that's going to help give.",
    "That water kind of effect and will merge those down.",
    "I think I like it.",
    "Needs some painting over and need some painting over kind of watercolor paper texture be applied after the painting is complete.",
    "Yes yes it can and that would be a cool effect.",
    "I actually.",
    "Have something I could use and try that?",
    "Um?",
    "Let me see if I can find the file was thinking of.",
    "So I have a watercolor paper texture.",
    "That I got from a tutorial.",
    "It was actually Skillshare tutorial of an artist, Cat Coke.",
    "And I'll share the name.",
    "I'll share her website in the chat if you want to look her up.",
    "She's got Photoshop tutorials and stuff like that so that Photoshop tutorials and digital tutorials an good tutorials on digitising your traditional work and stuff like that.",
    "I took one pro tutorials awhile back and it came.",
    "She included a bunch of paper textures and things that was really cool, so this is like a cold pressed watercolor paper type of texture.",
    "And it's pretty big, so should be no problem.",
    "Yeah, it's actually kind of ginormous.",
    "Hold on Oh my God.",
    "Yeah, we can make this smaller.",
    "Want to make sure that the texture size of the paper like makes sense to the?",
    "Paper you're working on.",
    "That little bumps.",
    "Alright, I think that's pretty good.",
    "Hello into W.",
    "So we have this paper texture and what I would usually uses multiply mode, especially if it's really bright.",
    "Yeah, multiply, I think would be the best and you could lower the opacity, but you can see what it does.",
    "If I turn it, if I put this.",
    "On an off.",
    "It does darken the image a little bit more, but we could also brighten it back up to kind of counter that.",
    "Um?",
    "Yeah, if we try overlay it makes things really bright.",
    "But I think I think multiply is a nice way to apply that.",
    "Yeah, and it definitely does to me.",
    "It definitely does make it look more traditional to add that texture.",
    "That paper textures, that's something.",
    "So you can scan your own paper or find textures on line.",
    "I started scanning some of my own textures recently when I was experimenting with making my own brushes.",
    "I've gotta brush that I'm working on, and I scanned a bunch of canvas textures and different things like that.",
    "Hey there vinayak welcome.",
    "Welcome welcome.",
    "We've got about an hour left on this painting, and I think that's a good amount of time to be able to Polish it up.",
    "And.",
    "I will try to get something nice and finished feeling by the end of that.",
    "Yeah, yeah Jackson, I think what I had done was I signed.",
    "She actually offered like the two free months of Skillshare.",
    "I don't know if you still have that on our website or on her socials, but.",
    "Her courses on Skillshare really good and they give a lot of cool like assets with them like that.",
    "If anybody is just joining us, feel free to ask me any questions.",
    "What I've been doing is attempting a watercolor and Gouache style digital painting, so I'm kind of taking inspiration from Studio Ghibli kind of style going for those textures.",
    "An experimenting with different ways to make it look like that.",
    "If you want to check out the reference images that I'm using, they are below the stream in the description and above the chat.",
    "In the info tab, there's a link to them there to an.",
    "Anybody is welcome to join in if you want to do a little study or.",
    "Sketcher painting of any of the images that I'm working on today.",
    "You can join in.",
    "I like to do study streams.",
    "So I do my studies and we kind of do only the group is a little bit more fun.",
    "There's something weird going on here.",
    "I you guys probably notice this already, but I kind of changed up the, uh.",
    "Arrangement of the roots.",
    "I didn't paint them all exactly as they actually are.",
    "And sometimes when you change things up from the reference, it works out great and other times you can run into little.",
    "Little situations.",
    "So I'm trying to fix it up now.",
    "Is your scanner?",
    "Info in your twitch panels.",
    "I've been looking at get a scanner for scanning in some old sketches I don't remember.",
    "I think I put it there.",
    "I can't remember if I had to move it because I was running out of space in the links there it might be there.",
    "If not I'll find the info for you later.",
    "It's a actually hold on.",
    "I could probably think of probably find out right now.",
    "OK, it's a Canon LIDE 220 Canon LIDE 220.",
    "There may be a link.",
    "In my panels, what's your favorite Ghibli?",
    "Hum, probably howl's moving Castle.",
    "That movie just has a special place in my heart.",
    "I love the music.",
    "I love the movie.",
    "I watched it with my mom and my sister a million times.",
    "So we're very like attached to it.",
    "That's probably my favorite.",
    "There are still movies I haven't seen.",
    "There's a whole bunch of Ghibli films, and for as much of a fan I am.",
    "I should really go on a binge watch session and see all the ones I haven't seen.",
    "What about you?",
    "Do you have a favorite?",
    "I wouldn't mind doing some fan art sometime.",
    "I've done a couple studies, kind of recreating an actual screenshot from from the movies.",
    "We did one the secret world of Arieti.",
    "And that one was.",
    "Yeah, that's one of my favorite scenes.",
    "That environment that.",
    "Google how some distance and everything.",
    "Alright, definitely better.",
    "So we're going back in time here.",
    "This is the progress.",
    "So we're getting there.",
    "Um?",
    "I do overall like that scanner, they'll it's.",
    "It's pretty good.",
    "I do have to sometimes like color correct things after I scan it, but I don't know if that has something to do with my settings, but often times when I scan things it'll be a little bit little bit washed out to the original, but all the information is there.",
    "It's just I have to kind of look up the brightness and saturation and photo shop to make it look like the.",
    "The original.",
    "You 20 strange genetic instance, Princess Mononoke air spirited away from me.",
    "Princess Mononoke with my first give me film that I saw an I was scared I was I was really pretty young when I saw that movie an I was I thought it was very it had some really creepy parts but it's really cool.",
    "I should watch that movie again.",
    "It's been a long time.",
    "Prefer the flip to the original, that's funny.",
    "Yeah, I think I think I might agree with you.",
    "It's so weird when that happens 'cause the first time I flipped it, I was like, oh.",
    "The first time I flipped it, I did not like it, but I guess we improve things.",
    "Now I kind of like the flip 12.",
    "Oil sketch using white, blue and yellow Soho student grade pains.",
    "Let's see it.",
    "Oh cool, check this out you guys.",
    "This is Lee Art in the chat.",
    "Did a traditional sketch of the one we're working on right now.",
    "Using student grade oil paints.",
    "It's so interesting what you can do with a minimal palette like that.",
    "Like you can still absolutely read what this is even though.",
    "The colors are not like the reference.",
    "They're not like reality.",
    "Always some adjustments after scanning.",
    "Yeah exactly.",
    "I don't think you can get away around that.",
    "I think that's pretty normal.",
    "Blue, White and yellow.",
    "I have maybe a stupid question.",
    "We are 'cause I don't use oil paint.",
    "I haven't yet.",
    "I'm I'm curious that you didn't end up getting green here even though you were using yellow and blue, and it seems to be blending together a bit as surprised that ended up looking so looking more like Brown then.",
    "Green Is that something to do with the pains or is it like the color temperature?",
    "Either way, I like your sketch.",
    "Thank you for sharing and things for painting with us.",
    "I'm just curious about the color mixing.",
    "Alright buddy, some darker.",
    "Grass is.",
    "In the corner I just wanted to pay attention to the values because that has a lot to do with, like the weight.",
    "The.",
    "The things feel balanced, then there's enough weight over here in the corner.",
    "It was a red shade blue, OK, cool, that makes sense.",
    "So I went more towards Brown.",
    "Mix with the yellow came sort of money Yeah, but has a cool mood.",
    "It worked out in your painting.",
    "Alright, I'm going to make a new layer.",
    "'cause we're making new layer every so often.",
    "After we had certain adjustments.",
    "Additive versus subtractive color mixing.",
    "I need to look into that.",
    "Alright, so I'm choosing a lighter color were really getting into.",
    "Some highlights now.",
    "I'm thinking even a lighter color for the grass is an.",
    "Adding some soft ones.",
    "There's a little branch over here in the background.",
    "I'm not sure if it would be nice to add it in.",
    "I think perhaps it would be.",
    "There's a little.",
    "A little plant growing over here.",
    "And maybe it's something going on over there also kind of points back in towards or focal area.",
    "This isn't in the camp that believes using a very limited color palette makes a painting more cohesive.",
    "I think there's something to that.",
    "I would definitely agree with that.",
    "That said, I generally enjoy painting with.",
    "I like the freedom of having any of the colors that I want, but I do agree what you're saying about cohesiveness and limited palette.",
    "It's definitely definitely true.",
    "Definitely helps.",
    "I feel like sometimes I end up creating limited palette.",
    "Almost inadvertently, because my preferences will be towards certain colors.",
    "And that's kind of how I like to do it, because I don't really like to go into a painting being like, Oh, I can only use these, these and these.",
    "Hi mother ship, thank you.",
    "Thank you, thank you.",
    "We can try adding some bright green leaves up here.",
    "Some that might be to Braid Well, let's just try it.",
    "Pretty intense.",
    "Looking great thank you cereal.",
    "Yeah, maybe.",
    "Some little Tufts of leaves.",
    "Let's flip.",
    "I think I like it.",
    "We could also move it around, so let me just select this on to its own layer.",
    "I probably should have painted on its own layer from the start, but.",
    "No problem, we can move this over a bit.",
    "Potentially or twisted points even more dramatically in I think.",
    "I think I like it like that, so just a little bit more over.",
    "So we got a cute little branch.",
    "I like it.",
    "What else can we add?",
    "I think it had more little leaves.",
    "Like they could be some plants that we don't see the full plant, but we see little a little leaf popping up here and there.",
    "I think that'll make this look more lush.",
    "Was not just grass, but there's little little plants.",
    "The best stylized kind of thing.",
    "And that could be up here too.",
    "Maybe there's A.",
    "May be back here is a Bush.",
    "OK, in the shadows, so there's little leaves and stuff every now.",
    "Substr Act, but we could kind of make something of this.",
    "The only thing I'm worried about is getting too detailed with the background, 'cause then we might miss out on that whole.",
    "Soft.",
    "Feed feed into the softness.",
    "I'm using this much brush to smudge away some areas like these hard edges in the water.",
    "I will just keep going.",
    "So we need more grass is coming up in front of the roots over here.",
    "In the.",
    "The reference.",
    "But I think it would look nice.",
    "Just making a little bit of horizontal kind of disruption in the area.",
    "Hi Igor, I have been selecting my own colors though a couple of times when I got stuck I color picking the reference to check.",
    "The colour and see how far I off I was or what the difference was between mine.",
    "I've been trying to paint without color picking because I'm trying to just improve my ability to look at a color.",
    "An guess kind of figure out what color it is.",
    "That's really helped speed up my painting.",
    "Not needing to color pic, although sometimes you know sometimes you gotta.",
    "You gotta check also, it's fine to color pic if that's faster and how you prefer to work.",
    "There's all kinds of workflows.",
    "Hey Ryan.",
    "What roles downstairs, alone or in pairs and over your neighborhood dog?",
    "It's stump?",
    "Now some painting, thank you.",
    "Thank you very much, appreciate it.",
    "Yeah.",
    "It's like a magical tree.",
    "Stuff with mushrooms kind of painting.",
    "Not taking a lot of pictures of this kind of thing, this isn't my Photo by the way, though this is.",
    "You can find a link below stream to the post to the photographers post.",
    "Who created this?",
    "He took this picture.",
    "But if you have a lot of kind of similar images last year in the autumn we had so many mushrooms in the forest, I was really excited.",
    "Took a lot of pictures.",
    "And add some more little cracks in the.",
    "And over here.",
    "I didn't want to lose the brightness.",
    "You know, we don't want to lose the contrast, but I don't think we're in danger of that.",
    "Anymore.",
    "And I think it would look nicer.",
    "That's more details.",
    "It's an old man instantly.",
    "OK.",
    "If those of you who have been painting along, I hope.",
    "I hope you're enjoying it.",
    "I'm going to go into some kind of finishing touches here for this one.",
    "So let's try that.",
    "Hi Sean, thank you.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Welcome.",
    "So what I would do to kind of finish this up?",
    "By the way, here's some of the past steps that we've done.",
    "To get to hear.",
    "Got a little busy between these two.",
    "Alright, so knew layer.",
    "I'm going to put this layer on multiplying and grab the Airbrush.",
    "The reference image has a bit of net kind of effect, so we can imitate that if we like it, you know you just make a really big airbrush.",
    "And kind of choose the dark.",
    "I chose a dark blue.",
    "And just going around the outside here, so this is before and after, before and after.",
    "I think it's a bit extreme so we can do is either race out a bit.",
    "Or do both lower the opacity a little bit, but I like a little bit of that.",
    "Atmosphere is very Ghibli Esque.",
    "Yes, Hey Makaveli, welcome.",
    "We just kind of finishing out the first.",
    "First exercise, here I'm going to be painting another one after this.",
    "I want to look at some things.",
    "Let's look in black-and-white.",
    "Let's look at the values can make an adjustment layer so under the layers palette, let me show it this is so down here at the bottom of the layers palette.",
    "Oh, the tool capture wasn't an oops, let's add that at least it'll be there for the next one.",
    "OK, we're going to grab levels.",
    "And so I pressed the half circle icon down here, went to levels and you can kind of play with how dark the shadows, midtones, and highlights are.",
    "And sometimes this can be.",
    "Helpful for changing contrast and things like that in your image.",
    "Thank you thanks we are.",
    "Another fun thing to mess with is color balance.",
    "You can kind of so again go to the half circle icons like the color balance and you can go through The Shadows, Midtones and highlights.",
    "And for each of those things, you can kind of huge shift a little bit.",
    "So for example, if we want to go more towards blue in the shadows, blue, purple in the shadows, I always like that look.",
    "I will see Midtones.",
    "Maybe we could go also towards blue or maybe green.",
    "But you can see how much that you can change the mood.",
    "I mean, you can really make it more sunny.",
    "Almost night time.",
    "So crazy.",
    "And let's look at highlights can go warm, highlights any highlights, cool highlights.",
    "Alright, let's close this.",
    "So let's look at before and after, before and after is really not that huge of a difference.",
    "I don't even.",
    "I hope you guys can even see it before after it's a little bit warmer, especially on the.",
    "That recent I think I like it.",
    "So I'm going to also go to selective color and this is one of my favorite things to mess with.",
    "So opening up selective color and then we can click through all the different colors, red yellows, greens.",
    "I mean it's crazy.",
    "You can within that color range.",
    "You can then also mess with like how saturated the color is.",
    "Do we want to be more green?",
    "Yes, we do always want to be more green.",
    "Um?",
    "Cat lights and darks.",
    "It's crazy so that was the magenta.",
    "Do we want it to be more yellow, green or more blue green?",
    "You can also mask away parts of this so if you only want it to affect part you can.",
    "Brighter or darker do not the greens brighter or darker.",
    "I kind of like them a little bit brighter.",
    "So let's see before after 4 after.",
    "So what I can do is if I want to kind of preserve those shadow areas being darker, I can just paint.",
    "You see I'm painting with black.",
    "And then it kind of Max away and it only adds the adjustment in the areas that are not masked.",
    "Thank you, Judy.",
    "Thank you makaveli.",
    "I really appreciate it.",
    "This was a big experiment 'cause I was trying to go for like that.",
    "A watercolor gouache ish look and I think some things worked out.",
    "And some things, maybe it's not that it looks bad, it just some things that you couldn't get it quite the look I was going for, but I think overall I like this and I'm going to keep the experiment going on the next one.",
    "Will see if I can apply some things from this one.",
    "I want to try let's look at the yellows so the Little Marcy areas there that's picking them up as being yellow if we want we can push them even more towards yellow or we can keep them more green.",
    "It sometimes it can be a little overwhelming to have all these options 'cause you can feel like you need to change all these things and you really don't need to and you don't need to get even get into this if you don't want to.",
    "Let's try science.",
    "So in the top left corner you can see we can totally desaturate that, or we can just go for it.",
    "I like I like that color and I like the blue green effect so.",
    "Going to bump it up a little bit.",
    "This is before, after, before after.",
    "Yeah, I definitely like after better.",
    "So let me get really quick duplicate.",
    "So this is the before and this is after of all the adjustments before after, so it's definitely more.",
    "You know Bray saturated some of the colors have been shifted, but this is, you know, the polishing page.",
    "So this is where it goes from.",
    "You know, this is where we kind of make it.",
    "Like it's ready.",
    "Another thing I might want to do is let's look at brightness and contrast.",
    "I think I might like more contrast around the area of the stumps, So what I'm going to do is up the brightness and contrast, but I'm going to go back with the black color and mask away.",
    "Other areas that painting 'cause I don't want the whole painting to be this insane contrast, but you can see that I just I just like that area to get a little burst of it so we can paint in anywhere that you do want that contrast we can just add a little bit like this.",
    "You can lower the Opacity That's too much, but I think that's good.",
    "The mosses must never sent.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Um?",
    "Alright, so some final little things.",
    "Usually what I like to do after I do all this is go to image, apply image so you make a new blank layer and then go to image, apply image and then it's going to make a layer that has emerged for merged version of the layers below.",
    "So now I can if I want I can.",
    "Yeah I just like to have this as like my final image.",
    "I see a couple little things I want to do just down here.",
    "These little graph is seem like they.",
    "Start out really stark coming out of the ground, so I'm just going to add a little bit of shadow underneath them.",
    "Think that's almost it.",
    "All right?",
    "So then I will go to filter.",
    "Sharp and I'm just going to sharpen filter it very simple.",
    "It just makes the edge is more a little bit more crisp.",
    "You might not always want this sometimes it can like sort of distort things a little bit, but and if you're going for a very soft look it might not be so nice but.",
    "I'm adding it to sharpen filter.",
    "Up the little pool water by the base of the tree stump could almost be like a little very pool looks so good.",
    "Oh thank you.",
    "Yeah, this is a sweet kind of environment saying I'm glad you guys located.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Um?",
    "Yeah I will.",
    "The last thing is I'm going to go to filter noise, add noise.",
    "This is another reason I do this on a separate layer is because I kind of like the adding a noise filter for posting my work online.",
    "I think I don't know, I just think it looks nice, but if I'm going to be making a print of something or putting it on my web shop for a print, I like to upload a version that does not have the noise filter put onto it.",
    "I I don't know you can go too much with that but.",
    "I think a little bit is nice, so I put a little bit of a noise filter, little bit of sharpening and then yeah, I think we're good.",
    "So let me do the before and after of our finishing effects.",
    "So this is before and this is after before after.",
    "Yeah so.",
    "Some of this back over here.",
    "Get full screen.",
    "Full screen before and after.",
    "For after so, I think it definitely feels more finished.",
    "And it wasn't all that much time to do those extra little things.",
    "So I will save that and there's a little bit under 30 minutes left for anyone who was.",
    "Was following along with my painting on the timer.",
    "I I could add random graph is for 30 minutes, but I think I'm happy enough with it and it might be good to move to the next one 'cause I think the next image might be a little bit more difficult for me because it has some architectural elements in it.",
    "I'm going to take a quick break in between the two paintings, just going to grab a drink and like a little granola bar or something so it'll be a quick quick break, but I'll put on a slide show of some of my other artwork studies if you want to check that out, and if you if you don't mind waiting will start a new painting as soon as they get back.",
    "Let me give you a little preview so this is the image we're going to be painting next again.",
    "Anyone is welcome to join if you want.",
    "I know this one is a bit.",
    "I know this one is a bit tricky.",
    "Sorry for the sorry for the wait, but we're going to be doing streaming for probably another few hours, so I needed to get a little snack before we went on, but I see there was some art sharing, so let me scroll up and chat and see what I missed here.",
    "Also, thank you for all the kind words about my painting.",
    "You guys.",
    "I see the comments.",
    "Jackson let me take a peek.",
    "I know a lot of you guys are probably already looked at these, but I'm going to show them on the screen.",
    "Oh, that is beautiful.",
    "Jackson, I love it.",
    "You absolutely nailed these little Tufts.",
    "That is a really, really nice and this very much feels like that kind of thing that I was going for with the Ghibli style.",
    "These darker areas in the Tufts coming out of it is a nice combination of soft and hard edges, and this feels very in focus.",
    "I like that you kind of accentuated little grass is coming out of the tough.",
    "I love it.",
    "This is one of my favourites of the recent studies you've done with this.",
    "The really, really nice.",
    "I hope you're happy with it.",
    "Really awesome.",
    "OK, let's see.",
    "And family that's I think you didn't even take the full time so you get a little extra points for that.",
    "Here's my end result.",
    "It was hard but fun.",
    "Beautiful color shift from the cyan blue to the greens.",
    "You got a layer of lighter green and then darker.",
    "Yeah, I really like your foliage and your Moss.",
    "This is a cool texture kind of zoom in over here.",
    "I like that.",
    "Good stuff, Annie.",
    "Yeah, definitely glad you painted with us.",
    "Yeah, I think you're doing good.",
    "Love hide ranges.",
    "Alina I'm a fan too.",
    "I'm going to maybe add some extra ones in here.",
    "Good job guys.",
    "Thank you so much for painting with me is really fun.",
    "I appreciate the company and all you guys hanging out to let me close up my previous reference.",
    "We're going to get started on the new one.",
    "Make sure this is saved alright, so the next one is going to be a bit of a challenge for me.",
    "But that's a good thing.",
    "Here is the image and this is the.",
    "Post from the original photographer, you can find this link below.",
    "The stream in the description and let me get set up here.",
    "Oh yeah, I guess I can stop the previous timer.",
    "OK, who this one is this one is a little intimidating, but isn't it beautiful?",
    "I hope you guys like the image.",
    "I'm going to do the best I can to get an ice or watercolor animated background kind of feel through it.",
    "Let's use pure ref again to hold our smaller image.",
    "We'll have a little thumbnail view here.",
    "Hey, just go to thank you.",
    "Will move this one over.",
    "And we can you canvas.",
    "So this is going to be a like a portrait style.",
    "Um, instead of landscape style, but it's still a landscape, so environment.",
    "Let's see image image size, so the reference images 1700 by 1275 pixels that certainly big enough for a study, but I think I'll make it a little bit bigger.",
    "Maybe maybe it'll turn out good, make little Prince of it or something.",
    "Bisani, Thanks for joining us.",
    "See Friday.",
    "Take care.",
    "Is this the Bob Ross tire of screws streaming?",
    "I'm definitely about.",
    "I've definitely Bob Ross fan.",
    "It flushed a lot of his videos.",
    "Glad you like it.",
    "Went back to give Lee brushes for that one.",
    "Oh that makes me happy Jackson and wait.",
    "I think I'm going to use some of them on this next one myself.",
    "'cause there's so much foliage.",
    "Read, I'm glad you like it.",
    "I was so I was.",
    "I was deciding for awhile on which images to paint.",
    "I really really like this one and I was kind of 2nd guessing it because it's I think it's a difficult one, but I hope.",
    "I hope you guys like it.",
    "But I like love the image, but I'm very much scared of it too OK.",
    "I'm going to try to break it down.",
    "Into something easier.",
    "That's my goal, so let's hope we can do it.",
    "I think you foster thanks everyone.",
    "Alright, let me just save and then will start.",
    "So this is going to be scared away.",
    "Study.",
    "It.",
    "I don't think I painted that many other stairways so.",
    "Hey Wilson.",
    "So I'm going to put a color in the background just to start with because.",
    "I want to get rid of the.",
    "Background, sorry, the white background.",
    "We can go with like an Asian put Gray with like little Gray blue off.",
    "A little off Gray color and I'm going to do a sketch.",
    "There is no way.",
    "Then I'm going to do this without sketching first.",
    "That's two too much architecture stuff happening.",
    "So here we go.",
    "It looks like we have about 2/3.",
    "Of the scene is the stairs an maybe around the top third we have.",
    "Everything else.",
    "So it looks like we have a little area you can walk.",
    "There's like a handrail type thing here and then.",
    "Above that I think we're seeing another like a walkway.",
    "Up above here so.",
    "You can hold shift to make a straight line as your painting so.",
    "If you guys.",
    "Are wondering I'm not like just that.",
    "Good at drawing straight line.",
    "You can hold shift while you're painting.",
    "I'm trying to think about dimensions and things here.",
    "Alright, usually I'll go freehand, but that just seemed seemed a good time tease.",
    "He's a straight line and we have an extreme.",
    "Affect of.",
    "The stairway is coming towards us.",
    "We have that for shortening.",
    "He'd areas what did I miss?",
    "I can give a quick peek at the painting we did before this.",
    "This was the first painting of the day, so we're kind of going for this Ghibli sort of style like traditional watermedia painting.",
    "And we're going to be doing the same thing for this one here.",
    "They cut us right at the beginning.",
    "You can do it no doubt.",
    "Thank you, Simon.",
    "Thank you.",
    "I appreciate it.",
    "OK, um, so there's going to be steps.",
    "I don't think it will.",
    "I don't think I need to go in here and start painting all the individual steps.",
    "what I will do is kind of just sketching a general idea.",
    "I'm not going to count them or go and go crazy.",
    "But I just want to kind of get a handle on the idea that they get as I get closer us they are.",
    "They seem bigger.",
    "You know further back we're getting more for short and look where we basically just see the tops of the stairs and then they get closer and closer us.",
    "We can see more of the step.",
    "So something like that that's actually too much, but you get the idea so.",
    "Just thinking through this.",
    "I'm going to put this layer on a lower opacity so I can barely see it and then make a new layer and I'm going to do another sketch, so I think it would be hard to do this next sketch if the other layer was really dark, so this would be a little bit easier and I want to think I want to breakdown.",
    "This is what I was talking about.",
    "Things seeming overwhelming.",
    "I want to try to group things and break them down and look at what's happening in the picture or try to make it more simple.",
    "So if you look at the one way we can think about it is the value structure.",
    "If you look at the reference in black-and-white, this is what it looks like.",
    "So it becomes a lot more simple.",
    "This becomes all one big blob is all one big shape and then you get this shape here that comes down and across like this and then back here is light and there's nothing very dark or very very contrast it back here.",
    "I think most contrast is right here.",
    "So that's something to keep in mind.",
    "That's one way we could organize this.",
    "And.",
    "Let's see.",
    "Yeah, so I think you know you could do something like this and kind of.",
    "Sketch in this is full teach coming from over there.",
    "We can have some coming from here.",
    "This is the darker shadow coming across.",
    "Kind of coming down a little bit.",
    "And then we've got a big group of leaves coming out here and here, kind of reaching out.",
    "We've got trees up here on the right, and they have branches reaching out into the center and we could add more.",
    "You know you.",
    "Like the idea of seeing the actual tree trunk and branches, you can always add more branches.",
    "Yeah.",
    "So we can look at these architectural elements.",
    "Sketch them in now too, if that makes it easier.",
    "Perfect time to be here.",
    "Second painting, I hope it's going to be a good one.",
    "I'm glad you're here or at the beginning.",
    "So where so?",
    "I'm looking for sort of landmarks because there's a lot of.",
    "Chaotic kind of stuff going on this reference.",
    "So what I'm looking for is the blue roof.",
    "That's an important part.",
    "And then under that we've got a bunch of other details that honestly we can kind of wing it, and I don't think it matters if there's one missing Brown detail we can.",
    "I think we can be fine with that, but the blue roof seems important.",
    "There's some details above that, and then we get to an actual another walkway.",
    "So I think these are the important things to sort of.",
    "Tell the story about this.",
    "Area I think switched to a hard racer.",
    "I'm pro designer says Mattie or anyone know about vanishing point in photo shop?",
    "I don't know off the top of my head.",
    "I know there are perspective tools and photo shop, but I the only ones that I really use our.",
    "For example, if I've already painted something, go to edit transform perspective.",
    "You can kind of warped things and give them a perspective and I use this sometimes amid manipulate my sketches.",
    "Buttom I don't know.",
    "Yeah, I usually do the same as we are.",
    "I usually kind of wing it and just sort things out as I go.",
    "I might have to correct mistakes, but I don't usually use the, you know, use the perspective grids.",
    "It maybe I should but.",
    "I generally enjoy to just take a reference image, an work from that.",
    "And just do my best.",
    "Thank you Michael.",
    "So I will erase out a little bit here.",
    "I want to draw in.",
    "There's a really bright.",
    "Bush, that kind of reaches out in front here.",
    "It's behind the walkway.",
    "But it's pretty bright, and then there's darker.",
    "Bush is in front of that.",
    "So I think we're starting to simplify things.",
    "I don't usually do this in my sketch, but I think it might help to think about this.",
    "Is the whole area.",
    "This is The Shadow area.",
    "It actually comes down further.",
    "There's like a very dark shadow up here.",
    "But a liter.",
    "Less intense shadow.",
    "Comes down all the way to the bottom corner.",
    "But then the most intense part is right here.",
    "And then this isn't a shadow, but it's actually a darker colored plant.",
    "But that helps create this like you shape.",
    "Yeah, and that's.",
    "The main idea, I think.",
    "This little shadow over here alright so.",
    "I think we can do it.",
    "I'm going to erase out some of my previous sketch.",
    "Not layer below.",
    "And then.",
    "Bring that, bring that Opacity back up and we'll merge those two.",
    "So here's my sketch.",
    "We can go edit transform perspective like I was talking about earlier.",
    "You could use the perspective tool to make it look even more like, Oh, it's going up into the distance.",
    "We kind of push that.",
    "We could make it a little bit smaller like this.",
    "Z.",
    "I think a sign how it was, but it was fun to mess around with it, OK?",
    "So let's start painting.",
    "Go put my sketch layer on multiply mode.",
    "And lower the Opacity.",
    "And then lock the layer.",
    "And how are we going to do about this one?",
    "Hum.",
    "Be cause the value structure is like the most important thing in this painting.",
    "I wonder if it would be a good idea to kind of almost do like a colorized black-and-white thing.",
    "We could try something different.",
    "Let's try like that totally different workflow.",
    "So I'm going to grab a soft edged brush.",
    "Japan has one soft edge, one hard edge, and I'm going to paint.",
    "I'm just going to color pic from the background like almost just the Gray color.",
    "Wondering how you will be able to high exposure of the photo.",
    "Yeah, it is really bright.",
    "I don't know yet.",
    "I don't think it's too bad.",
    "The worst area seems to be on that foliage on the left.",
    "I don't know.",
    "We'll see.",
    "We'll see I painted so much foliage on the bright side, I think.",
    "For me personally, I came sometimes make up what's not there.",
    "If the photos overexposed.",
    "Ah, Michael, thank you.",
    "Thank you for posting that answer for pro designer.",
    "Bucket of light and dark?",
    "Yeah, that's what I'm gonna try.",
    "I don't usually work this way, so I think it'll be fun.",
    "So we're basically already doing a value were already kind of working with the value structure.",
    "Version, but I can still be saturated to get rid of that, like blue color.",
    "I'm thinking like this.",
    "So the darkest parts right here.",
    "I'm sorry if you guys can hear screaming children in my neighborhood.",
    "Is that allowed outside?",
    "Right now?",
    "I live next to a school, so.",
    "Talking Valley famous last words.",
    "Let's try totally different workflow.",
    "Why do I do this?",
    "Alright, so this little.",
    "By the way, if you're doing this, I think it makes sense to turn your painting.",
    "You turn your reference image into black and White 2.",
    "Don't feel like I'm just going to turn my painting in the black and white so will do will do this, but don't feel like you have to try to look at the reference image and figure it all out.",
    "You can turn your reference image into black and white and then.",
    "No.",
    "It helps when you're painting black and white.",
    "I thought it was let's just wing it.",
    "Both of those I'm feeling both of those right now.",
    "But a flat brush is really nice for doing stairs and stuff like this.",
    "Hey Pablo's So what I learned from working in black and white to color is you don't want to go too far with your version in black and white.",
    "Best to start polarizing it early and then.",
    "Then keep painting.",
    "I notice if I go too far and then add color it ends up always looking colorized, but I just want to use this as a starting point.",
    "Hey Chris, you know I always Dream Wednesdays on be hands.",
    "I was very excited when they invited me to stream here and it's been awhile now.",
    "I've been streaming here about.",
    "It's almost coming on a year.",
    "Yeah, but this is my once a week Wednesday Wednesday stream on PC.",
    "Alright, so now let's see my own but yeah, OK.",
    "I'm going to make a new layer and I'm going to try colourising this now and then will continue the rest of the painting in color.",
    "Hopefully that will help our planning of the where the lights and darks are going to be.",
    "Hi Lauren, welcome.",
    "We can either use the same brush or maybe grab an airbrush or something.",
    "I'll think I'll even airbrush and I'm going to put my layer blending mode an overlay.",
    "One thing that I noticed about one thing that I noticed about colourising things that sometimes it's a little bit easier to go from a like a sepia and colorize it versus a completely black and white so we can go to image, adjust Hue, saturation, an colorized.",
    "The image we have now.",
    "As a starting point.",
    "Just find something that feels right.",
    "Get seem to do black and white with the color without it looking Mighty.",
    "Yep, I know the feeling that's usually the case for me, so I'm not sure how this is going to go.",
    "I feel the same clarity.",
    "I often get muddy colors when I do this, so I'm going to try to try to work it out.",
    "Um, let's see.",
    "Can anybody stream on be hands?",
    "There is a place that you can request an invite 'cause it's currently in Abeita.",
    "So see.",
    "I think I'm I'm looking for the link for you.",
    "I hope this is still the right link, but I'm going to post the link in chat where I think you can.",
    "Let's see.",
    "If you'd like to be in place really access sign up here.",
    "Yeah, OK, I have a link for you where I think you can request.",
    "Send an invite.",
    "Yeah, that's a really good recommendation.",
    "Yarra Yarra is talking about.",
    "An artist, Dave Greco.",
    "He regularly uses a black and white to color workflow and he's really good at it and his stuff never looks muddy.",
    "It's crazy.",
    "Yeah, he's really good at it.",
    "OK, so let's go to the next layer.",
    "I put it on overlay already and I'm going to try adding color.",
    "Let's see how it goes.",
    "Whoops, OK, there we go.",
    "So I have a an airbrush, but actually let's go for that brush I was using before.",
    "And we'll just start painting in.",
    "Colors.",
    "Primary shadows and lights said there so well on the sketch.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Hi Eduardo, are you doing good?",
    "I'm glad I'm having a good day.",
    "So at some green here, what color is it on the?",
    "On the pavement.",
    "Is it green?",
    "I think there's a cool color coming from the left, but it's only on the highlights.",
    "I might save that for like a final like an extra something.",
    "We spend extra time on.",
    "Right now I'm trying to block in so we get a nice warm color here.",
    "Maybe we can go a little bit more cool in the shadows.",
    "So I'm looking for blue.",
    "I'm putting putting like blue greens in the shadows and more yellow greens.",
    "In the highlight areas.",
    "And then in the background, we've got some interesting things going on.",
    "Back here and we don't have to paint everything in exactly like it is in the reference.",
    "If we find a way to make something maybe clearer, we can do that.",
    "I really like this bright warm light at the top of the stairs.",
    "Leart says it's all in the value of the color and contrast to the grey being painted on salt.",
    "Yeah, because you don't want when your colourising something.",
    "Ideally you don't want to change the values too much and you can see that I am changing them.",
    "It is changing.",
    "But we try to keep it as close as possible to the original value sketch as possible.",
    "One thing that I noticed is back when I used to really, really 'cause a few times I tried doing black and white to color workflow most of the time I just I.",
    "I don't use this workflow but when I first tried it a big struggle that I had was.",
    "I would paint.",
    "I would get the values looking.",
    "I thought pretty good and then by the time I would colorize it I would have really changed them.",
    "Alright, so I do like this so far.",
    "I think I'll merge it down or maybe save the background version if we want to do a little processing later.",
    "I'm looking at my sketch and I kind of cutoff.",
    "Originally a little detail on the top that I think I'd like to add in a little architectural detail.",
    "So.",
    "Let me squish this down a little bit.",
    "And add the extra.",
    "And extra bit.",
    "So now we're getting into real.",
    "The real painting, so we're not like colourising anything, we're just painting, so I'm going to start bringing in some colors like this blue roof.",
    "Like a teal teal ish color.",
    "There is this, does it preserve the values when using the color mode instead of overlay?",
    "Or does it change them slightly to color mode usually doesn't change them.",
    "It usually doesn't serve in a couple times where it has something weird happen, but it was like only very, very slight.",
    "Color mode is usually in a case choice, I just.",
    "I don't know.",
    "I kind of prefer overlays sometimes.",
    "It depends on if I'm comfortable with it having a slight change and if I want to maybe add a little bit of lighting effects or something.",
    "Yeah, overlay is a little bit more likely to change the values, So what you are talking about if you guys if anyone doesn't know, you can make a new layer, put it on color mode instead of.",
    "Overlay and then if I go here and whatever color I paint, it doesn't.",
    "It doesn't.",
    "Change the value, it just changes the color.",
    "We are says, I think oil painters use a value sketch most before adding color.",
    "Yeah, that's kind of what got me interested in it.",
    "It seems like these kind of under paintings done by people looks very handy.",
    "All right, so we're on a normal layer.",
    "And.",
    "Trying to go through and add the details.",
    "In the background.",
    "Some holding shift to get straight lines again.",
    "And the background I want to keep it pretty light.",
    "That's a lot bigger.",
    "Oh, I see what it is.",
    "This should come up here.",
    "And then there's another Bush.",
    "Some like the one the other side I just noticed.",
    "Alright, so here's our steps so far.",
    "First one and then change some proportions.",
    "And call it a couple more stairs here.",
    "So I feel like we might be able to actually get rid of this sketch already.",
    "It seems like very seems faster than I was expecting, which is nice.",
    "I kind of like to get rid of the sketch and just paint whenever possible, and I'll keep the sketch on its own layer with the visibility turned off, just in case we want to come back to that, but I think I can see enough of what's happening to leave it off for now.",
    "So looking at the reference and looking at my painting, I'm just trying to notice.",
    "What are the biggest areas that are there are differing from each other?",
    "Because I kind of want to prioritize my work from.",
    "And not get into any little detail areas when other areas are like really off.",
    "Thank you Darius.",
    "Jackson says overly will change the value.",
    "Color mode will not that's I find overlay multiply better in most occasions, but it depends a lot on the way you start the paint.",
    "In black and white, that's true, that's true.",
    "Do you often use textures as the final touches for making the paintings more natural?",
    "Yeah, I usually.",
    "I usually do textures as sort of an ending thing.",
    "There are exceptions to that.",
    "Sometimes I use.",
    "I use textured brushes throughout the painting, but generally when I do that I'm using brushes that are kind of trying to emulate.",
    "Traditional paint strokes and things like that, but I do feel like textures kind of like the icing on the cake and it's most important to think about the values like where the lights and darks are in the image and the you know the colors, the overall composition that shapes all of that stuff is more important than the textures in my opinion, like textures are kind of the last thing, it doesn't mean you can't paint them as you go, but it's just.",
    "The other things are more important in carrying a painting to be successful.",
    "And textures are sort of a icing on the cake type thing.",
    "Bottom right corner, there should be some plans.",
    "I don't know if I'm going to add those in to be honest.",
    "We might take some artistic license.",
    "So The thing is.",
    "There's some interesting effects in this scene because of the.",
    "The way that it was photographed, there were some plants that were like really close to the photographer that got blurred out and it looks really pretty in the photo, but in my painting I don't think I will include the blurry leaves, but we can still include some here that are, you know, nearer to the ground.",
    "I think those are fine, but I don't know about the ones like floating.",
    "I think it's one of those things that looks better in the photo then it might in the painting, but you guys are welcome to include it in yours.",
    "If you guys are doing this study with me.",
    "Whoops, so we zoomed in.",
    "If you decide it would look good.",
    "So let's see about the tree.",
    "Trunk and branches.",
    "I am doing this on a separate layer.",
    "So I think it will be handy to be able to pay under this.",
    "Process How do I start digital painting?",
    "Wait what do you mean like you like?",
    "How do you start?",
    "Painting your first time ever.",
    "I haven't tutorial I can recommend to you because it's a lot to kind of go through and explain right now.",
    "I mean.",
    "I've sort of been talking through this painting, which we start a few minutes ago, but if you are just getting into painting, it might be a bit fast.",
    "What I'm doing so I would suggest watching it tutorial that's on YouTube or something like that that you can go slowly through and you can pause it and replay areas that that will help you, because that's the thing that I notice when I first started digitally.",
    "Painting is with a bit difficult, and when I would watch tutorials it would be.",
    "A lot of them would be moving a bit fast for me, so anyway, let me get I gotta link for you here.",
    "I'm going to post it in the chat.",
    "This is my.",
    "Resources page and that has links to a lot of different.",
    "A lot of different Oh my gosh, thank you Jackson.",
    "There's a lot of tutorials there and then here's one specifically that I want to recommend.",
    "One pixel brush website.",
    "I've loved these tutorials.",
    "They really helped me out.",
    "Everyone's different learning styles, but the one pixel brush tutorials you gotta go to this website and scroll all the way down.",
    "Scroll all the way down to the bottom.",
    "This video here starts with actually installing photo shop.",
    "That's how it starts at the very very beginning.",
    "If you already have it installed, you could probably start on number one.",
    "It also comes with a brush set you want to download.",
    "The very first brush that on the page.",
    "This shad brush that is an awesome set.",
    "And then start with number one and just go up through.",
    "I've watched these multiple times.",
    "I paused and replayed them until I understood and it really helped me.",
    "So that's my number one suggestion.",
    "And you're welcome to ask me any further questions as I'm working and I'm happy to show, but there's a lot of trial and error.",
    "You gotta try things out and experiment and just know that that's normal.",
    "Just like in learning anything.",
    "So trying to be trying to be discouraged.",
    "Uhm, yeah, and you're welcome to watch any of the streams that I do or other artists.",
    "You can replay the stream later and that way you can also pause and skip around.",
    "And things like that too.",
    "All right?",
    "So the tree here.",
    "I might do I might make it my tree a little bit different 'cause this my artistic license.",
    "I think I like like having a.",
    "A little bit more of a bold.",
    "Sheep.",
    "But Yeah.",
    "There we go.",
    "And then we're going to little branches coming out here.",
    "I'm trying not to create the same shape over and over again, 'cause I have a real tendency to do that.",
    "Tony says if you were standing at the spot that I would not see blurred foliage and in the painting it could be sharpened to create a bit of overhang.",
    "Yeah yeah, if I was going to add foliage to the painting it would be with I would make them.",
    "Just a regular looking plants.",
    "Not blurred out.",
    "That's an idea.",
    "That's an idea.",
    "I'm going to focus on the sort of the rest of the painting 'cause I feel like that's something we could sort of ad in later if we fail, it's needed.",
    "And Stephanie option.",
    "So I'm going to add a bunch of Little Twigs and branches.",
    "Just to make it look lively over here in a bit busy.",
    "And help explain where all these leaves are coming from.",
    "So.",
    "Maybe we'll hear shift that a little bit more.",
    "Alright, I think I like it, so the reason I did this on a separate layer was because I thought I might want to.",
    "Add brighter greens behind there.",
    "As you can see, there's a lot of layering.",
    "If we add lighter greens behind here we get stronger silhouette.",
    "Of the tree, and I mean, if you look at the reference, there is a bit of a strong silhouette, at least up here, not everywhere.",
    "So if you think about how much We want to commit to that.",
    "But I do think it's kind of nice to get that real glowy feeling from the light.",
    "So we have to have be brave with the contrast.",
    "So right now I'm just making my brush smaller and making little dots to indicate leaves in groups of leaves or not getting too fancy with that.",
    "Yet we might.",
    "We might add some.",
    "I have some leaf brushes and foliage brushes that I made.",
    "I kind of feel you're a cat person really.",
    "I am a cat person.",
    "I don't have any cats.",
    "I'm actually a bit allergic to them, even though I do like them.",
    "I have had cats in the past, so just kind of had to suffer through the allergies part.",
    "But yeah, I do like cats.",
    "I like I like dogs too though.",
    "I'm drawing a vector image of the Tiger that sounds cool.",
    "I hope it's going well.",
    "How much you given in a day and starting digital painting for practice?",
    "Uhm, I think yeah, that's tough ones answer.",
    "I would say do what you can.",
    "I think it's good to practice, you know at least.",
    "1/2 an hour if you want to really improve quickly and a half an hour to an hour would be sort of a minimum, but you don't need to do that every single day.",
    "You know you don't want to burn out.",
    "You gotta find a way for it to fit into your life, your lifestyle and everything like that, and especially if it's if it's sort of a hobby or like a new thing that you're starting to do.",
    "That's not necessarily your work, and your you know, gotta pace yourself.",
    "For me, I was a traditional artist 1st and then I started adjusting into digital, but I sort of went.",
    "I was a full time artist.",
    "Then I was shifting mediums so for me when I started with digital I was doing digital like 8 hours a day minimum because I was just switching from traditional work to digital work.",
    "But I still had a work day.",
    "That I had to get through and do you know?",
    "So I was getting a lot of practice like kind of went right into it.",
    "But I know not everyone is in that position, and if you're doing, if you have other work you're doing, then you have to just do what you can do and don't burnout.",
    "That's important too.",
    "I've broken three pencils today.",
    "Uh, No.",
    "That stuff.",
    "All right, so we're going back.",
    "I like saving these layers.",
    "It's kind of fun to look back and also sometimes it's handy if you want to go back and change something.",
    "Think I'll merge down those trees and I'm happy with it.",
    "Oh, I forgot to put on my timer before this painting how silly I mean.",
    "Alright I will put on a 2 hour timer now 'cause that's kind of like the maximum amount of time I have left that I can stream today.",
    "I don't know if this painting will take the whole 2 hours or not, but I'll put on a timer now.",
    "I forgot about that.",
    "You guys, 'cause I don't usually have a timer during when I stream here and be hands, but this is a new thing brush.",
    "I'm using a brush that I.",
    "Made it like a modified brush of about modified version of a free brush that I downloaded you can download.",
    "A ver very very close to this.",
    "If you look below my stream in the description, there is a brushes.",
    "There's a link to my brushes.",
    "There's one in there called soft shading and blending and it's very very similar to this one I just tweaked.",
    "Uh, some things I've changed a couple things.",
    "This brush is inspired by that one I've recently made it so it's not like available anywhere that I can share it with you, but there's a very, very similar brush that I love that I use often since that you can download.",
    "But it looks like this.",
    "This is the got one hard edge and one softer edge and it is.",
    "It uses.",
    "Pressure sensitivity of my tablet.",
    "To make the.",
    "Picture later, darker.",
    "So adding some more details, shadows and highlights and mostly shadows, this area was already pretty bright, so adding a little bit of shadows in over here.",
    "Got blue green leaves on the left.",
    "Let's flip.",
    "Hi Nicholas, I am using a centriq so I have a PC and it's attached.",
    "I have are welcome centriq 22.",
    "I've never tried the surface but it looks cool.",
    "Like this workflow and your quick pace on it, thanks clever.",
    "This is going well so far.",
    "I don't know if I'm going to hit a block at some point, but.",
    "So far OK.",
    "You need to plug into reminder timer.",
    "Excuse me, I need to plug into remind me to use the plug.",
    "Hopeless.",
    "That's funny.",
    "Alright, so I want to add some more shadows over here.",
    "Applied He's unsplash, yes.",
    "I love unsplash.",
    "I use Pexels Unsplash, Pixabay.",
    "All these kind of websites to find good reference images for my artwork, San for studies and things like that.",
    "Very, very thankful that.",
    "Some photographers are so kind to share their work for free because I've been trying to avoid just going to Google and using things groups.",
    "Oh my gosh, really turned that shortcut.",
    "Because, uh.",
    "Yeah, you can't necessarily just use any image that's out there on the Internet.",
    "It's good to be safe, and there's just so many good images on those websites that there's no reason to mess around with Copyright and things.",
    "You might as well just go ahead and use something you know is safe to use on your loud and I picked.",
    "You have the surface.",
    "What do you think about a JS?",
    "Do you like it?",
    "Living this really attractive to me about it is that it's portable, right?",
    "It's a laptop, but you can also use it as a drawing tablet.",
    "And you can take it with you.",
    "I would love to have my full sentence like this be able to just move around.",
    "And I know there's the iPad and everything, but it's just not the same to me.",
    "I want the full.",
    "Photo shop.",
    "But yeah, when I work at home, I'm honest and T.",
    "And.",
    "And I'm very happy with this setup.",
    "If anybody's interested in tablets and getting a tablet and getting into digital art and all that, I just want to stress that you don't have to jump in and get a 70 or something.",
    "I love my tablet, but.",
    "It's not necessarily a starter tablet.",
    "I mean if it happens to be in your budget, that's great, but there's a lot less expensive tablets that are good for digital art, and I'll post a link in the chat that has some reviews.",
    "It's a good tablet review site.",
    "Oh, you're welcome pro no problem.",
    "Yeah, that's a tablet review site I just posted link in chat and just got a lot of good info for screen tablets and pen tablets.",
    "So not all tablets have a screen.",
    "I personally do think the screen tablets are maybe a little bit of an easier transition for someone who is used to drawing on paper.",
    "At least that was true for me, but they are generally more expensive.",
    "There's a little bit more of a learning curve getting used to non screen tablets but.",
    "People tell me that once you use it for awhile that you do get get used to that.",
    "Going to start getting into photography in December.",
    "Can't wait to share my work on unsplash.",
    "Hey, that's awesome.",
    "What kind of photography do you do like?",
    "Do you like to take portraits or landscapes or just anything that catches your eye?",
    "Maybe I'll paint one of your pictures.",
    "Someday.",
    "This one area is catching my eye in the freaking of in the reference.",
    "It's a high contrast area.",
    "It's really pretty and I want to get this area right.",
    "So one thing that I'm trying to keep in mind as I work is not getting too detailed on anything at this stage.",
    "So even though I was kind of focusing in on that one area, I'm still zoomed out all the way.",
    "So if you find that you get 2 sucked into details, zoom out, stay zoomed out, paint from this distance.",
    "And only zoom in when everything looks good at this distance when everything looks good at this distance, then you know you can go to the next.",
    "Step and zoom in and clean things up a bit.",
    "So I'm turning my later on and off of what I did to see.",
    "Like is it helping sometimes.",
    "I paint for awhile.",
    "And then I turn the later on and off.",
    "I look at the previous version and I think oops.",
    "Kind of went in the wrong direction with that like I went, I messed something up and then I'll go back.",
    "Well that's cool math, yeah, thank you for the recommendation.",
    "I can look into it.",
    "Part of my problem is I'm so part of The thing is I love my having my keyboard shortcuts and everything and when I am on the iPad I just feel I'm a lot slower so.",
    "I'm usually not going to use it when I'm at home, but I will.",
    "May be able to use it when I'm out and about and looking for an alternative.",
    "Clearly says I used to be really big into landscape photography.",
    "My DSL our was attached to my hand always been meaning to get into it for some time.",
    "Again, I think it's a great idea.",
    "I mean, I know right now is kind of a weird time, but if you have.",
    "Yeah, an opportunity I think.",
    "It really helps in painting.",
    "I think photography is really good for getting practice coming up with compositions.",
    "And like all the things that you have to pay attention to and photography like align with things you have to pay attention to in painting and then of course you get your own reference photos which is also nice.",
    "Like to take photos of nature so mostly animals and Flowers nice.",
    "And like it.",
    "Once you get used to a software with the settings and hotkeys, it can take a lot to make you change it.",
    "Really it's so true.",
    "Are you saying welcome now?",
    "Yes, I have the centriq 22.",
    "I have the.",
    "It's like the regular version, not the pro version.",
    "But yeah, I love it.",
    "I'm very happy with this.",
    "So there's some dappled light on the stairs here.",
    "In the centre we will be adding that in the distance, there's some darker blue green stuff happening here.",
    "Do you know any shortcut for rotating the brush?",
    "Yeah, we usually.",
    "I have this open an I just go to the brush tip shape and turn it like this.",
    "What you're talking about.",
    "I wish it was the thing guven I I will go here and turn the brush.",
    "So here's here's the options you have.",
    "And you might already know about this.",
    "Some of this, so just forgive me, but this brush here has shaped dynamics.",
    "Angle jitter is an direction, so this will allow depending on.",
    "Which way you're going with the direction of your brush, it's going to.",
    "You can have it go in different directions, but.",
    "If you want to, the only other thing you can do is sometimes I want to be able to paint with it.",
    "Just being in One Direction like let me try to show your Tom Cruise playing but I can be sure you understand this brush here.",
    "I will come over here and just turn it sometimes and just do it.",
    "Just do it like this.",
    "Because I want the calligraphy kind of aspect to it.",
    "If I take this brush and put it on direction.",
    "If I put angle jitter on direction.",
    "You get this.",
    "It's going in the direction I want, but it doesn't have this sort of calligraphy effect anymore, it's like.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Is there are ways to get to to do work with it?",
    "But it doesn't work as easily as if you had a real paintbrush.",
    "There is if you're using welcome, you do have something called the art pen that allows more of that.",
    "Let's see.",
    "Yeah, there's something called the art pen and that is allows you to do that a little bit more.",
    "The only downside to that is.",
    "I think it doesn't work perfectly.",
    "I have are paman.",
    "I don't use it.",
    "Sadly some people love it.",
    "I know some artists that use it and seem to really like it, but I don't know for me.",
    "It's just a little bit laggy so I prefer to just turn the brush tip myself if I want to.",
    "I wanted to be in a different direction.",
    "Ah, thank you.",
    "Pablo's was very kind of you.",
    "There's also a link below the stream description to the to the Ghibli brushes.",
    "The Ghibli inspired brushes that I made.",
    "I might use some of us, some of them in this painting.",
    "'cause it seems the right aesthetic here.",
    "Jackson says if you have Photoshop CC 20 or even 19.",
    "Not sure you can use the arrow keys to change the angle shift plus arrow's to change in steps.",
    "Oh, I think this talk about this.",
    "I feel like you probably already told me about this Jackson.",
    "Yeah, exactly, are that's definitely something that I miss.",
    "I've kind of come to terms with it, but the technology is improving all the time, so I'm hoping that you know in the next years things will be closer like that.",
    "22 mimicking traditional.",
    "I mean you look at what's going on with some of the textures and fresco, the watercolor textures and things like that.",
    "There's a lot of stuff that's really pushing to get more traditional.",
    "So I think it will happen.",
    "Alright, I'm gonna choose a.",
    "Airbrush for my racer.",
    "So I can make these hard edged brush strokes for the stairway.",
    "Like this and then erase out a little bit on the side for a more subtle fade into the light.",
    "I'm not being too concerned with making the stairs exactly as they are.",
    "Luckily, these stairs are very.",
    "Um organic like there, they they've been a little bit maybe disrupted by tree roots and things.",
    "They're kind of bumpy and.",
    "Yeah, they're very cozy.",
    "It's like little cobblestone.",
    "Kind of feeling.",
    "Yep, that's true.",
    "We are.",
    "It's really true.",
    "Before I merge this down, I'm going to make a selection of the.",
    "The colour here I think I want to add a little bit more of like a warm glow.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Just a little bit.",
    "Emerge that down.",
    "Actually no, it one more thing.",
    "So we're getting there.",
    "We're getting more precise with things.",
    "Oh, I started talking about this earlier and then I think I got distracted in the background.",
    "There's some more distant foliage and things that are a little bit darker.",
    "and I do think we should paint it in that way because it allows the bright green leaves in front of it to really stand out.",
    "Nonuniform yeah wonky stairs.",
    "It's too hard advantage this time but the stairs are not.",
    "Perfect 'cause we don't have to worry all that much.",
    "We've got light coming through back here and all kinds of random little.",
    "Little different here shifts and things just.",
    "And distant foliage that kind of is abstract back there.",
    "Now we want to keep it.",
    "We don't want it to be dark.",
    "Look if I color pic from it.",
    "This is the value.",
    "It's still light compared to over here.",
    "For example, we want to keep it still light enough that it feels like as this airy distant glowy feeling, but we want it to be dark enough that the highlight this branch can come out in front of it and look Lite.",
    "So This is why we should pay attention to the darks and lights and relationships.",
    "Even if it's a little extra concentration when we work.",
    "The Beverly Bright highly up here.",
    "But the last couple steps are very glowy, and it's really pretty satisfying.",
    "So what to do next?",
    "I think one of the more confusing areas of the scene is up here.",
    "There's no telling what's going on.",
    "It looks like there's an archway.",
    "There's there's just too many overlapping elements.",
    "So I'm going to do my best to recreate what there, but it's hard when you can't really tell what's going on.",
    "In the past I used to really get fixated on that.",
    "I would really get stuck trying to figure out what was actually going on in the scene, and The thing is, it really doesn't need to be.",
    "Perfect, it just needs to feel right.",
    "We can.",
    "We don't really need to understand what we're painting exactly.",
    "We just need to paint it in roughly the right colors and shapes in the right places like we can, for example.",
    "We have this post coming down here and then to the right of that.",
    "You see the what look like some kind of archway.",
    "And we just kind of put.",
    "Maybe there's some darker.",
    "Details here you can just start painting stuff in remotely where it is in the reference.",
    "You don't have to like say, OK, that's a side table with a plant on top and this is not just paint.",
    "Some of the colors in that you see.",
    "How do you manage the layers you name them of stairs or trees?",
    "Actually, I'm painting in a very different way.",
    "I don't like to keep things on separate layers.",
    "My if you see my layers here over on the right.",
    "I'm actually only saving layers to be able to make like a little step by step sheet kind of thing later, but I'm basically kind of painting on one layer.",
    "This is just saving at time lapse kind of thing, but the only active layers right now are these three really?",
    "This is my whole painting and then these are layers that I'm working on.",
    "what I usually do is paint for awhile and then merge down.",
    "Like if I like what I did so I'll just paint for awhile and then sort of turn the layer on a Nov.",
    "See how it's going and if I like it I merge it down.",
    "That's mostly because I'm trying to make a work on a style that looks more like a traditional painting, and I'm not necessarily doing this as work for a client or something where they might want me to change stuff is just a painting for me and to show you guys my process.",
    "So I yeah, I kind of merge as I go, and I almost always do this.",
    "To answer your question Nicholas, I almost always merges.",
    "I go.",
    "The only example would be The only exception would be again, if I'm like doing a client project and there's something that I think they might want change, then maybe I'll keep that layer separate or.",
    "Sometimes they'll be an exception where they'll be an image that has something right in front of another thing, like the character in front of the background, and it just makes a lot of sense to keep them separate, but most of the time I feel like things look more cohesive if I end up merging and painting on top of all of the layers.",
    "Before it scrolls up too far, I'm just going to take a peek at what Pavlos shared in chat, so let's see.",
    "Oh cool, the Tiger.",
    "You said which one do we like better?",
    "Let me open the other one too.",
    "Arichat, what do you think these are from Pablo's in the chat?",
    "We've got number one.",
    "And #2.",
    "Ooh, that's a tough question.",
    "I like both of them.",
    "I think.",
    "So I like the color combination of this one.",
    "But I feel like this color here gets a little bit like this.",
    "The blueish like this color gets a little bit lost on this side.",
    "And in this one we get the full details of all that, so that stuff.",
    "But I do like this one.",
    "Yeah, that's a tough one.",
    "It's Nicholas if you end up getting cooler is there's a discount code below my stream in the in the description.",
    "But yeah, I don't always have separate.",
    "Have have merged layers.",
    "Sometimes they have separate an example of when I would keep them separate would be if I had.",
    "If I make we were talking about earlier, the option of maybe having leaves come in from the side here and be like in front of everything.",
    "So like, let's say there's a plant really close to us and there's like leaves coming in.",
    "I'm just going to like do something like this.",
    "Let's say there's like some leaves coming in.",
    "I would probably like keep this on a separate layer for awhile.",
    "That way if I want to.",
    "Move it around.",
    "I could, and it's something that's like in front of everything else.",
    "But For the most part, I kind of merge them.",
    "OK.",
    "So I will work up here a little bit more above the blue roof.",
    "There's another like sort of walkway type area.",
    "And I'm just going to kind of go inspired by the reference.",
    "I'm not trying to make every.",
    "Thing exactly the same as the in the reference, 'cause I think we just won't have time to do it.",
    "It's a little bit sad because there's some really cool elements of this architecture that I've been kind of missing out on by not.",
    "Painting everything, but I think it would be a bit tedious to try to do that.",
    "Yeah, I think you did good popular.",
    "Well I think I told you my opinion.",
    "I don't know if the stream is delayed, but I hope you're able to hear it be I think.",
    "I think maybe the first one if I had to pick.",
    "Um, what's the DPI?",
    "Well, I'm working at 72 DPI right now because this image was not planned for a print.",
    "Just plan for a.",
    "Like a digital study, so probably the most thing that I'm going to do with this is posted somewhere, so it's 2250 by 3000 pixels at 72 DPI.",
    "It's still enough pixels that if I really love the result and I wanted to like, make a small print of it, I could, but it's not.",
    "It's not very large image.",
    "If I was going to if I wanted to print this then from the beginning I would think about what size I would probably want it to be printed at and make the image that size 'cause you can do it that way.",
    "He can go file knew.",
    "And then you can type in.",
    "You know I could change this to inches or centimeters and then say, Oh, I want to print it at 18 by 20 inches you know will put our resolution.",
    "That's 300 for print and then I can put 18 inches 20 inches.",
    "And then say create and then I've got my canvas icongo image image size.",
    "So the actual pixel size of what I created is 5400 by 6000 pixels.",
    "But the one I'm working on now is a bit smaller.",
    "But I do think about that generally at the beginning there have been a few times where I was.",
    "Where I should have gone larger and I was like, oh, it's just a quick sketch and I end up liking it.",
    "Kind of wishing it was bigger but.",
    "You It's a bit easier on your.",
    "Computer if you don't work on gigantic files and let's you need to for something, but like it's just everything goes faster.",
    "So I don't make the image is very very big and less I am going to print them otherwise.",
    "Find be a little smaller.",
    "Yep, that's wrong.",
    "I mean, I was reading what you said it's not wrong provider.",
    "That's right, 72 is for web use and.",
    "You're not wrong.",
    "300 Dpi's for print in general.",
    "So I'm really looking forward to painting the foliage, but I'm kind of trying to take care of this.",
    "Um architecture early on.",
    "So that we can have fun and paint the plants.",
    "After this.",
    "Alcohol markers are not super handy to make environments like this.",
    "Let's see what bread is up to.",
    "Cute.",
    "This is really nice, though the colors are nice and saturated.",
    "It almost looks like see it's interesting about alcohol markers is I would think.",
    "At first glance it has a very watercolor type field.",
    "You can tell that there's marker strokes over here, but on this side it looks very watercolor.",
    "I like that vibrant green.",
    "Hey, thanks for drawing with the thread.",
    "Is pretty sweet.",
    "So I'm going to take this.",
    "Hard edge brush.",
    "see I think this one will be good.",
    "And I want to add some highlights on to these.",
    "Stairs.",
    "And I'm going to do it all in a separate layer.",
    "And you know what?",
    "I'm not going to worry about color too much.",
    "I'm selecting the color that I want to use for the really bright glowy stones.",
    "But we also there's also ones in the shadow area that are going to be.",
    "Have more of like a blueish bounce light, Gray greenish bounce light.",
    "And so, but I might, just for ease of painting, I might just kind of stick with this one color and do everything and then apply a gradient to the whole the whole sheep.",
    "I think that might be easy.",
    "Easiest way to do this?",
    "So my favorite thing.",
    "One of my favorite things about this original image that really attracted me too.",
    "It is the light bouncing off of the top of the stones on these steps.",
    "And so that's, yeah, that's what I'm working on right now.",
    "I'm going to take a little bit of time on this.",
    "Make it.",
    "Look nice like in my reference, but you can see right now the color I'm using here is a bit too bright, but it's easy for me to see.",
    "So what we can do is lock the layer like this and grab an airbrush and she's a different color.",
    "And go ahead and add the.",
    "The color like that.",
    "Alright, so let's keep going.",
    "Hopefully this will be.",
    "I'll be able to see this, otherwise I'll just switch to a brighter colour.",
    "Maybe will do that just easier for me to see what shape by making when it's bright and we can always tone it down to something a little more natural.",
    "I have to make sure to make them like wobbly enough.",
    "For some of the stones, we kinda see the edges.",
    "For some we just see the top.",
    "Some of them have unique shapes.",
    "And then when we get far enough down, we're actually going to have some.",
    "Pretty bright, dappled light, shine and abuse, and that's going to be fun.",
    "I think it's one of my favorite parts.",
    "This painting, or.",
    "Photo.",
    "Alright, let's switch to the brighter color here.",
    "I did zoom in a little bit to do this.",
    "As you can see I tried to try not to zoom in too much.",
    "So added a little bit more layers of stairs.",
    "I realized that I was a bit.",
    "Conservative with that, at first I think they get more feeling of distance.",
    "Add a little more layers up here.",
    "Alright, I think I want to move down to the bottom and then kind of meet up halfway, so let's try.",
    "Nice thick brush stroke.",
    "This part is a bit overexposed, but I love the glow Enis.",
    "Thanks Pablo's, a little bit of rim light.",
    "Definitely spruces things up.",
    "And I'm trying to vary a little bit on the thin and thickness of the steps, because they indefinitely you see that change.",
    "The height.",
    "You see some smaller.",
    "Little broken up once.",
    "How much difference when brush stroke and make right?",
    "I love scenes with a heavy light and rim Lake as it is easy to get a lot of satisfying moments like this.",
    "So there's a group of stairs that are kind of close together.",
    "Here it looks like things were kind of crumbling.",
    "Little bit.",
    "Or like dripping down I don't know.",
    "We move this to see what we're doing on time, alright?",
    "You've got a good amount of time left.",
    "I'm going to little later with the.",
    "Luke bedroom lighting.",
    "As we go over to the right that areas in shadow, we also change the color but.",
    "Easier for me to visualize it if I don't go through strong over there.",
    "I could have flipped the canvas when flipped it in awhile.",
    "Want to see things from this side?",
    "We're almost there.",
    "OK, so I'm going to lock the layer we're going to do the gradient, grab the Airbrush so I press the little checkerboard icon.",
    "We can paint any color we want in the side of the shape, so I like the color down that we have by the highlights down here.",
    "But going over to the left in the shadows, I want more of like a Gray, green, blue kind of desaturated color.",
    "So we're going to everything in the shadows were going to tone it down.",
    "The steps look a bit dangerous.",
    "Ha ha ha yeah.",
    "I wonder, I wonder in a in person if it's been treacherous climb up there.",
    "Oh, thank you so much.",
    "Thank you.",
    "I'm going to take a quick peek in black and white.",
    "So what I'm noticing is in the shadows my steps are not quite high, contrast enough.",
    "I think I need to still add a little bit more shading, so I'm glad I didn't merge this down yet.",
    "I'm going to make a new layer.",
    "Let's try overlay mode and below the.",
    "Below the little highlight layer.",
    "We're going to add some darker shading, and I'm going to go with like a greenish blue because I feel like there's a lot of light from the foliage that could be affecting and causing that a little bit of a glow.",
    "Green glow.",
    "And that color actually comes down farther, but I prefer the to go with a warm color down here because I think I feel like that just makes the sunshine look more bright.",
    "So yeah, I will keep it lay down here.",
    "Alright, will merge that down and then this one.",
    "Are we happy with it?",
    "I'm going to lock the layer.",
    "And let's see if we need to bring up the room light.",
    "Again, we're just a little low on contrast.",
    "I wanted to be careful, but maybe I think.",
    "Right, I think I like that.",
    "That's right, we are definitely wanted us to have a challenge.",
    "OK.",
    "Moving on up guys, we're getting there.",
    "OK, let's go back to the soft pressure.",
    "Using earlier.",
    "Do a little bit more work.",
    "I want to look at the.",
    "Oops.",
    "Hold on.",
    "On the sides of the stairs.",
    "Maybe I should continue with the same harder edged brush?",
    "We've got.",
    "These little Stones here.",
    "And they also have.",
    "Have some detail to them.",
    "So we can go with just.",
    "Make a color pic from the highlight and so it's a little bit less bright.",
    "But we do have a little bit of that highlight coming out the side here.",
    "Alright, that feels better.",
    "I have a brush that is actually made for this kind of architecture and it just has a square repeating like this.",
    "And that's it.",
    "Might give me brush.",
    "Pack is a lot of this.",
    "Kind of detail.",
    "In these environments.",
    "So we can just do that one real quick.",
    "And same thing up here.",
    "So I think we can make this a little further.",
    "Alright, little detail goes along way.",
    "Wonder if this is what detail with dark looking that up a bit.",
    "I don't want it to be so high contrast that it's attracting my attention because it's not like the nicest part of the scene.",
    "Appear.",
    "Hey project, how are you?",
    "Yes, the sound is the clicks from the pen and also the my keyboard shortcuts.",
    "I use my left hand on the keyboard to.",
    "Do different things like make my brush bigger and smaller and.",
    "Change the size of zoom in and now and also color.",
    "Pick things like that.",
    "So I have some foliage, brushes and things I might start up with that now because for the sake of finishing this, I think it would be really tough to finish this to paint all the details.",
    "Without some kind of help other than spending a lot longer on it, which I would love to do.",
    "But if I want to finish it during the stream, I'm just going to familiarize myself with these brushes, 'cause I haven't used them in a while.",
    "My own brush pack I've been painting in different style and I might use this brush back in awhile so I want to take a look at what brushes I have here.",
    "These organic ones and see which one fits actually this one might be good.",
    "The new one.",
    "Oh, thank you.",
    "Nice green, thank you.",
    "Thank you.",
    "I am painting with a screen tablet.",
    "So it is a.",
    "It's like your monitor and then you can tilt it down and draw on it with a stylus.",
    "It was very difficult to do this kind of thing with a pen.",
    "I mean, without mouse and keyboard, because you your mouse doesn't have pressure sensitivity like the tablet.",
    "So this kind of setup allows me to press down harder and get either a bigger brush stroke or like darker, more opaque brushstroke.",
    "Things like that.",
    "I'm glad to hear that project.",
    "Well, cheers, I'm at the end of my T here.",
    "But also doing good.",
    "So we were talking a little bit earlier about textures and things and how it's often.",
    "But for me, I sort of see texture as, so it's kind of like the last thing it's.",
    "But it's fun and beautiful, but usually more focused on getting the I want to make sure that I'm getting the basic things right, and then we can come in and bring in fun textures and stuff at the end and details.",
    "So that's what we're going to be doing here.",
    "There we go.",
    "That's the pressure was looking for.",
    "Love looking at paintings with implied details.",
    "Yeah, I agree.",
    "I agree with that.",
    "Implied detail is is probably my favorite.",
    "So implied detail.",
    "Is referring to kind of like when you you often see it in like painterly style works where you can see the actual brush strokes.",
    "And the brush strokes will sort of have a texture to them and they start to look like something like.",
    "A bunch of like you make Bob Ross does it like he'll make use a brush stroke that suddenly looks all the little tiny speckles look like leaves or something like that.",
    "But he didn't sit there and draw all the leaves.",
    "He just used a brush stroke to make it look like that.",
    "That is my favorite kind of.",
    "Detail.",
    "This implies detail.",
    "Maybe I can do something more like that here.",
    "I was trying to.",
    "Pick out a foliage brush, but it looked too inconsistent with the rest of my painting because I just haven't been using those types of brushes so far and I don't know to me it really stands out as being like something different here and I would have had to start using brushes like that a little bit early on for them to fit in better.",
    "So there's a couple areas with little branches coming out like this in my experiment with that.",
    "It's it's kind of nice 'cause it gets a little bit of a starting point and then you can say OK.",
    "Well, where the branches coming from?",
    "Maybe there's a little sort of opening like a little pocket.",
    "Into the Bush and then we can add more.",
    "Detail around that area.",
    "There's so this is a hydrangea Bush, and there's some really beautiful Flowers here.",
    "I'm not sure if I like the direction this layer is going and so far, but I'm just going to keep going, so sometimes it's too early to tell and I don't give up too soon, so we're going to keep going.",
    "I'm going to add these little snowball snowball Flowers and I'm going to put a bunch more in.",
    "I'm just going to turn this whole Bush into a big hydrangea Bush.",
    "It might really be the Bush.",
    "Further past this one but.",
    "We're just going to add a bunch more Flowers because why not?",
    "We can our painting our world.",
    "And it's really, really lovely.",
    "So we've got pink and purple Flowers.",
    "And I probably shouldn't alternate them so perfectly.",
    "Looks a bit planned.",
    "Let's just be more random.",
    "And then we can.",
    "Add a bit of.",
    "Room light the Flowers.",
    "I'm still painting from zoomed out as much as I can.",
    "Even though we're getting into details.",
    "And with.",
    "Let's put the canvas.",
    "I think it's pretty.",
    "Hard to do in digital you have.",
    "I really agree.",
    "I've been working on that.",
    "There are ways there are ways.",
    "Thank you man.",
    "Hey Winter Night, Good morning or afternoon or evening.",
    "There you are hey.",
    "Yeah it is.",
    "Getting the because the evening now here.",
    "I'm doing good.",
    "I hope you're well.",
    "There are some little things, so I feel like implied details on one thing that I like to do that helps with that is the color dynamics brushes.",
    "So for example, if I take the brush and go to color dynamics, just check that box.",
    "Let's turn these settings up a little bit more.",
    "And then you do something like this.",
    "See all those stripes?",
    "It's infusing all these little colors, and so if I come here and paint on the Flowers now.",
    "It adds more little details than what I would have painted in myself and I think this is sort of an imply.",
    "It gives little little bit more detail.",
    "That's one thing.",
    "Do you think maybe this image would benefit from a figure may be sitting at the top of the steps?",
    "Yeah, I think this is the perfect kind of seen for like you know, I envisioned this is kind of a Ghibli Studio Ghibli style.",
    "Setting, so if we were to go along with that theme, I could see like you know, the main character of a movie, maybe like a little girl with the red.",
    "Had or something and like little cat next to her or something like that.",
    "That would be cute.",
    "I'm probably not going to be adding a person to the scene.",
    "And we don't really have.",
    "I don't really have enough time to do what I want to do with the environment and also add a figure, but I do think that would be a cute idea and a good at storytelling.",
    "Maybe we can add, maybe I could add a figure to it in another stream or other time.",
    "I use windows.",
    "Thank you, happy like it.",
    "So I'm using this brush stroke to look like little leaves and things, so it's another kind of implied detail attempt.",
    "And I want the.",
    "Voyage to extend out over the stairway.",
    "Morning for me.",
    "Take a break from streaming for a bit.",
    "Just got back from a road trip.",
    "I hope you had a good time.",
    "Good to see you too.",
    "I hope you had a good trip.",
    "Yeah, I for some reason I could see I feel like you could see a cat in this picture.",
    "Something like that walking up the steps.",
    "Um?",
    "For me, if I want to get good results adding something to the image, I probably wouldn't try winging it.",
    "You could, but I think I'd have better results.",
    "Deciding what we wanted to Adam going and searching up a reference then and doing it that way for best results.",
    "Right, I want a huge shift into a cooler green as we get closer to the viewer.",
    "There's also a deuce on a separate layer.",
    "There's, uh.",
    "Little like spider plant looking plants coming out like this.",
    "Let me turn on shape dynamics pen pressure so that will give me a pointy edge to my brush.",
    "The Flowers have done the job.",
    "Yay.",
    "I do think that they add the reference.",
    "The Flowers were just barely visible and I think it adds something.",
    "Having them a bit more prominent.",
    "I'm happy guys like it.",
    "Alright, I'm going to try this on a separate layer 'cause I don't know how it's going to go and I want to be able to modify it or.",
    "Like back out if we don't like it, but.",
    "We've got a lot of these, so this situation.",
    "This is the area that's a bit overexposed in Jackson was asking about this earlier, so now we get to deal with it.",
    "So I think maybe I'll paint in more green.",
    "To start off and then paint back in with the white and all the Overexposed area, because that way will see through.",
    "Too little cracks, typical little green splashes.",
    "A green will see that's my.",
    "My plan.",
    "So I want the as the leaves are reaching out, his son going to make them pretty bright.",
    "Drinking tea in front of your painting, which you paint the cool freeze please.",
    "Cool breeze coming right up.",
    "That's one of my favorite things actually in paintings is if you can see like the the foliage.",
    "Have a little bit of suede to it.",
    "Since I live in the Netherlands, it's very windy here.",
    "It's often you often see the bushes and trees.",
    "Being pushed around by the wind and blowing around.",
    "And it's really beautiful.",
    "So check it out in the reference.",
    "We've got at the moment.",
    "My concern is we have sort of an opposite value.",
    "Structure going on from the reference.",
    "Right now we move this over so you can see.",
    "So in the reference there's like really really bright light on the greens here and the stairs are darker behind that and in mind so far we've got green which is darker on top of the.",
    "On top of the stairs.",
    "Had you at that point?",
    "So I opened the brush palette and I went to under shape dynamics.",
    "I went to size jitter and put the control on pen pressure.",
    "So that makes it like this.",
    "We Yes, you have to check shape dynamics pen pressure and if everything looks like this then you're good to go.",
    "Went to Texas to see my parents still working on some traditional art.",
    "Will try to get back to learning how to use my computer for some digital art.",
    "Nice, I've been doing a lot of traditional art lately too.",
    "Right?",
    "So that's why we have all those windmills, yeah, mean cow.",
    "Joke about it.",
    "Sometimes that the windows are like creating the wind.",
    "Of course, it's it's not really the order of the whole situation.",
    "Anyway, I'm going to add some darker shadows under here.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Make a new layer.",
    "I'm going to know what we're going through the pure white.",
    "I'm just going to try it out.",
    "I just want to see what it's about.",
    "Pure white.",
    "OK, OK, we're going to let me go down a little bit off way.",
    "Because this is really bright.",
    "I'm sorry, keeps flipping my canvas, but I'm stuck on something trying to figure it out.",
    "That kind of helps me turn off color dynamics.",
    "And let's see what we get.",
    "We're going to try this a separate layer, yes?",
    "Do I have?",
    "Yeah direction OK.",
    "I'm going to switch to a different brush.",
    "I'm kind of looking for the fact that we were talking about earlier a little bit like calligraphy kind of effect, so I'm going to do the same thing here.",
    "We're going to turn shape dynamics on pen pressure and I'm going to turn off transfer 'cause I want it to be.",
    "Nice and solid.",
    "I think this will be a good brush for doing these kinds of.",
    "Plants.",
    "They look kind of like a ribbon.",
    "And there's big areas of light.",
    "So.",
    "An experiment with that I also want to try out what if the brightest part is the same color as this?",
    "Doesn't feel right.",
    "But I do feel like in the reference the color bouncing off of the.",
    "The stones is like the same as the color bouncing off of the plants, and that's creating a little bit of a disconnect here, so I'm going to make a new layer above the painting and I'm going to put it on.",
    "Let's try color Dodge.",
    "Let's do it, probably Dodge.",
    "Here we go.",
    "Oh, I need to double click the layer and we're going to put go unchecked.",
    "Transparency shapes layer.",
    "I prefer how color Dodge looks when this is unchecked suppress.",
    "OK, yeah, with Chloe.",
    "OK.",
    "So.",
    "Find the right color.",
    "Maybe more towards green.",
    "Cool and we're just going to.",
    "Brighten it up.",
    "It might be a bit overexposed, but.",
    "I think it looks cool.",
    "Trying to find that happy, happy place in between too much.",
    "Not enough.",
    "I think it's going well.",
    "The key with making things Glowy is not making everything glowy, but just making a couple places like much brighter than the rest.",
    "And then it really sets it off, like it's glowing.",
    "So.",
    "Lower the opacity a little bit.",
    "But now with this done, it makes the bees highlights seem, I think not so crazy.",
    "And we can add if we can add a little bit of like shading to them where the center is the brightest part.",
    "Something like that, so I think that's going better.",
    "So I will try to be brave and merge these down.",
    "I think I'll still keep the shines on a separate layer, but will merge down the other things so we can kind of turn this on and off and see what we've got.",
    "Thanks Winter night.",
    "I'm a big fan of that effect.",
    "And we also kind of going with the reverse and add a little bit more shadow to the.",
    "The part of step is facing towards us.",
    "That should probably be a little bit darker, but I don't know.",
    "Maybe blowies fine.",
    "Testing things out alright will go back to the other brush again.",
    "Let's try this one.",
    "So I want to add some highlights that aren't quite as crazy as that.",
    "The brightest colors the Wolf Gonna work your way up to it, and maybe that will also help.",
    "Part of the reason that I flipped this is because right handed, so it's a little bit easier for me to make these specific curve shape coming from the right.",
    "So that's part of language right now.",
    "Closest you can see the timer.",
    "And there's some different links.",
    "And there's some grouping.",
    "Flip it, take a look with the reference desolator area here.",
    "So I'm trying not to shy away from things looking a little bit messy, even though I have a tendency to be like no.",
    "We must organize.",
    "I'm going to turn on color dynamics again, but instead of applied for tip, I'm going to uncheck that so it's going to.",
    "Change the.",
    "Shade us a tiny bit with my brush strokes.",
    "Overexposed leaves need lower voice in my opinion.",
    "You think we should tone him down from the reference?",
    "You might be right.",
    "It's hard to say because.",
    "I don't want them to steal the show like I think that's what you're saying too, but I think part of the reason they look so intense right now is because there's some other areas in the scene that.",
    "I haven't added highlights yet and they will also be brighter and I think then it won't be so this won't be so overwhelming.",
    "But I don't know, but this is on a separate layer, so we'll just.",
    "I'm going to keep going and will assess.",
    "We'll see what we think.",
    "But as it is, yeah, I'm not really feeling exactly how it looks right now.",
    "I'm trying to just persevere 'cause I can tell.",
    "I think maybe I just need to keep going.",
    "I'm bringing a little bit more of a yellow green up here.",
    "And there's also other plants that kind of overlap some.",
    "And that will help a little bit.",
    "Feels far better, OK?",
    "I'll keep working on that.",
    "I think we can tone him down.",
    "I still want them to feel bright, 'cause I think they help show that how bright the sun is there, but yeah, it was a bit much.",
    "Well, I hope you guys are doing good.",
    "If anybody is painting along with me, I hope you're enjoying it.",
    "This is a bit of a tough one.",
    "But it's also really pretty scene.",
    "Alright, will flip again.",
    "So one thing looking at the reference and looking my at mine, one thing that I don't really like is how.",
    "Sort of uniform.",
    "They look like OK, let me show you.",
    "Look at this.",
    "There's a big area.",
    "It comes out.",
    "Very natural is kind of extends out, and there's another group here, another group here.",
    "This little space in between here and mine feels very like one row of these just sticking out and without a lot of interest.",
    "So I'm going to try to fix that.",
    "So we can extend out little further here.",
    "And I also want to create some shapes so there's a little bit of space in between.",
    "Here so we can bring this in.",
    "And then also here.",
    "So I'm going to see a little gap.",
    "And there's sort of a shape like this.",
    "That's one thing that I always have to fight against as an artist.",
    "I have a natural tendency, I think a lot.",
    "I don't think I'm Michael Owen with this, but.",
    "If I don't watch myself kinda just start making these shapes that are.",
    "Um?",
    "The same.",
    "Over and over again, and what I prefer is more natural looking.",
    "Difference like I want.",
    "I like things to be grouped up and then.",
    "Not just all the same difference distance from each other perfectly schedule.",
    "Went with overexposed look too.",
    "Not sure if it paid off yet.",
    "I think it's going to be nice.",
    "I think it's going to give a nice day time.",
    "Bright light feeling.",
    "Really enjoying painting along for this, even if it was very scary.",
    "First clears the.",
    "I'm so glad you did.",
    "I'm so glad.",
    "Also, I've been using a different brush for awhile down here.",
    "I wonder if I can bring back the original brush I was using on this painting, get some softer edges in here.",
    "Maybe I'll help with agloe look.",
    "Alright, I think I like it.",
    "Yeah, something about softer edges.",
    "It makes it look more like there's a little bit of a bloom like a light glow effect.",
    "And that feels.",
    "It was pretty.",
    "OK, I think I'm going to actually leave this area alone for a couple moments and work on somewhere else.",
    "Add a few of those will help really set this off.",
    "How fast are thank you, thank you, thank you.",
    "Those are fun to paint.",
    "I love those Flowers.",
    "I have a Bush.",
    "Oh my gosh, it's not a Bush.",
    "I mean it should be, but it's like a little.",
    "It's a little plant.",
    "I got a little hyped Ranger last year and if not happy my garden it's still alive but it's just.",
    "It didn't do that well over the winter, and I was kind of hoping it would come back this year and it's very small.",
    "It's alive, but it was very small.",
    "Is that 'cause I loved his plans but.",
    "This one needs all these little help.",
    "I'm not sure what it needs.",
    "Any sort of something?",
    "I could see it federal rolling at the top of the flight of stairs.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Bright green and I should probably create a brush to do this.",
    "Date today Let's see if I have a noisy brush.",
    "That I can use here.",
    "There's too many details.",
    "I don't have time there we go.",
    "I just want a bunch of dots.",
    "Up there.",
    "You guys paint on top if you want to blur in any blending in.",
    "Any brushes, texture brushes you use.",
    "Can you pee on top?",
    "Kind of still give it that hand painted look who's worked in some of the things you added.",
    "Alright, let's zoom out.",
    "So there are those Bush is, I think that's definitely.",
    "A big difference.",
    "Want to make this there a little bit more in.",
    "Even if we can add some.",
    "Details some of these little cracks kind of missed out on those.",
    "OK.",
    "So you can see we're going through working on areas still needing help our this, this.",
    "This is the main areas are going to work on, but I think they'll be fun.",
    "So this is the same kind of plant as we see in the foreground.",
    "The Crazy Overexposed.",
    "Mess these are kind of the same thing.",
    "I'm just sketching him in a little easier.",
    "And we will add.",
    "Nice bounce late.",
    "On top of these.",
    "Flip a clip from this side.",
    "So these here's a good opportunity.",
    "We have a lighter background so we can bring some of use.",
    "Overlapping outward.",
    "So it kind of gives a nice impression of what this plant looks like in an area of high contrast.",
    "The rest of it is a lot more.",
    "Monkey.",
    "Looking great man.",
    "He feels about it.",
    "Thank you Jackson.",
    "I'm happy with it.",
    "Honestly, I'm surprised that.",
    "I ended up going with a different workflow than I originally was planning on using for this, so I'm yeah I guess I'm ending up in a different place than I thought I was thinking.",
    "Originally I was going to go for like a watercolor look, but anyway I'm happy with it.",
    "I'm I'm glad it's it's.",
    "I think it's going pretty fast.",
    "Thank you Pavel's.",
    "Enjoy the rest of your day.",
    "See you later.",
    "Wanna go for a blue highlight on these?",
    "Oops, you later.",
    "And.",
    "I might have to lower the opacity tone down this layer, but I'm just going to paint it.",
    "First, 'cause it's a little easier for me to see.",
    "Oh Darius, I hope I hope not.",
    "Maybe there was some buffering or something.",
    "Um, my streaming software says that we're still connected, but.",
    "Maybe you got a little blip.",
    "Hopefully you can reload the page.",
    "So more this shine.",
    "So this is one of my favorite things in painting plans.",
    "I've noticed that.",
    "You know when plants are in the sun, you get this really nice yellow green look and a lot of big highlights.",
    "An almost pure white.",
    "Sometimes when the leaf is reflecting.",
    "But in the shadows you get you also have reflections of Weezer, shiny and even when they're in shadow will reflect like a green blueish green.",
    "Might like usually Sky.",
    "Getting about flight leaves and so pretty.",
    "So I can use an airbrush eraser and we saw a little bit.",
    "If you want to like soften those.",
    "Highlights of tab.",
    "I think it's pretty.",
    "I don't want to take them away.",
    "But I think it's nice to accentuate a couple that are really bright and rather than having everything.",
    "Really great.",
    "OK, so if we're looking at the reference, there's some interesting things happening behind this group.",
    "Um?",
    "We have dark shadow like I have so far.",
    "Then we have some bright light coming through 'cause I've got all sorts of plans here.",
    "An light hitting them an like layering and stuff so we've got some real bright light.",
    "Back here and then that allows for a silhouette to happen of these darker leaves that are going to come down in front of this area, so that's going to be the next project.",
    "IoD Rumaysa how you doing?",
    "So adding the brighter areas.",
    "And then we'll add darker.",
    "So because I've been hand painting most of the details, I think I'm going to continue doing that even though I do have some foliage brushes that I think would work for these type of leaves.",
    "I think I will just paint it in out of T.",
    "OK.",
    "So another thing is if we look closely at the reference, you can see that these leaves are pretty dark underneath and shadow an later on top.",
    "So something to pay attention to.",
    "So here we go.",
    "What I'm going to do to help me is draw a couple branches.",
    "That way I can make the leaves kind of coming off of there and gives me a place to start.",
    "And then I'll make my brush larger.",
    "And just kind of.",
    "I'm kind of trying to recreate this effect that I do in watercolor.",
    "I don't know.",
    "I haven't been really.",
    "It's been really hard to get this effect in digital, but in watercolor I'll like to take a brush and like make one leaf with the brush and you can kind of make it.",
    "You can create this really pretty leaf shapes but really struggling to get that.",
    "In digital so.",
    "Maybe instead.",
    "We could do it with the lasso tool.",
    "Because then you can make these really nice shape so that part of the problem with my brushes.",
    "I'm just not creating shapes that have these hard edges and these really sharp beautiful leaf shapes where they get nice and wide and then.",
    "You have a beautiful shape at the end of beautiful point at the end.",
    "So for example, you can make a selection like that and then fill it in.",
    "And I really like those shapes better than I can do with the brush.",
    "It just so stark an intense.",
    "So.",
    "I do have.",
    "A brush this brush can kind of.",
    "Yeah, it's just.",
    "The other objects are option is to hand paint them.",
    "And just make the leaf shades.",
    "I find that if you go over it with.",
    "Color that really fits into the scene.",
    "You can kind of get away with it.",
    "The hard edges, as long as there's not too much contrast.",
    "All right?",
    "Let's try it.",
    "Let's just try it.",
    "So I'm not going to worry too much about shading first, just going to shape, so I'm going to select a bunch of leaves and some of them are grouped up, so I'm going to try to consider that when I make my selection and I'm not going to select a million leaves yet those will be like around the edges, but I'm going to make these groups like this and then fill those in an we can do shadows first, maybe.",
    "I hope you guys are able to see me.",
    "OK, I got a little notification that the connection was unstable or something, so I'm sorry about that.",
    "I'm not sure.",
    "With the problem, but I hope.",
    "You can still see me.",
    "I'm sorry if that's it might be on my end, but.",
    "Will just try to keep going and hopefully will be able to finish up the stream.",
    "These leaves are largely like spread out.",
    "Horizontally.",
    "Rather than up and down.",
    "I think my leaf shapes are a little large.",
    "Could do something like this.",
    "Also, here's a Photoshop trick.",
    "I'm sure you guys are familiar with.",
    "We can just duplicate and sort of rotate.",
    "We can go to edit, transform, flip horizontal.",
    "I will definitely reuse stuff like this if I'm in a pinch and.",
    "You can rotate and resize it so that you really can't notice.",
    "You just gotta be creative.",
    "And.",
    "There you go.",
    "It doesn't always work, but sometimes you can stream seems fine.",
    "OK, thank you project.",
    "Thank you, Michael.",
    "I'm glad I don't know whether what it was.",
    "OK, thanks Jackson.",
    "We're good.",
    "I would like to visit this place.",
    "Seems very relaxing.",
    "I have to go to Japan one day.",
    "Definitely on the bucket list.",
    "OK, thank you interni.",
    "Thanks Foster.",
    "Alright, I'm glad.",
    "It's so funny sometimes the stream will have a problem with no warning and other times there's a warning and no problem.",
    "You never know what's going to happen with the technology stuff.",
    "I like how this is actually looking, although it kind of looks like a bunch of birds.",
    "You guys kena it.",
    "Looks to me it looks like a bunch of birds flying away.",
    "But this is later one.",
    "Shadows were going to highlight the top of some of these leaves.",
    "Oops.",
    "Copy paste.",
    "Me.",
    "Alright, if we zoom out, how is this going?",
    "Well, my shape isn't quite isn't right on, but it'll work.",
    "Duplicate it and.",
    "Like I feel like it needed to come out further.",
    "It's kind of like that silhouette.",
    "And I'll just get rid of a couple of years.",
    "Ah, thanks Andy.",
    "I'm glad you like it.",
    "Japan is slowly on my bucket list to visit.",
    "Yeah, definitely my sister went there for her honeymoon and had an amazing time I was very happy for her.",
    "She got to go.",
    "So I was like living vicariously through all her pictures.",
    "Let's settle foliage is I'm a fan.",
    "They look great.",
    "OK, I'm trying this office like there's too many.",
    "There we go.",
    "OK.",
    "So let's add some highlights.",
    "This should be fun.",
    "Highlights are always fun.",
    "So I'm going to make a selection.",
    "Will do five separate layer, make a selection and these are going to be mostly leaves that are facing down 'cause I don't think it would make sense really.",
    "Otherwise we're only going to see the light tops of the leaves are facing down.",
    "Alright, let's test this out, so I'm going to grab a color.",
    "Oh, that's too late.",
    "Let's not down a bit.",
    "Something like that.",
    "Hum.",
    "OK, so I'm going to go back to this layer an lock it lock the layer.",
    "And at a little bit of.",
    "Shading to these leaves.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Oh, you're having trouble pro.",
    "I'm sorry about that.",
    "Maybe you could try refreshing if you haven't already.",
    "So I'm going to be painting on top of this and we're going to lose some of our fresh sharp edges.",
    "But I don't see another way.",
    "Be collecting fans from around the world.",
    "Since I was a child, a teacher in grade school introduced Japan to us and I sort of fell in love with Japan.",
    "We turn now he I had this same experience that's so crazy.",
    "That's so cute.",
    "I actually have.",
    "I have something like that, but it's for.",
    "It's like a a water container for traditional painting and it's yeah it has that little thing for putting your paintbrush in on top.",
    "That's so cool.",
    "Yeah, I'm really.",
    "I really enjoy sushi and Japanese food that I've had so far.",
    "I got a kind of into cooking Japanese recipes for awhile, so I was like searching up different ones on on YouTube and stuff.",
    "It's fun to make.",
    "I like making this little rice balls onigiri.",
    "I don't know if that's how you pronounce it properly.",
    "But Michael Valley, thank you.",
    "I think this is really turning into one of my favorite ones in awhile, but there's still some little areas, but I need to be sorted out, but thank you.",
    "Someone needs to make little clip on's for the Bolt but the chopsticks on.",
    "Yeah, that would be convenient.",
    "So some of these leaves have a little bit of staffeld lighting on the little little light patches actually on the leaves.",
    "So I want to paint those in.",
    "But I don't want to mess up the leaf shapes, so just be careful.",
    "Right winter night, it kind of makes me want to get into doing with pottery or something ceramics.",
    "Not that I need something like that to get into right now, but it would be fun to make your own little things like that art supplies little holders for things.",
    "I'd love to design my own paint palette.",
    "That would be so much fun.",
    "Alright, I'm coming back over here to the foreground to the crazy bright leaves.",
    "We can make some more sense of this.",
    "I really want to get just some interesting groupings.",
    "By project, thank you.",
    "Thank you for hanging out.",
    "Have a good day.",
    "Well, for those of you painting along, I hope it's going well.",
    "I just notice what time it was.",
    "Oh my gosh.",
    "OK, so here's the thing.",
    "I really I actually really like this.",
    "I think I'm gonna probably spend some more time on it post stream, but the sake of getting something nice or hopefully feeling feeling a bit more finished by the end.",
    "Here I'm just going to sketch in some areas that are a bit forgotten at the moment.",
    "So like for example up here.",
    "On the top left.",
    "Let's get some more details.",
    "So just start blocking in the so there's a on the top left.",
    "The leaves are, they're not actually all the way back here.",
    "There are closer to us, but they're blurred out.",
    "So that's interesting.",
    "I think maybe the easiest thing is is just to imagine them instead, like that their further back.",
    "From paint them back here.",
    "I don't know if that's the way to go.",
    "I kind of like all the light coming from back there though, making it this glowing this beautiful glowy thing.",
    "So maybe making it a pretty bright and then having darker leaves come down just kind of like what's going on with this tree over here.",
    "Turn off color dynamics.",
    "And we're going to be affected, it it it it it it it?",
    "Something tons of little leaves.",
    "But then you get that nice.",
    "Silhouette contrast, you know you get these little tiny darker we've popping in front of the later.",
    "Background Bush is is really pretty.",
    "Get the illusion of a lot more detail.",
    "Is an area to focus your eyes.",
    "And we can kind of do the same with the highlights.",
    "Really, really bright areas want to overdo it, but there really are bright areas here and get that to really good feeling of glow.",
    "Like me through I love the subsurface scattering affect the plants get.",
    "How glow Italy's are.",
    "And that's happening all up here.",
    "And down here too.",
    "Um?",
    "After all this talking about are in Japan, I realized I have a bamboo calligraphy brush.",
    "Need to find it since I've been organizing my art supplies in one room.",
    "Oh, I used to have one.",
    "It wasn't a very expensive one or anything, but I really liked it.",
    "For painting.",
    "I didn't still use it for writing actual clever calligraphy.",
    "But I liked it for painting.",
    "Things out of focus are much closer and not the back.",
    "Yeah, I agree.",
    "Yeah, but I think in mine I'm probably going to just.",
    "Have to make it like distant distant tree.",
    "Because.",
    "I don't know if I would like how that effect would look if I tried to do it in my painting.",
    "So we're just going to re imagine it differently.",
    "We could put, you know, again, we could come back in with like a branch closer branch coming in front, but I would make it more crisp looking.",
    "And not.",
    "Blurred out, probably it's something you can't do.",
    "Blurry effects in digital painting like you absolutely can, but I don't think it would work with the mood 'cause it's I'm trying to go for more of like a traditional kind of.",
    "5 and then those blurry effects are very digital feeling.",
    "To me.",
    "You guys are right.",
    "And welcome back entry.",
    "We also drawing somewhere.",
    "At all.",
    "Branches coming out here just leave him out.",
    "Yeah, I I feel like I have to do something up there because if I don't have something up there then I see totally imagine the architecture going off to the side.",
    "Maybe I could try that.",
    "Um?",
    "Or I could just have.",
    "Just put like a tree, kind of like what's going on over here on the left.",
    "Kind of just repeat that kind of tree over there maybe.",
    "I think that's that.",
    "Might be a good option.",
    "Oops, I can extend the architecture a little bit more into this area and then.",
    "Have that tree type thing.",
    "It's a tree.",
    "OK.",
    "Open up the hand paint little squares.",
    "Well, if anybody is painting along.",
    "And you want to share a finished picture or you want to share like a work in progress?",
    "If you still want to work on it more you can.",
