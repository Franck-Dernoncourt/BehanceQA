    "Hey guys were back.",
    "Sorry for the issues, were having some trouble getting connected to the server, but hopefully we're going to stay connected.",
    "Now I'm going to try this is I know it's a little tough to watch the stream like this, but we're going to try our best to get some time to hang out together.",
    "An yeah if it shuts down again then maybe I will take a break for the day.",
    "Maybe I'll try streaming again and a few hours but I think.",
    "Yeah, but I'm going to try to do is will go through now and hopefully be able to continue smoothly.",
    "But if it shuts down I will probably stay stay offline.",
    "And if you want to hear any updates about if I'll be going live again or not, you can check my Twitter or my discord.",
    "The link to my discord should be in the the description.",
    "Below the stream and so you can keep in touch there about when I'll be going live.",
    "Um?",
    "Hey, I cash it's I'm having trouble connecting.",
    "There's some issues going on with the I think might be issues going on with the hand server.",
    "Everything seems OK with My Internet but you never know there's a lot of variables so sometimes these things happen.",
    "It's live stream problems.",
    "It happens, but no we were not purposely ending the stream here.",
    "This is not supposed to be happening.",
    "Yeah, so let's continue with the painting and hopefully will get through it again if I if I do shut down again, I'm probably going to end it there.",
    "And you can check out my socials for updates on if we're going to be streaming again later today or not, and otherwise otherwise, we'll just.",
    "We'll just call it for the day.",
    "I know it's hard for everyone to watch like this, so.",
    "Um?",
    "I do.",
    "I do also stream on Twitch Cornell.",
    "Actually I stream here and be hands every Wednesday and I stream some other days on Twitch.",
    "I also stream traditional art so.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Alright, let's get back into it.",
    "If anybody is painting along, I hope it's going well and I hope your hope you're enjoying your painting.",
    "So.",
    "Let's see where were we?",
    "We're working on for me what I'm doing right now is working on values, so I turned my painting into black and white and took a peek there an so that gave me some hints on what I need to work on.",
    "Also down here at the where the garden and the dirt kind of meets up.",
    "I want a little bit more of a gradual.",
    "Thing going on down there like I want to add some little little patches of dirt or little patches of shadow.",
    "It just seems right now.",
    "Is it?",
    "Abrupt end?",
    "So we'll try to get this one spruced up, so I'm adding some shadows shadows under the.",
    "Under the Bush is shadows under the stairway.",
    "Bring in some of the darker values finally.",
    "There is also a rail I'll do this on another layer.",
    "There's a railing.",
    "It's also really bright nice.",
    "Bright light hitting there.",
    "And so this is all on its own layer, so it's nice 'cause we can apply either a clipping mask or we can use a lock transparency.",
    "So I'm going to go to the checkerboard icon, press that down, and now I can paint any color that I want.",
    "Hey guys, I hope you're able to see me.",
    "Sorry about that abrupt ending of the stream, but we're back there.",
    "It seems like there's a little bit of trouble.",
    "I was having a little bit of trouble connecting with the server, but.",
    "It seems like we are good now.",
    "I'll keep an eye on things in my in O PS, but hopefully will be able to just continue on from here without too much trouble.",
    "So we will just pick up where we left off.",
    "I didn't get a chance to upload all of the reference images again, they should be below the streaming description.",
    "But let me let me at least put the one where we're doing right now.",
    "In the info tab and I'll just put them there one by one when we go to the next scene.",
    "But I hope you guys are able to see and hear me if if there's anything weird going on there, let me know.",
    "Hello, we're back.",
    "Thanks guys welcome Koons Ryan Barack, thank you, sorry about that.",
    "So we'll just continue.",
    "We were just starting the sketch for this first reference image.",
    "So I will pick it up right there.",
    "Let's go, let's go.",
    "So we've got this layer alright.",
    "So working on proportions just get trying to get the mean.",
    "I mean proportions or placement of things on the House.",
    "So it's OK if it's not 100% perfect.",
    "This isn't an architectural rendering, so we just kind of want to get the feeling of it an.",
    "That we can do free hand I think.",
    "Hi Robert, Welcome.",
    "Welcome welcome.",
    "Yeah, things seemed to be going better.",
    "Right, so we've got the roof little tile roof.",
    "And there's going to be a bunch of plants.",
    "That's something that really attracted me to this scene.",
    "Is this cheerful little Bush is and flowering plants.",
    "So I like this shape in the front of this.",
    "This one type of Bush that's kind of rounded looking and.",
    "Very very small little leaves so it almost looks like one solid green fuzzy shape from the distance.",
    "And I mean we can go all the way down here or something like that and then above that there's another.",
    "So this is where I might start to erase away the shape underneath where we no longer need that line.",
    "All race that away so it's easier for me to see what I'm doing and then we'll.",
    "Had some more little Bush is.",
    "There's a flower group of Flowers here, so as you can see, I'm just putting in the shape of what these the shape.",
    "The area that these plants are going to take up, rather than drawing the actual plant.",
    "It just kind of drawing it outline space for them, so ends up looking very cartoony, which is kind of fun.",
    "But I'm just trying to block in the area that I know I'm going to use for painting these these plans.",
    "So.",
    "He's big, Flowery Bush is up here.",
    "They're going to have a little bit more texture, be a little bit more random.",
    "So we do see the line of that house over there.",
    "OK, and the stairs I should probably pay a little bit of attention to these.",
    "Make sure that they make sense.",
    "Perspective Wise.",
    "OK, that'll work, I think.",
    "Hi Akash, welcome.",
    "Welcome anyone who's just getting here.",
    "I can make these this railing any color that I want, so I'm going to use a little bit of A.",
    "Um?",
    "Little bit of a shadow, a little bit of an off white color.",
    "Maybe a little bit towards blue.",
    "Might be pretty.",
    "Welcome back Anthony.",
    "Sorry about that, sorry about that.",
    "I'm glad you found your way back.",
    "OK, so we've got our stairway and it's casting a little bit of a shadow onto the.",
    "The stairs.",
    "And do something like this.",
    "Do you do?",
    "I think that's kind of cool.",
    "And then this meets up with the road.",
    "So if you guys have any questions about anything I'm doing, welcome to let me know.",
    "Going to flip the canvas over here and I'll flip my reference whenever I flip the canvas.",
    "I'm also flipping my reference on the other monitor.",
    "So it's really hard to do that without flipping.",
    "It's really hard to like.",
    "Just envision the reference flipped so I do flip it.",
    "I'm I'm not flipping, flipping the little thumbnail up top.",
    "But I am flipping the reference on my other monitor.",
    "So at this stage in the painting, I feel like we can get the idea.",
    "Now it starts to come together.",
    "The look that you get from this kind of Workflow.",
    "It's starting to starting to finally come together earlier on in the process.",
    "It's very messy with this whole sort of traditional style doing under painting, painting over it, having all that orange showing.",
    "Even now there's still a lot of orange showing that we got to tone down, but I think we're starting to get to the phase where you can see.",
    "Some of the benefits of it.",
    "We can see that it's.",
    "It's becoming cleaner and it has a nice look, but it takes it takes a little while.",
    "To get to this stage so you gotta like just have faith in the early stages that you're going to get here.",
    "Bring a brighter color green.",
    "Looking like individual leaves on this.",
    "This Bush here.",
    "More detail.",
    "Can turn on color dynamics a little bit more dramatic.",
    "We'll get some interesting colors and some lighter colors that look like light shining off the leaves.",
    "You can get pretty bright.",
    "You can put almost a white to show the idea of light shining off leaves 'cause they can be really reflective.",
    "And I see some warm color too in that Bush.",
    "Maybe it's Flowers, maybe it's little little twigs or some Brown leaves.",
    "I mean, I don't know, but it gives a nice variation.",
    "Alright, this little area needs a little bit of love.",
    "We've got shadows here.",
    "Purple shadows, that's where the.",
    "The mailbox is going to be oh you guys.",
    "At some point I accidentally merged down my sketch layer so the sketch is now a permanent part of the painting that wasn't on purpose, but Luckily I had my sketch layer at such a low opacity is it doesn't really make a difference.",
    "That's actually something that I do purposely when I'm painting portraits.",
    "You can find the reference images below.",
    "The stream in the description if you want to take a look at them or if you want to join in and sketching.",
    "So there's something here I'm not sure what exactly that is.",
    "I think it's something to do with the water drain pipe, so.",
    "Yeah, we'll sketch it in.",
    "There's a little birdhouse that's Cute.",
    "Somewhere over here.",
    "Cute little birdhouse.",
    "That's the kind of thing that you know.",
    "Or maybe, maybe it's even a mailbox.",
    "Might be actually mailbox.",
    "That kind of looks like a birdhouse.",
    "Yeah, I think that's what it is.",
    "Funny.",
    "Yeah, but we could add in an extra little, you know those little little details that you can sort of exaggerate if you like them.",
    "Maybe I'll add a couple of bird houses or something.",
    "I think this is the kind of house that would have preferred times.",
    "I've got a big fluffy Bush over here.",
    "Something like this?",
    "And got a little bit of A.",
    "Like a rose Bush or something, but you know, we could add some fines crawling up the house.",
    "A little artistic license there.",
    "I like these plants over here.",
    "There's some.",
    "Plans with a different type of leaf like sort of like a palm leaf type plant.",
    "Warlock works perfectly fine.",
    "Oh, you want me to call you Warlock?",
    "You can change your name here to Warlock if you want.",
    "It's really hard for me to like.",
    "Remember when people want me to call them something different than their name in the chat.",
    "It's just.",
    "It's just hard for me to register that I'll try my best, but you can actually change your name here if you want to be called something different.",
    "That way it'll be easier for people to call you that.",
    "I Samuel, what drawing tools are you using?",
    "I am using a Wakeham Centriq 22 that is my drawing tablet.",
    "I'll type it in the.",
    "The chat.",
    "How often would you say you exaggerate or make stuff up off pattern?",
    "Oh, OK, so historically I would say not that often, but more and more lately I have been trying to get comfortable going off the reference here and there and personalizing things a bit.",
    "I felt a little bit less comfortable doing it when I.",
    "Yeah, when I was kind of newer to this and I felt like well when I would try to go off the reference.",
    "My I didn't like the results I but as I've gotten more practice and more experience, I feel like I can go go off the reference a little bit more successfully.",
    "So I've been trying to experiment with that more and more lately.",
    "So yeah, it has been happening.",
    "I would say I would say with each painting there's possibility that change something on a very minor scale, like adding extra flower Bush or something like that.",
    "But when it comes to big changes, I would say I don't do a lot of big changes when I'm doing studies 'cause then.",
    "Yeah, I'm really trying to just learn from what's there, but I am starting to change little things more and more to my preferences.",
    "I'm hoping that that's something I will get better at doing and get more comfortable doing the more I do this, so I would like to do it more.",
    "Alright, I'm going to zoom in a little bit.",
    "Bring this down.",
    "And get caught up often feeling like I'm cheating.",
    "If I go off the reference.",
    "Oh, that's funny.",
    "It's interesting how people have different.",
    "Like for some people they have to fight the urge.",
    "Like for me if anything I have to fight the urge more often or the feeling more often that I'm cheating.",
    "If I do follow the reference.",
    "And now now I want to just be clear on this.",
    "That's sort of like a.",
    "That's something that used to bother me.",
    "Earlier on when I had kind of a misconception that artists had to like, create everything from scratch and the misunderstanding about references, then I had that sort of feeling.",
    "Nowadays I I have a very different view on that and I understand the most professional artists are using reference most of the time at least to inform their work, even if they're not recreating that scene exactly.",
    "They're using that as a very strongly as a guide for how to do a good lighting, or how to paint this kind of.",
    "Animal, like it's it's totally a regular, normal and a good part of a process to to use reference, but I used to be more on the other side of things and think like I had to come up with everything on my own so now I'm happy to be more on that side the other side.",
    "Um?",
    "I cash is better, I thought were luck would be easier for you.",
    "That's my name on Twitch.",
    "Now I know who you now I know who you are and that's good.",
    "I'll try my best to yeah if I can call you at cash then that's easier for me.",
    "When I'm painting portraits, I do like to merge my sketch layer onto the painting.",
    "So.",
    "That's an option of a workflow.",
    "Well, we're doing it here now.",
    "The other spin the image of an angle to make strokes or lines easier to draw.",
    "I do not I know that that's a really common thing to do an I got out of the habit of doing it.",
    "So part of the reason is before he started live streaming, I used to instead of live streaming.",
    "I would.",
    "I would record tutorial videos that kind of pre recorded process videos and one of the things that I notice, twas it would be really annoying to watch for people that were trying to watch the sped up video when the image was like moving around so much.",
    "You know what I mean when you're going to update it and stuff like that when you speed up.",
    "A video like that it gets really crazy, like in real time it's no problem, but when you speed it up it looks a little wild, so I used to.",
    "I so I got out of the habit of using that because of those videos making those videos and now I never do it anymore like I just never got out of the habit of it.",
    "I never think to do it for me.",
    "Flipping the canvas horizontally is like enough.",
    "I never need to turn it this way or that way.",
    "Ha ha.",
    "Ryan, the sketch layer that's so funny.",
    "It's no problem, though, you know.",
    "Average over the schedule later.",
    "Yes, please.",
    "Yeah, sketches now with us forever.",
    "Whether we like it or not, this Calculator is here to stay.",
    "Those are funny.",
    "That's the thing.",
    "Yeah so anyway.",
    "Got another pipe coming down here.",
    "You can use shift to make a straight line.",
    "Sometimes I have to do that 'cause I can't draw a straight line.",
    "Here we go.",
    "I really like using purple and shadows when it's a nice sunny day.",
    "Think it's really pretty.",
    "They've got a couple little say utility.",
    "Pipes and things.",
    "Random little box, some kind of meter.",
    "I kind of like drawing in these little details.",
    "I know that they're not always most aesthetic, but it overall gives an impression that somebody lives here, you know.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Alright, so.",
    "Let's bring some of these on a new layer, which I will not merge down yet, be careful.",
    "We're going to bring some of these.",
    "Wires here and there.",
    "On the roof.",
    "Different in Denison thicknesses of the wires.",
    "Some coming over here.",
    "Hum.",
    "And we'll have to decide if we want to include all of them.",
    "I mean, maybe it's a little bit much.",
    "Kind of a lot, actually.",
    "So I like the idea of making these two little closer together up at the top rather than having one of them actually cut down in front of the house.",
    "I think maybe that's a little bit nicer.",
    "So.",
    "Will do that.",
    "Oh, thank you.",
    "You are a like how you can make a pretty plainish reference into your really beautiful painting.",
    "Your colors and plants look very appealing.",
    "Thank you.",
    "That's really nice to hear.",
    "'cause yeah, it's hard for me to remember to say something else when I'm reading your name.",
    "So if you're good with it I'm good with it.",
    "We are doing right now.",
    "Let's see where this one is.",
    "We've got a few different countries represented in our studies today.",
    "This is do I think we're in.",
    "North northwest Spain right now.",
    "That's where this house is located.",
    "If you want.",
    "If you look below the stream in the description, the first link there is the map crunch.",
    "Link to this location so you can actually click on that and like sort of wander around the area if you want.",
    "If you want to like, take a closer look you can.",
    "OK, so I better get going with the painting 'cause I'm having way too much fun with this sketch.",
    "We're going to run out of time if I keep going on this.",
    "Hey David, good to see you welcome.",
    "That actually, that's true too.",
    "Guess I swap back and forth.",
    "Gotta be less Harden ourselves.",
    "I know, right?",
    "It's true artist so it can be really it.",
    "We can be really ourselves.",
    "Not very, very high expectations.",
    "Trying to get comfortable with the learning process and the mistakes that come along with it.",
    "OK, like these, these little houses in the background here.",
    "Do Brazil.",
    "I would definitely be open to that if you guys find any good images from an area you'd like me to paint using the.",
    "Using a map crunch or pixels and Unsplash those those are Rosie free images we can use.",
    "You're welcome to post.",
    "There's a there's a channel in the discord suggest suggest references.",
    "Yeah, suggest topics you can post that stuff in there if you want and will consider it for upcoming upcoming streams.",
    "One of the ones I have today is from Singapore and that was somebody requested Singapore last week.",
    "So I do try to take the suggestions into account.",
    "OK, so.",
    "Will put this layer on multiply an lower the opacity of the layer so we can barely see it.",
    "I'm going to be painting this with just the sketch as a guide.",
    "Will see if the.",
    "We'll see if the sketch ends up being.",
    "In the final one, usually not, usually, not for me.",
    "Haicheng, oh, don't worry, we're going to do more sketches depending on how much time you have to hang out those today planning to do, I'm going to attempt doing four of these studies so they'll be more sketching going on for the next one.",
    "Hi Elena, thank you.",
    "I hope you have a good day too.",
    "Good to see you.",
    "So I've been experimenting with a little bit more of a traditional workflow lately, so that includes doing full like underpainting and everything, so I choose a color usually.",
    "If I'm painting a sunny scene, it's going to be something like this.",
    "It's going to be something like a warm glow color that gives a feeling of a warm glow and just sketch that in in the background like this.",
    "I hate Francesco, welcome.",
    "No worries.",
    "We only just started.",
    "There's a lot of stream left to go, so it's you're here at a good time.",
    "Don't worry.",
    "Thank you for coming over.",
    "And then we're going to start with painting the Sky.",
    "So I like to paint the Sky first for a few reasons.",
    "I feel like it helps set the.",
    "Set the tone for the whole painting the whole scene.",
    "Because the Sky is going to tell us about the time of day, about the weather, about the overall mood and lighting.",
    "So we do the Sky 1st and then we're set up to have, you know will be able to know what kind of colors to paint, everything else, how the light is going to affect those other objects.",
    "So that's why I like to do this guy first.",
    "Also, generally it's the furthest thing away an I like to work back to front.",
    "Layering so that also makes sense.",
    "So I try to create a little bit of a gradient in the Sky, but painting with A textured brushes a little bit harder to get a gradient.",
    "You can always do it with a big airbrush and that'll be nice and smooth.",
    "A Samuel says when creating, do you use this screen on your tablet and a larger screen like a computer or laptop?",
    "I'm looking into cheaper alternatives like the welcome intuos pro, yes, so my setup is the I have the Wakeham Centriq 22 so it's a screen tablet so I'm drawing on the screen and then I do use another monitor also.",
    "Actually when I first was getting into digital I had my centriq one other monitor.",
    "I'm streaming, I got another monitor so I have two extra monitors other than my tablet because I have the streaming software and other things on there you don't necessarily need that for me.",
    "And we have to add the Flowers and still.",
    "So we have that to look forward to.",
    "Maybe I'll get into that now.",
    "Hey red welcome, sorry about that, welcome back.",
    "Welcome in.",
    "Let's add some Flowers that will be nice.",
    "So yeah, we can.",
    "One thing I'll do real quick before that is one of these wires up here.",
    "We actually get like a pretty strong light hitting the wire, so while that's on its own layer will come down like this.",
    "And add that highlight.",
    "I find those kind of things really satisfying and it makes.",
    "Makes the wire really feel 3D really pops out towards us without light hitting so.",
    "I think that.",
    "We could also get a.",
    "Pretty bright detail on top of the house here.",
    "Go to control Z for that perfect brush strokes.",
    "There we go.",
    "Alright, will merge those.",
    "And new layer for the Flowers.",
    "All right, these are going to be really pretty.",
    "We're going to really bright magenta, really bright.",
    "We might start with, yet we'll start with this color.",
    "And.",
    "Just paint little flower groups and almost looks unreal bright.",
    "But I mean, hey, that's what they look like.",
    "There's also some climbing up the wall here.",
    "I forgot to draw those little leaves will add them in.",
    "So that we can explain those Flowers, there's some down here.",
    "I don't know if they're all the same kind of plant, but these guys are everywhere.",
    "I love it.",
    "And up here tons of long now these are bit further away so you can kind of just make one brush stroke for a group of Flowers.",
    "And we're going to give some different variation of color too.",
    "I don't think it needs much 'cause they're really bright and kind of.",
    "Yeah, there's not too many different variations, but for example will go a little bit darker.",
    "Darker and cooler add some shadows so around the bigger groups or in the area where there's like a darker green we can imagine that there would be Flowers in shadow there so we can use this darker color.",
    "And then maybe we can make it brighter color.",
    "So color pic again from the original magenta and let's go a little bit brighter.",
    "Might be a stupid question.",
    "What kind of brush are using here for blending?",
    "Um, I'm not sure what I was doing when you ask me that question.",
    "If you're talking about the Flowers.",
    "I'm using a rectangle texture brush that I've made.",
    "The one that was what was I doing before?",
    "I'm not sure what I was doing.",
    "When you may have asked that.",
    "But You can let me know if I was painting a specific thing.",
    "I'll try to answer it, but I'm using these custom brushes that I've been working on that I will make available as soon as I can as soon as they're ready.",
    "I want to make a little tutorial video to go along with them so.",
    "It's taking a little time, but.",
    "They will be available soon.",
    "Try to remember what I was doing right before that.",
    "But yeah, I'm using a.",
    "There's a brush that similar to this one in the free brush back that you can download for me below the stream in the description it's called.",
    "It's called the rectangle texture brush.",
    "There's a very similar brush to this in that in that pack.",
    "If you're looking for something that will do the job, this will be very similar.",
    "So I'm going to select this group of Flowers here on the left.",
    "I don't know if my eyes are just.",
    "I don't know if I'm imagining this, but I feel like those Flowers are a little bit more towards red, like a little bit more towards red, orange and then these over here more magenta.",
    "I just seen that, so I'm going to.",
    "Q shift them a tiny bit.",
    "And I also want to add a brighter green.",
    "I feel like these Flowers are standing out as being like super super bright compared to the Bush.",
    "The color of the plant that they're coming out of.",
    "So I want to add some brighter green so I feel like the lighting makes more sense.",
    "But I am like concerned that those Flowers in the Bush I want them to match the rest of the painting.",
    "I was doing great with one monitor and my synthetic and that was like a great setup.",
    "So, but yeah, that's what I use.",
    "Yeah, so that depends on the person Samuel.",
    "So when it comes to having a screen, tablet or non screen tablet alot of professional artists use the Intuos line.",
    "The one you're talking about.",
    "It has a great pressure sensitivity.",
    "That's the most important thing.",
    "A lot of people say that they get.",
    "You get used to drawing sort of drawing on the mouse pad kind of thing looking up at the screen but you get used to that overtime.",
    "I personally thought it was difficult.",
    "I had borrowed an intuos from a friend and tried it out.",
    "And I ended up saving up and getting SMT 'cause I found it difficult.",
    "However, I that was a very brief experiment with the intuos.",
    "I think if I had maybe stuck with it and kept working with it to get through that initial awkwardness, maybe it would have been fine for me.",
    "It's hard to say 'cause usually when I talk to people, that's what they say.",
    "It was weird for awhile and then they got used to it.",
    "So it depends on your budget.",
    "If and what you want to do there, there's a lot of options.",
    "Alright, well let's go on to the house.",
    "I just want to get everything blocked in in a simple way as soon as possible.",
    "So what I try to do is work.",
    "Like I said back to front but also big to small.",
    "So the next thing that I'm doing after the Sky is looking at what should I do next?",
    "And so I'm thinking these houses or the are very big shapes and their important.",
    "I mean this is what the scene is about really.",
    "So I'm going to try and block these in pretty quick.",
    "And I'm looking at subtle color shifts.",
    "The This area close to us that looks like a little bit of a shed or something that's attached to the house.",
    "This one has a little bit of a blue kind of tint to it.",
    "This building back here is a little bit of the Brown.",
    "It is differentiating a little bit and the style that I'm going for is kind of.",
    "A little bit of like a plane air.",
    "Egg wash type painting style.",
    "This is I started getting into this.",
    "This medium in traditional and it's definitely influenced my taste in digital art.",
    "I've been trying to.",
    "Kind of match my digital art to that traditional vibe.",
    "Do you need performing computer to work with this antique?",
    "Yes they do have a.",
    "I forget what it's called.",
    "I think it's a mobile studio.",
    "The Wakeham Mobile studio.",
    "If you get that then it has processor and everything and it's like an all in one thing and you don't need a PC.",
    "But for the model that I have the Centriq 22 and for most of their sentix you do have to have attached to a PC.",
    "It's not going to just run on its own.",
    "The brushes I'm using right now are not the exact ones that are linked below.",
    "The ones that are linked below that was my go to set for about a year and a half.",
    "There's a lot of really good brushes in there, but the ones that I'm using today and that I've been using on stream lately are.",
    "It's a pack of brushes that I'm working on creating.",
    "I've been working on them as fast as I can.",
    "I know it's taking awhile, but I've only been able to work on them here and there, like on the weekends and stuff.",
    "So I'm chipping away at it, but I am going to make this brush pack available for for people to Purchas if you're interested in the future.",
    "I'm just tweaking some last things.",
    "There's a couple more textures I want to include in this brush set that are not yet represented so.",
    "That will come in the future.",
    "But the ones that I'm using right now, there's nowhere to download them yet.",
    "Do you sample the colors from the photograph?",
    "I do not.",
    "You certainly can.",
    "I don't simply because I'm trying to practice.",
    "My ability to like look at a color and figure out what it is.",
    "So I I believe that helps with understanding of color and just overall speed of painting and comfort with getting creative and going off of the reference image with a little bit more of your personal.",
    "Um preferences, but I don't like.",
    "I know some people feel very strongly against color picking one way or the other.",
    "Like it's cheating.",
    "I do not believe that the reason that I'm not doing it is simply for practice, not because I think color picking is evil or something.",
    "Oh, thank you.",
    "It absolutely will letisha when I release this brush pack.",
    "It's going to be I will make appropriate version also.",
    "You can't, yeah yeah I will do that.",
    "I'm creating it 4 photo shop but will do will do appropriate version.",
    "Thanks Ryan.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Uh, with email, been using the Internet since 2014.",
    "So you're gradually changing the colors to blend them in, yes, So what I'm doing is.",
    "If I'm trying to blend colors like let's say I want to blend from a darker green 2 liter green, then I will.",
    "You can do this with absolutely any brush, but what I'll do is you know kind of color pic from the color and then sort of overlap them and just kind of keep doing that because I'm using a brush with transfer so the brush isn't painting at 100%.",
    "It's going a little bit see through so when you overlap the brush with the colour it's going to give you, then sort of a mix of the two and then you can color pick that and put that over there and kind of.",
    "Keep overlapping them.",
    "This only works if your brushes has transfer.",
    "If you're using 100% opacity brush then you're just going to keep doing this and covering each other and that doesn't blend.",
    "But if you use transfer then you're going to be lightly overlapping the colors until you get a blend.",
    "So this is how I blend.",
    "If you want a really, really smooth blend, then you can use even softer brushes than what I'm doing.",
    "You can use a brush that's like a.",
    "An airbrush or something I used to use the airbrush alot for blending before I started getting into these textured looks.",
    "I used to use the airbrush constantly for that.",
    "And as it works really well.",
    "I see is the airbrush to block in to start with a blend and then I would go and paint on top.",
    "In add texture so that works too.",
    "So right now I'm adding a little bit more texture to the top of these Bush is.",
    "Yeah, you're welcome.",
    "No problem.",
    "So I want this feeling of dirt and dust and little tiny pebbles and stuff, so I'm using a brush with a lot of noisy texture.",
    "Where I feel that we're almost done with this one.",
    "There's a few more things that are missing that I want to get in.",
    "One is over on the right.",
    "Things are a bit messy and I want to paint in.",
    "The that there's a plant that I want to paint in.",
    "All these kinds of crazy leaves.",
    "So I want to get a new color green.",
    "Yeah, something bright like this, maybe not quite that bright.",
    "And.",
    "Paint some of these.",
    "I don't know what you would call this kind of plant.",
    "But Amazing how Flowers can bring so much life in a painting.",
    "It's true as sometimes I like to add little wild Flowers to scenes that don't originally have them.",
    "Who's to say where little Flowers can be?",
    "You can just add them where you want and it adds a little bit extra cheerfulness.",
    "Alright, I'm going to take a look at Reds link.",
    "Ended up drawing another one from yesterday.",
    "Stream, let's see.",
    "All Cute.",
    "This is a little sketch pen sketch from red Fox in the chat.",
    "Nicely done.",
    "I want to paint this one, maybe will do it in the upcoming.",
    "In an upcoming stream, maybe will do that one.",
    "Thank you, thank you for sharing.",
    "So I need to add some explanation for why these Flowers are just randomly up here.",
    "So let's.",
    "Let's work on having this little plant pop up behind the other one.",
    "With some leaves.",
    "Adding a couple more little cute little plants different.",
    "After a lot of years feel they need to get a screen tablet.",
    "Thank you for Chiming in, you guys.",
    "Yeah, if you have any.",
    "If you have any particular.",
    "Experience with a different tablets and you want to share that for people that can be really helpful.",
    "Because everyone is different and it helps to hear from.",
    "Hear from people that have tried the different ones, 'cause I've only tried.",
    "I know I haven't tried every kind of tablet out there.",
    "So maybe you guys can notice from looking at my painting, but I tend to start with midtones.",
    "I don't necessarily jump into really, really bright colors right off the bat.",
    "I guess this this white here is fairly bright.",
    "But I usually kind of start with Midtones and then we get to shadows and highlights and things get more contrast that as we go, but they're pretty.",
    "Pretty tame at the beginning.",
    "I'm also trying to get rid of this underpainting as soon as possible.",
    "I do want it to show through in little places like it is showing through, but I don't want big big blobs of orange 'cause that makes it hard to understand what's going on, so I'm going to block in the plants and get that stuff in soon.",
    "And so each stare at each step on these stairs that's facing towards us is going to be darker.",
    "The ones facing up towards the sun will be nice and bright, so.",
    "Something like that.",
    "Over here in the garden, things get a little bit darker.",
    "There's some shadows.",
    "That's going to be a tricky one, so I like to paint when it comes to foliage.",
    "I like to paint dark to light, so I feel like I like how it looks and I feel like you can.",
    "Kind of get through it a little bit more easily that way.",
    "Uh, my question about the computer was Do you need a very performing computer to run Photoshop and this antique?",
    "Oh, I see uhm.",
    "Photo shop.",
    "So I can link you to a page of the.",
    "I think I think this is.",
    "On the Adobe website photo shop system requirements, I'll link you to this because.",
    "Um, what I my, my PC.",
    "I've kind of upgraded beyond what's?",
    "The minimum requirement for using photo shop, for example because I have to stream also and that takes extra processing power.",
    "I'm not 100% sure on like what exactly would be the minimum requirements for example, but Adobe has that information, so I'm going to link you their website in the chat where it talks about that.",
    "I don't know that using a centriq means that you have to have more processing.",
    "I think it's more about running the program anytime you have more processing power or better graphics card, that's going to create.",
    "Less and less lag for you when you're painting, so yeah, I hope you hope that website will help you.",
    "I don't have the the knowledge to go into that in anymore detail.",
    "I think yeah, the better computer you have, the faster and easier things will be to use.",
    "That's true always.",
    "I cash as I have a question.",
    "I recently started digital painting and I keep hearing that you need to sharpen the tip of the Stylus.",
    "Uh, well it depends on what.",
    "Kind of Stylus are if you're using a welcome you don't.",
    "You don't need to sharpen anything, you have to change the nib.",
    "So here if you see there's like it might be too small to see, but there's a tiny little nibs sticking out right at the top of the pen and you have to pull that out and put in a new one every so often.",
    "But depending on the person you go through them at a different rate.",
    "Like for me, it takes a really long time to go through and if, like maybe a year or more, I can't even remember the last time I changed one.",
    "But I don't.",
    "I have my settings set so that I don't have to press very, very hard to get to full opacity with my brush.",
    "I do that for my wrist health so that I don't have to press really hard and hurt my hand.",
    "'cause artists end up with these kind of problems.",
    "Um?",
    "Hi are a welcome.",
    "Do you ever paint on the iPad every once in awhile?",
    "I do.",
    "I got an iPad for Christmas which was very very generous gift and I have played around with it here and there but mainly what I was excited to use it for was kind of like when I'm out and about which with everything going on in the world right now hasn't really been the case.",
    "And when I'm home I prefer to use the.",
    "I prefer to use my Santee can photo shop and my most comfortable setup.",
    "Circular kind of bushy shapes, and then you gotta plant.",
    "You can just make a little.",
    "Little sphere.",
    "At a later green on the top and you gotta push.",
    "Little sphere, little Dome.",
    "Add some later color on the top.",
    "We got a cute little Bush.",
    "I'm going to try again at that plant.",
    "I was trying to paint earlier.",
    "Wasn't really working.",
    "Let's try one more time, so we want these.",
    "He's kind of arched shapes.",
    "And they have light hitting, so some of them are brighter than others.",
    "Some of them come out higher up.",
    "And I think that gives a nice look to the garden overall, just a variety of types of plants.",
    "That's pretty cute.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Right, so we've got some overlap, so I'm bringing some darker green.",
    "And we'll go back with a lighter one more time.",
    "So depending on how detailed you want to get, we could go in and.",
    "Do more with those, but I think that's going to be fine.",
    "Maybe I'll put a little bit of shadow underneath.",
    "We could also put a little highlight on on some of the leaves.",
    "So leaves can be really shiny, so if you want to pick the area that's curved and add a little highlight that will make the leaf look shiny.",
    "Thanks, Red is strange now that I'm more afraid to do digital scenes than traditional.",
    "I wonder why, but it's so cool you're getting that comfortable with traditional.",
    "But I wonder why?",
    "Hey, just remember you can always make a new layer.",
    "It's not too scary.",
    "You can always change things.",
    "So one thing that I haven't really done yet in this scene is a mess with any.",
    "Layer blending modes or anything.",
    "But I still like to use those tools even when I'm going for a traditional look.",
    "I just usually most of the time I end up using them kind of around a bit the end as like a way to tweak things.",
    "Thank you, thank you Mail.",
    "Oh, I just remembered this one more plant that I've kind of excluded over here.",
    "We don't want to do that.",
    "Let's paint this little guy in.",
    "Little leaves here and there and then we've got more of an orangey kind of flower.",
    "I mean, I could definitely go overboard with these and just start adding like tons of Flowers of every color and different plants.",
    "You can really just go over the top, but.",
    "Try not to go too crazy.",
    "OK.",
    "So I'm going to merge everything down.",
    "If we're going to talk finishing touches and things.",
    "Loving the weighted pink Flowers and the bottom left thank you.",
    "Nice contrast you.",
    "Raffi, good to see you, thanks.",
    "So.",
    "Yeah, I don't know.",
    "Maybe when it's more possible to travel and stuff like that.",
    "I'll be using the iPad more.",
    "Let's see when painting.",
    "Do sometimes choose colors not on the image to have a better color harmony on the final painting.",
    "Yes, that's a good question.",
    "I do.",
    "I just do I just kind of go based on feel an instinct and breath, personal preference.",
    "Sometimes I'll change something up that I think will look better, but it's not really based on anything.",
    "Maybe it it might be based on some color theory knowledge that I have, but I'm not really asking myself necessarily just to be honest with you, I don't really.",
    "I think to myself I should add a complementary color here, but it's more like I'm just looking at it and making decisions based on what I feel like it needs.",
    "Like ha.",
    "This might work and I try things like that.",
    "I have my nips for two or three years.",
    "I also know some people to change every two months.",
    "Yeah, that's pretty wild.",
    "I don't know how that happens.",
    "Been using the same names for about six months, is still going strong.",
    "Yeah, you'll know when it's time to change it so the couple times that I have had to change my nib, what happens is suddenly it feels very scratchy like you'll make a brush stroke and it'll feel like you're scratching your tablet, which shouldn't actually scratch it, but it's just a bad feeling the way it feels like it's scraping or something, and then you'll notice that, oh, it's like flattened or something is weird with it and then you can change it.",
    "You'll usually know by feel if it's time to change it, but yeah, mine is going strong for a long time now.",
    "All right, trying to get all these greens in now my painting so far is a bit more muted than the reference, so it'll probably get a little brighter as we go.",
    "But I kind of like the feeling we're getting here, so maybe we'll keep going with that.",
    "I'm going to switch to brush.",
    "That will give me a little bit more.",
    "Ability to do some of these smaller details.",
    "Do usually paint the shadow of the objects, bushes etc before the object.",
    "Uh, it depends.",
    "Sometimes I know this is kind of annoying answer, but the truth is that it will depend on the scene.",
    "Sometimes you just look at the individual scene and sometimes it strikes me that it will be easier to do it one way or the other way so there isn't an answer for every single time that I'm going to do something in a certain order every single time.",
    "Mostly I like to go dark to light, so usually I think I like to sort of block in the object that I'm going to be painting and then add the shadow underneath.",
    "Most of the time, but it's possible it could go in another order.",
    "Archer on that's a lot.",
    "That's a lot of Noobs, and they're not super cheap either.",
    "Do you have any suggestions on how to best learn to use brushes to their full extent?",
    "The extent of options can be a bit overwhelming, So what I would say is one thing that's really helpful in understanding brushes is just playing with this palette.",
    "This is if you go up here when your brushes selected you, bring up the brush settings palette and you can just.",
    "I would say go through these things and just like change them and see what happens.",
    "Just pick any brush that you have and maybe not our round brush because some of the options won't be really obvious.",
    "As obvious what's happening with a round brush, you need something that has like a sort of.",
    "More unusual shape, but pick up brush.",
    "Go through the settings and just see what they do.",
    "Because for me a lot of what I've learned about brushes has been through trial and error, just messing around with them in the settings and seeing if I can.",
    "Discover something because.",
    "Before I got into making my own brushes, I kind of the kind of gateway to that was like personalizing brushes from other brush sets, like just taking brushes that already exists, an trying to tweak them to better suit a situation, so that might be a first.",
    "Like the first thing to try is like messing with a brush settings on brushes you already have, but just remember, like, well, as much as I love.",
    "I love using brushes on like a big I love to experiment with textures and brushes, but.",
    "Don't feel like if you don't feel ready with it if it doesn't feel like it feels like it's confusing and not helping you, you can always just stick to the basic brushes.",
    "Brushes aren't the most important thing.",
    "They're kind of like texture to me is sort of an icing on the cake.",
    "The most important thing is going to be your composition, your color, knowledge, or.",
    "Hum.",
    "Trying to see if there's anything else I should add in.",
    "I mean we could, like I said it's we could go on.",
    "We could go on with these plants but.",
    "For finishing things, what I usually do is go to my.",
    "Adjustment layers so that I'll be over here.",
    "On my layers palette oh have to start this again after I restarted.",
    "Whoops, there we go.",
    "Ah, OK, so.",
    "The.",
    "Adjustment layers you can go to little half circle icon and.",
    "Let's try.",
    "Let's try the levels.",
    "So this will be good for messing with values.",
    "We can see if we want the darker shadows to be darker.",
    "If we want the midtones to be lighter or darker, you can mess with all kinds of things can really change the mood of your painting.",
    "Do you want the?",
    "The lights to be brighter, so usually I'll come in here and a lot of times I end up adding a little bit of extra.",
    "Contrast.",
    "Sometimes will lower the Opacity gets a little too much.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Prefer digital, so I don't know what I'm feeling.",
    "This kind of like mistakes in traditional.",
    "Just don't look so off to me.",
    "Yeah, yeah, I know I know what you mean I've been.",
    "I've been going for like as you know, I've been going for more of this traditional looking my digital.",
    "Maybe it's something to do with that I don't know.",
    "I don't know.",
    "Now the other filters that I like to use or the other adjustment layers would be color balance.",
    "I like to go through these sliders from Shadows, Midtones and highlights, and sometimes I change nothing, but other times I do so you can see the mood, the difference in mood.",
    "If you want to go with more red or magenta and the shadows, you can make it feel like it's more in midday, or you can make it feel like it's almost sunset if you go with a really warm glow, there's so much you can do and really change or.",
    "Exaggerate the mood in your painting.",
    "Whatever you were going for, so.",
    "I like to go through this sometimes if I feel like I'm stuck even halfway through a painting.",
    "If I feel like I'm not getting the results I want, sometimes I'll come in here and mess with one of these adjustment layers and make some adjustments there and then continue with my painting.",
    "So sometimes it will help break me away from a from being stuck if I'm stuck.",
    "But let's let's take a look.",
    "What that looks like before an after, so I didn't really change a ton.",
    "It's a little bit warmer maybe.",
    "Do you have a favorite type of flower?",
    "Oh, that stuff.",
    "As tough.",
    "Yeah, my favorite type of flower dip paint is kind of the ones that we painted in this image.",
    "'cause I just feel like there so fun and easy to just paint little dabs with your brush like dot dot dot and it looks like Flowers so I like painting Flowers from that perfect distance where you can just put a little paint stroke and it looks like a flower that's so like fun and easy to paint.",
    "These cheerful little Flowers so I like that, but my favorite type of flower might be a big fan of lavender.",
    "I have lavender in my garden.",
    "It's not.",
    "Really time for it quite yet, but I love how it looks at how it smells and all the bees and butterflies that come.",
    "So lavender is probably my favorite.",
    "I had to choose one.",
    "So I also like selective color.",
    "Selective color is kind of similar to the color balance, only it's even more powerful.",
    "You can select the individual colors here and then within that color range you can decide to you know, for example, within the Reds in the scene, I can go more or less cyan within those red, so you can really boost up your colors, change the moods, same kind of thing is I was saying before but you can edit your painting quite a lot through these through the selective color you can really change things without going in and repainting.",
    "Stuff is really powerful so.",
    "This can help a lot in getting the right colors in the right mood.",
    "If you feel like you're not having good luck picking your colors right off the bat and having them be exactly what you're imagining, you can try selective color to modify what you've got.",
    "And yeah, I really like it.",
    "So I don't always go through all these sliders, but sometimes I will.",
    "Sometimes I'll just go through all the colors and see if I can see if I find any, discover anything cool, and then I always look at the before and after.",
    "Make sure I like it, 'cause sometimes sometimes I end up liking the original better and sometimes I'll turn the painting to black and white and do like a value comparison and make sure I'm not doing anything to funky.",
    "Value Wise, but if we do the before and after this is before this is after 4 after so it is a bit brighter.",
    "Your values, like the darks and lights in your image and then the textures are going to be like an ice icing on the cake kind of thing so don't feel like you have to force yourself into getting into all this fancy stuff with brushes if it's not really not really vibing with it, it'll come.",
    "You don't have to force it.",
    "Oh cool, thank you.",
    "Thank you.",
    "I cashed it sounds good.",
    "All right, so we're going around the windows.",
    "I'm going to take a peek at what time it is I know we had a little tech thing.",
    "I do restart the stream so we might end up taking a little bit longer on this one because of that.",
    "Hopefully will be able to stay on track.",
    "What size of the image on your centriq that you work on, so I think.",
    "My resolution is 1920 by 1200 if I'm remembering correctly, but you can make your canvas size whatever you like.",
    "You know that's not related to the tablet.",
    "So I can just go to image, image size, my current image size is 5000 by 4000 pixels.",
    "I made it really pretty big because I want to be able to do like multiple paintings on one screen.",
    "I'll tend sorry if this is a silly question, but how do you get the photograph reference pic does it on top?",
    "Oh, it's not silly.",
    "You can find a link to pure ref.",
    "That's a program I'm using for that.",
    "It's below the stream in the info description.",
    "Yeah, blow this agreement and stream in the description.",
    "You can find the info thing.",
    "Thanks Natalie I'm trying.",
    "I'm trying.",
    "I know sometimes I might miss stuff if I ever miss a question in the chat if it scrolled up before I got a chance to see it.",
    "Don't be embarrassed to repost it or something.",
    "It's not.",
    "It's not on purpose, but thank you.",
    "I'm trying to keep up with it.",
    "Thank you is Mayo.",
    "Pure ref yeah yeah, if you're F is really handy you can use it for a bunch of stuff, organizing reference images and things.",
    "The main thing that I use it for is just what you're seeing here just to.",
    "Show a little thumbnail above above photo shop and it's I think it's nice during stream 'cause everyone can see at least what I'm trying to work on.",
    "But if you want to see the reference larger, you can find it the link to the reference is also down there in the.",
    "In the description.",
    "Alright, let's get some color on these roofs back here.",
    "I think we can.",
    "This is a background so I think we can get away with just basically a flat color on the roof and that's going to be enough I hope.",
    "And.",
    "Block him and distant foliage.",
    "Think a nice warm green with a lot of yellow.",
    "Make it feel like the sun is shining bright on there.",
    "Yeah, no worries.",
    "My darken the shadows a bit.",
    "I see your sampling lot of colors from the drawing while you paint.",
    "Is that for color variation or more smooth transitions from light to dark more the second one?",
    "Like you're saying, yeah, I do color pic from my own painting a lot, and usually what I'm doing is blending when I'm color picking an or just.",
    "You know, it's easy.",
    "Maybe I want to use that color again.",
    "But for example, I'll show over here like I'll take the color like this.",
    "And then they'll be a color next to it, and so I'll color pic here and then make a stroke Olympic here make a stroke.",
    "And kind of going back and forth.",
    "And then that's how I kind of create like a blend.",
    "So alt alter the color picker paint stroke all to paint stroke.",
    "So I'm clicking a lot.",
    "I'm sure you can hear it.",
    "The keyboard clicks, but that's how I'm doing a lot of the blending like that.",
    "And even though it's handy, I do have gotten the.",
    "I have heard from other artists and suggested in tutorials and things, something I'm trying to pay attention to is the fact that color picking from your own painting.",
    "Well, it can give you like a cohesiveness.",
    "Overall, it can also kind of make your colors a little bit more dull, so I'm trying to remember not just a color pic from my own painting, but also to go back to the to the color wheel and add more variations of colors to even when I'm trying to create blends in between colors, adding another Hue in the mix is nice.",
    "OK, so let's do something with these windows.",
    "Maybe we can make them mostly dark and then add the details.",
    "We will make the windows little bigger.",
    "One thing that you can do is go and Mascouten area.",
    "So I do like the extra bright NIS but I would like the bottom of the canvas to be darker.",
    "So what I'll do is choose a black, go to the mask, click on the mask and paint with black so that will get rid of the adjustment in that area.",
    "So you can bring it back in if you want by painting it in with white.",
    "So this is a nice way to edit your painting in a non destructive manner, because these are you can go back and change these and take them away and it doesn't modify original painting, but I don't care about that right now so I'm going to merge them all down.",
    "Yeah, I am actually a huge fan of the Witcher.",
    "I played the.",
    "Games two and three and recently like over the Holidays I replayed the Witcher 3.",
    "I kind of wish I did it now 'cause this would be a good time to replay it, but.",
    "Yeah, I absolutely love.",
    "I've painted a couple screenshots from the game.",
    "For this type of study, maybe will do, maybe will be more of that.",
    "OK, let's move this back over here.",
    "So the last thing I'll do is some sort of like manual adjustments and things.",
    "So for example.",
    "Make a new layer, put it on multiply.",
    "And choose let's just choose like a medium Gray.",
    "And that and then come through and decide where we might want things to be a little bit darker and just add that extra little bit of shadow work on the values.",
    "Little bit maybe in the background.",
    "These these shadow should a bit darker.",
    "And then I'll make a new layer and kind of the opposite.",
    "Put the layer on color Dodge.",
    "I like to double click the layer an uncheck the transparency shapes layer.",
    "That will make the color Dodge behave just a little bit differently, and I kind of prefer it's a little bit more saturation.",
    "And it will lower the Opacity and just take a big airbrush and find some places where you imagine the light is hitting most strongly and just do a little lick dab of the airbrush there.",
    "And.",
    "So before or after, if you feel like things are getting too over exposed, you can just lower the opacity a little bit.",
    "I'm going to go back to the shadow layer and.",
    "I have a little bit more shadow to this building.",
    "Thoughts on the Witcher?",
    "Netflix show?",
    "I enjoyed it.",
    "I enjoyed it.",
    "I was happy to have some more Witcher content in my life.",
    "I thought that Henry Cavill was amazing.",
    "Um?",
    "To me it was a.",
    "It was a bit.",
    "It was different than the games and I know that that's yeah they were basing the show off of the books, so there were going to be some differences in interpretations.",
    "Overall, I really enjoyed it.",
    "I didn't love everything.",
    "There were some of the some of the things I just.",
    "I was so used to the games that I kind of craved for certain things to be more similar.",
    "Like certain characters looking different.",
    "This and that it was just kind of like it took some getting used to for me.",
    "Overall I liked it.",
    "And so I have a lot of friends that are like really obsessed with it.",
    "I'm not quite on that level, but I was happy.",
    "Like I said, I was just happy to have some more with your content and it was really well done.",
    "Overall.",
    "So I'll be looking for looking forward to more.",
    "Alright, well I could probably like Tweek this for awhile, but I think I'm going to call it done with those final adjustments.",
    "For merge things down in Metairie, so a little bit more of this shadow if you want to too much.",
    "But Yeah, Alright will merge that down.",
    "So that was our first one.",
    "I can zoom in so we can take a closer look.",
    "So you see that the perspective is a little bit different than the reference.",
    "Not all the details are there, but I focus on the things I like the Flowers, the nice lighting.",
    "We left out some of the like.",
    "There's some lights and wires and things that we left out, some little rocks and things.",
    "If I was going to spend more time on this, I'd probably work on the doors and window.",
    "There bit loose and then the area down here could use some work, but I think it's fine for the amount of time we're doing here.",
    "The book story and game story isn't the same story at all.",
    "Yeah, I'm I have read a little bit of I read like half of the last wish and then I was actually going.",
    "I was moving at the time so I kind of ran out of time to read it and I never picked it back up again, but.",
    "So we've got a little bit of A.",
    "Scion little bit more towards a blue green color there.",
    "One thing that's been a little bit hard for me with trying out this kind of style is being left being OK with things being less.",
    "Clean like letting things not match up perfectly, but just remembering that when you zoom out and taking the whole scene it can still work.",
    "So we've got little lace curtain in there.",
    "Very cute.",
    "I just want to hint at that and then hopefully when we zoom out it makes sense.",
    "I don't know if it does, but that's what I'm trying.",
    "And.",
    "Let's dark in the.",
    "The area around the window.",
    "Windows still coming out.",
    "Towards us, and maybe that's where I'll use a pure white I.",
    "I know some people are against using like pure white.",
    "I will ever once in awhile use pure white if there's a situation like this.",
    "Those window sills are like the brightest thing in the scene, so I think.",
    "Going really, really bright there is fine.",
    "A little bit of a darker off white.",
    "Still pretty bright, but not quite pure white.",
    "For the shadows.",
    "And then maybe you can bring that way a little bit up so you can kind of see where the shadow begins.",
    "OK.",
    "So there's also shadows of wires, and things will have to put the wires in, so these shadows makes sense.",
    "But for example.",
    "Can have little shadows coming down the side of the house here.",
    "So let's see what it looks like if I turn the.",
    "The sketch back up.",
    "Yeah, so I personally like it better without the sketch.",
    "Some people will work the sketches in or use them in their painting.",
    "It kind of depends on the style you're going for, but I try to keep my sketch opacity pretty low so that it tells me where to paint, but the I could eventually get rid of it.",
    "I want to fill in more of his garden over here.",
    "Go let things be pretty abstract, at least at the base layer.",
    "Little dirt in little grasses and things.",
    "And then we'll try to bring something out of there that makes sense.",
    "More shadow.",
    "So basically all these buildings as we get closer to the ground, there's going to be more shadow from the plants and other things.",
    "So I want this.",
    "It looks like a rose Bush or something is really pretty plant and I want the leaves to be more.",
    "I want to stand out from the other plants.",
    "I want the leaves to be more blue green like less yellow.",
    "So do something like this.",
    "Maybe even a darker blue green to make it through.",
    "Give some dimension.",
    "Pick a little highlight color for with the sun setting.",
    "So I've been going over here and selecting the colors, but you can also turn on.",
    "Yeah, you can use color dynamics.",
    "Uncheck apply per tip and then depending on your settings, let's put this a little bit higher every time you make a brush stroke, it will slightly alter the color.",
    "You won't be able to control exactly like whatever it goes.",
    "Lighter or darker would be a little bit of a surprise, but it can be nice when you're painting plants and things and you want a little bit of randomness.",
    "Yeah, I could tell even from a little bit there there was a bit different, but yeah, that's what happens.",
    "My original introduction to this.",
    "The story was through the games, so even if it's not the 100% accurate, it still like this story that I have most of my heart, you know.",
    "Which character from the game do you prefer?",
    "And.",
    "Well, Geralt's, my favorite, but I was always on Team Triss.",
    "I have to admit the 3rd so I start.",
    "I played the second one first so I was kind of had a soft spot for Triss because she was more like the Main.",
    "Lady in that game and then yeah in the Witcher 3 I also got a little bit more.",
    "I like Jen too.",
    "I'm not like Anti one of them but I don't know.",
    "I kind of trees is kind of my favorite because of that.",
    "Yeah.",
    "OK guys, let's go on to the next one shall we?",
    "If anybody was painting along or sketching along and you want to share what you did, you're welcome too.",
    "If you need more time, that's cool, but whenever you want, you can post a link in the chat to your artwork.",
    "If you did a sketch of this, the next one we're going to do is right here.",
    "This is the reference, so it's going to be all natural one.",
    "No buildings, we can relax, play with colors.",
    "I think it's really cool.",
    "This effect is like blue effect.",
    "I know it's maybe a little bit overdone, but in this photo, but I don't care.",
    "I love it.",
    "Love it.",
    "OK so I'm going to share this reference above.",
    "The chat and info tab let me add it there.",
    "If you want the exact crop that I'm going to be using, if you want a 360 view that's already in the description below, stream, it's the second one, second link.",
    "All right, so we've got our little mini.",
    "View appear like that little smaller.",
    "And I will put this on the other monitor.",
    "Hey fish in good to see you, thank you thank you.",
    "Looks beautiful, Mattie might take alright.",
    "Let me check it out Jackson and thank you.",
    "All right?",
    "Your perspective is always like, so right on, this really feels like the more correct angle to the reference, then why I ended up with really solid Jackson.",
    "That's beautiful.",
    "Yeah guys, check this out.",
    "I also I like your composition more of a square.",
    "I'm definitely fat square composition.",
    "I think I'm going to go for that with the next one that we're doing.",
    "Yeah, I really really nice.",
    "Love the colors in these Flowers and some of those lost edges.",
    "We've got some crispness and some sort of blurred effect to those that's really satisfying.",
    "Yeah, this works well as like a focal point for me.",
    "Very pretty.",
    "Thank you for painting with me, Jackson and if anybody else wants to, you can grab the reference and paint along.",
    "So I'm moving over here.",
    "We're going to work on a little bit more of a square composition.",
    "The reference is a bit more elongated than what I have here, but I think I'm just going to work with this.",
    "And again, I'm going to try to do this in around an hour.",
    "We had some tech issues, so I feel like I'm a little bit behind on my schedule, but we're going to try to catch up here on this one, 'cause I think this one will have a little bit of a chance to do that because it's there's no buildings and crazy stuff.",
    "So fingers crossed, but let's start with the start with the sketch.",
    "Hi Sean.",
    "Thank you fish and I'm doing good.",
    "I'm doing good.",
    "About to paint.",
    "Some of my favorite settings for me.",
    "This kind of thing.",
    "A little pathway through the forest.",
    "This is like some of my favorite type of scene to paint.",
    "In the world, so I'm happy.",
    "So I like the feeling of it going away into the distance, so I want to make sure we have a pathway that begins very small and narrow and gets bigger coming towards us.",
    "And.",
    "Something like this?",
    "And then we've got next to that little bit of dirt.",
    "And then next to that and got all the plants.",
    "All the plants got a little bit of a higher ro of Bush is or trees here.",
    "Same thing on the other side.",
    "Oh no, you don't like painting leaves.",
    "Read says what makes me laugh is the community started by blaming the cast of Henry Cavill to play girl, then ended up putting him in God Stand 'cause he's good.",
    "You want those.",
    "Potential for happy accidents.",
    "You want to be a little surprised?",
    "Just let the color dynamics do whatever it wants.",
    "To come up with some ideas.",
    "Alright, so yeah that well that that Bush is definitely looking different than the rest.",
    "I kind of want to bring that same.",
    "I think it's the same type of plant over here, so we'll use the same kind of effect.",
    "Speaking about styles do have a painting style like something we can say that's mateys.",
    "Oh, I don't know.",
    "I don't know.",
    "I think for a lot of artists, including myself, I think it's it can be harder for us to identify our own style.",
    "I think a lot of times other people can have an easier time identifying identifying our style.",
    "Also, I think I'm going through a little bit of a style change.",
    "I've been experimenting with textures over the past few months, and that's something that wasn't a big thing for me before that so.",
    "It's hard to say something that somebody might think of as my style that might have changed that might be in the process of changing.",
    "'cause I'm trying new things.",
    "Finding new things that I like that I didn't even know about or care about before.",
    "So I think style is definitely evolving overtime.",
    "And it's potentially a lifelong journey, like you certainly will have a style.",
    "Everyone has a style based on the decisions you make when you're painting it.",
    "Just it just happens.",
    "You know you're making those decisions.",
    "Each brush stroke that you make, even if you're even if you're studying another artist, you're trying to learn from them and you're trying to emulate them, you're still going to have your own preferences sneaking through there.",
    "That's just how it works, so.",
    "Uhm, I love.",
    "Painting scenes with a lot of plants, a lot of nature.",
    "I know this is more of a subject matter thing than style, but I love bright sunlight, dappled light, those kinds of things, those kinds of settings could be maybe something that people.",
    "Might recognize as being something that I do a lot of.",
    "So for me, what I'm doing to find that right now Mail is like I'm experimenting with textures.",
    "I'm experimenting with, you know I'll, I'll find another artist that I really like and I'll do a master study of their work to try to learn from them.",
    "Recently I did a master study of James Reynolds.",
    "It's one of my favorite artists, landscape painters.",
    "So I tried to recreate one of his artworks so I do feel like I learned a lot in trying to emulate his style.",
    "So I think style studies it comes a little bit from doing master studies.",
    "It comes from doing photo studies and experimenting.",
    "Definitely doing things differently than what you've done before is a way to help figure out style because.",
    "If you're trying to evolve something, then you have to be willing to attempt changing it and then see what you like and don't like about that.",
    "This is Mattie Bowers Behets.",
    "It's a good time, good time so far.",
    "Yeah, I'm happy with.",
    "I'm happy with the fact that my my style and tastes are progressing because I'm having more fun with my art genuinely.",
    "Genuinely.",
    "I think it's important to look at what you get in tune with what you like.",
    "It seems obvious, but what kind of artworks are you attracted to when you see someone else is work?",
    "I know what is it that you see in your like Oh my gosh, I love that I want to be able to do that.",
    "You know, if you feel that way, then I think that's a good opportunity to.",
    "To try to study what it is that you saw that made you feel that way, try try to do a study of it.",
    "See what you can learn from it.",
    "See what little things like you can incorporate into your style from that.",
    "It doesn't mean you have to.",
    "Um?",
    "Yeah, I don't think that.",
    "It's like you're not trying to copy everything about another artist or or become them, but it's just seeing something you like and saying.",
    "How can I learn from that?",
    "And maybe incorporating a little bit of that into what I do and doing that whenever you see those kinds of things overtime it ends up.",
    "All those influences come together to form what you are and what you create an.",
    "So it's an evolution.",
    "Let's put these windows in the door.",
    "Yeah, I guess people didn't think he could pull it off but he really did.",
    "He really did.",
    "He deserves all the praise.",
    "Haha right fish.",
    "Oh man yeah, it's good to see you guys.",
    "Thanks for being here.",
    "All right, so we're going to keep these these plants pretty soft and fluffy.",
    "And then we're going to have some stand out against the massive green and they have their own little more unique identities, so that's going to be this tree right here.",
    "The little arm reaching out like that.",
    "I've got some random ones.",
    "This tree over here actually let's do this one first, 'cause this one is in the foreground.",
    "Kind of overlaps the other.",
    "So like this, maybe we can even go out more of an extreme angle, so I'm going to select what I drew, go to edit, transform, skew so this will let me just tilt it like that.",
    "Super handy.",
    "Don't have to repaint anything.",
    "And.",
    "I used the transform tools a lot in my sketching.",
    "I'd like to sketch a perfect the first time, but it's not always the case.",
    "Got the other tree here matching up alright.",
    "And then on this side, we've got some unique plants too, so we've got one palm tree that comes up over here.",
    "Yeah, Yeah Ryan, he's someone that would be good to do.",
    "A portrait study of he's got very like strong facial features.",
    "That would be a good choice.",
    "All right, so we've got our palm tree with a sketch in roughly the area of the palm fronds will take up, so something like this.",
    "And then some other over here, so I'm just sketching in like the outline of where I want to paint these plants within.",
    "I'm not necessarily going to sketch the plants when we paid, the plants were going to make them look.",
    "More like the plant with leaves and stuff, but I'm just trying to get a feel for where their placements going to be.",
    "Over here we've got some branches kind of coming in from the side more close up to us, so we've got these big leaves that's going to be nice.",
    "Yeah, OK, so I tried to fit this in.",
    "The reference has a little bit of different of a composition than what I've done here, so I'm trying to like.",
    "Make that work.",
    "I think it's.",
    "I think it's good.",
    "So will merge everything together.",
    "Bring that pulled over like this.",
    "Think we're ready to go so there's one thing that I forgot that I did last time.",
    "It worked pretty well so I had merged this painting on the left over onto the background layer what I'm going to do is go to layer new layer via copy and put that on its own layer and just lock that layer so no matter what I'm not going to accidentally destroy this painting on the left so we can preserve it.",
    "Just to be safe.",
    "Hi, our age welcome and thank you.",
    "If you guys have any questions let me know.",
    "We're going to begin the new one right now.",
    "So see where is the best place to put this?",
    "Trying to show as much of my paintings possible?",
    "Alright new layer and what should we choose is an underpainting for this one.",
    "I wonder if we should go for a similar color, so I'm looking on the ground that warm colour maybe will go with something a little bit more pink.",
    "I've been trying to experiment with different underpainting colors, but I find that in a sunny environment I tend to use kind of the same thing over and over again, but seems to work for me.",
    "But let's go a little bit more pink.",
    "See if we could get more of a tropical feeling in this.",
    "So this is just so that we can start off with.",
    "We don't want a white background, we want something that's a little bit more midrange value wise, so something that's not too too dark or too light.",
    "And like we could go a little bit darker if we want to actually think through.",
    "What the value structure of the scene is going to look like?",
    "It's going to be something like this.",
    "All thank you foster.",
    "Welcome back, sorry about the tech things.",
    "I'm glad you like the results.",
    "Highclere welcome.",
    "Welcome welcome alright.",
    "So we've got our underpainting.",
    "Let's try to keep this one extra loose for the sake of.",
    "For the sake of time, and you know, playing with style, so will try to keep it loose.",
    "I'm going to take the sketch layer, put it on multiply mode, and lower the opacity.",
    "That will make it easier to see through, and I'm going to lock the layer at around 20% opacity somewhere around there, and then we're going to paint underneath that layer and just use it as a guide.",
    "Fished in by the way, I've noticed you sketch some paintings, some not.",
    "Is that just because of what you feel like doing or do you sketch the harder ones?",
    "Yes, good question.",
    "I absolutely do that.",
    "Lock it down right?",
    "Ryan lives will have any accidents already we had did that once today.",
    "Oh cool, thank you for letting me know Claire Claire Z.",
    "You can you can go into your settings and change that here if you would prefer to.",
    "It's it's up to you.",
    "Yeah, efficient.",
    "I usually what I do is I.",
    "It depends on how comfortable I feel with the situation with the like.",
    "If there's if there's buildings.",
    "If I feel like the scene is complicated, all those kinds of things will encourage me to do a sketch first, but sometimes I'm feeling confident or I think that the scene would be a cool one to try just going in with shapes, so I'll do that.",
    "But a lot of times I most of the time I think I sketch.",
    "Ahead of time sometimes, I guess I'm feeling confident and I'll try not doing it.",
    "All thank you clever.",
    "Thank you for looking and listening in.",
    "I hope your work is going well.",
    "I'm trying to figure out what to do.",
    "First, you guys and I feel a little bit.",
    "It's a little bit overwhelming trying to decide that.",
    "Um?",
    "I'm imagining that going dark to light would be good.",
    "So usually I like to do the background first so you know what.",
    "Let's just stick to my normal workflow whenever I get confused, I just say you know what?",
    "Let's go back to back to basics.",
    "Let's go back to the normal thing.",
    "Don't get confused that this little bit of a different composition here, so I was thinking, oh maybe we'll start here there.",
    "Now, let's start with the Sky.",
    "Let's start with the Sky.",
    "Then we'll decide what we want to do.",
    "So I'm going a little bit more of an Aqua Sky, a little bit more teal.",
    "This time.",
    "And then we'll make a layer on top of that.",
    "For, let's begin with the plants.",
    "Oh, there you go?",
    "Yeah clears.",
    "It's updated, at least for me.",
    "I can see.",
    "Fish, and there's also the thing where every once in awhile I just kind of forget and then I start painting and then I'm like Oh yeah, I didn't sketch.",
    "No idea why that happens sometimes.",
    "Pretty weird.",
    "OK?",
    "So yeah, we're going to we're going to do first this medium.",
    "Well, it's pretty bright actually, but.",
    "We're going to do a medium ish green sure RH.",
    "I'm using a Wakeham Centriq 22.",
    "I'll type it in the chat for you.",
    "If that's easier to see it.",
    "It's the it's the 22 not the 22 HD.",
    "Alright, I will get a little bit of a gradient to this, but I want to get a tropical feeling so I'm going to focus on taking inspiration from the colors of the reference, but may be shifting it a little bit more to fit this kind of vibe.",
    "So over on the right, things are more in shadow over.",
    "Also we can shift are Green a little bit darker.",
    "Yeah, you're welcome, alright.",
    "And I'm just trying to block in the basics.",
    "I don't want to get too detailed into anything until there at least everything is blocked in in the scene.",
    "So for example before we start doing anymore foliage, I'm going to work on the ground and add the shadows going across the middle.",
    "Jackson says this kind.",
    "This kind of rough feels overwhelming for me too.",
    "It's like I struggle to understand what's going on at all.",
    "I'm glad to hear that is also wondering why I was like I was so excited to paint this one.",
    "'cause I love this kind of environment and then I'm sitting here like where do I start?",
    "Clearly says I'm so guilty of not sketching.",
    "I kind of dislike the sketching process and just getting stuck in probably very bad habit.",
    "Not necessarily.",
    "It depends on what works well for you, so it's only bad if you feel like.",
    "It's hurting your painting somehow.",
    "I think it's OK to do some sort of a compromise where you sketch a loose plan of things.",
    "Maybe you're not enjoying getting stuck in like a sort of a line art phase where you're like deciding every detail but just a rough sketch can be nice, just a little bit of just to plan out the basic composition and then go for it.",
    "Let's see, Ryan says, do you think you tend to like the outcome of onesie sketch over the ones you don't?",
    "Or can you not see the difference?",
    "I I wonder, actually I'm not sure.",
    "I I wonder if I went back and kind of assess them the results.",
    "I I don't know that there is one I prefer, I think that.",
    "When I don't sketch, it does have a chance to look more painterly, which is often something I'm going for.",
    "What I've noticed OK, so one thing I have noticed is if I don't sketch then the beginning part of the painting.",
    "Can look really, really really rough because sometimes I'll just try to start without any guidelines and things will be.",
    "Things will be not looking great.",
    "You know what I mean?",
    "And it takes awhile to work up to something that looks better.",
    "But oftentimes I do like the results.",
    "It looks more painterly, looks more more traditional ish, kind of.",
    "So you kind of have to.",
    "There's like that.",
    "Balance.",
    "A sketch really gives you something to go off of so that you're not like.",
    "Coming up with wild stuff, you know, like proportions of things for me.",
    "Realize there was a dog in the previous one.",
    "Yeah there was.",
    "I know what kind of cop down and didn't draw the dog.",
    "I really like the effect of the striping of the shadows going across.",
    "We can see the individual trees.",
    "Tree shapes.",
    "So let's get a lighter color for the sidewalk where it's getting hit by light.",
    "Not quite sure what color I want to go with.",
    "So that.",
    "But I want to start blocking in some of this.",
    "This is probably 1 where it's going to be important to look at the painting in black-and-white because there's a lot of tricky value things here.",
    "So for example, I want there to be highlights that come across the dirt, so they're going to be on the dirt and they're going to be on the.",
    "The path and they need to look.",
    "Similar in value when you look in black and white.",
    "But in the painting they need to make sense that the dirt highlights are going to be warmer.",
    "'cause something Brown is being illuminated on the.",
    "The pathway is going to be cooler because something great is being illuminated, but it's still roughly the same amount of brightness.",
    "Is the goal something that might have worked really well for this is to just paint the just paint the thing and it's whatever shadow color, and then add use like color, Dodge or something like that to do the lighting that could have worked.",
    "Let me show another workflow and we'll see.",
    "Maybe I'll even use that instead.",
    "If it turns out really great.",
    "But so for example.",
    "For example, if I.",
    "Hum.",
    "Let's get that flat color for the pathway real quick and will get that in and I'll show you what I mean.",
    "OK, so we've got our pathway.",
    "Make a new layer.",
    "Hi thing welcome more than one dog.",
    "A whole herd.",
    "Yeah, if you turn the camera there's like 5 dogs.",
    "I don't know what's happening but they're having a good time.",
    "Fish and if it was a fish I would have never left it up.",
    "OK, so let's try this so.",
    "So I'm putting this layer on multiply so.",
    "Here is what we get.",
    "Basically, a shadow that goes over and it will darken the purple to a darker purple.",
    "It'll darken the Brown to a darker Brown, so instead of me trying to figure that out, multiply is pretty nice here, so I might use a different brush.",
    "But I think this might be the way to go.",
    "Alright, so let's try it.",
    "And we're going to do the same thing as we're doing right here.",
    "With multiply.",
    "We're going to do this with color Dodge to add highlights.",
    "Yeah, and if you compare it with the other one, yeah, I'm more happy with it.",
    "We are going to brighten things up.",
    "But this is a good start.",
    "And you can even use this on the green to add shadow 2.",
    "So layer blending modes can be super Super Handy.",
    "For this kind of thing.",
    "And we can shift the color a little bit more towards blue or green if you want for continuing up onto the foliage and adding some shadows.",
    "That color will make a little bit more sense there.",
    "Yeah, I will merge that down.",
    "And then make a new layer.",
    "That does make me feel better, yes.",
    "And let's try color Dodge, so make a new layer, put it on call Dodge.",
    "I'll double click the layer and uncheck transparency shapes layer.",
    "And then let's.",
    "Pick a nice bright peachy color and look at that.",
    "That's pretty cool, pretty cool effects.",
    "It's a bit overexposed, but you can always lower the Opacity a little bit, but I think it works so well for this.",
    "So then we're just gonna drop in some.",
    "Some highlights.",
    "And you can go right across.",
    "The pathway you go across the pathway an across the dirt.",
    "And apply the same color everywhere so it is intense.",
    "Maybe right?",
    "Maybe I should turn that back on transparency shapes layer may be a little too intense.",
    "With that on.",
    "But so this is just a first pass at.",
    "This will be able to go back in here and paint without the color.",
    "Dodge just kind of paint normally after this, but I think this is working well to give us a starting point.",
    "Alright, so we still have the layer the sketch on another layer.",
    "Try not to merge that again.",
    "OK, so now I will go back to a brush I was using at the beginning.",
    "Just like a texture textured brush and let's add some blue ish so more blueish bounce light onto the road.",
    "So these areas that are in shadow they're not super super dark and they are reflecting some really pretty blue light.",
    "So now that we have a starting point I'm going to try to paint on top of this and clean up some things.",
    "Get less muddy colors than what I have right now, hopefully that'll work.",
    "But if anybody's painting along with me, I hope.",
    "I hope you're enjoying it.",
    "This one seems a little tricky, but it's I think are really pretty scene, so hopefully hopefully you'll enjoy that.",
    "We can turn the painting into black and white to get a look at it and I would suggest turning the reference into black-and-white too, so this is really helpful to me.",
    "It shows me that I mean look at these shadows and highlights so the shadows and highlights are more important than the difference between the road and the dirt.",
    "Contrast Wise.",
    "As much as I absolutely love dappled light, and I like painting scenes that involve it, I do find it a little tricky.",
    "For the for exactly this kind of reason, the.",
    "The values the.",
    "The values in the colours and everything, they just it's so intense the difference.",
    "Between these highlighted areas on the shadows.",
    "But will get a nice glow.",
    "We just gotta go back and forth until it makes sense.",
    "I think just like with any painting.",
    "If you feel like 1 area really feels wrong, sometimes that has to do not just with that area but with the rest of the painting.",
    "Like there's a lot of I need to get a lot more darker values over in the.",
    "The foliage and that will help make it makes sense why there's this dark area on the ground right now.",
    "What I'm doing feels a little out of place because of that.",
    "So let's let's just merge what we have now so far is like a beginning.",
    "An will go to the Bush is on the side and add some more dark.",
    "Dark colors and hopefully that will help us to visualize.",
    "Overall, visualize the with the shadows should look like better.",
    "So down here.",
    "From this side and we can add in the trees too.",
    "So I've tried to get too stuck on one area.",
    "If you are like something that I have tried to remember as like, make sure the rest of the painting is working too.",
    "'cause that might be part of why that one area is bugging you.",
    "It might have to do with the relationship between that area and other things, so like it really will make more sense when we get these trees in.",
    "Let's pick it dark Brown.",
    "I love the gradient.",
    "In the colour of these trees, so I'm doing them on during the trees on their own layer.",
    "So this is going to be easier to do that way.",
    "So paint the whole shape of the tree first, not worrying about anything to do with shading.",
    "Just do one thing at a time.",
    "So painting the shape of the tree.",
    "Oops, let me choose a texture brush for my eraser will be better.",
    "Alright, feeling in the whole shape and then it will lock the layer.",
    "Press little checkerboard icon here.",
    "And.",
    "Will get a nice purple blue at the top.",
    "'cause look at the reference.",
    "We've got a beautiful glow from the Sky.",
    "Always enjoy it.",
    "When I paint along a bit of suffering.",
    "Well, I'm definitely feeling that right now.",
    "This one is tougher than I thought.",
    "OK, so we're going to put some bright lights hitting the tree also.",
    "So along with that cool balance late, we also have bright splash of this dappled light hitting the tree.",
    "Would be very scared to tackle reference like that.",
    "Yeah, I definitely felt pretty intimidated when I finally got down to it.",
    "I think I felt the scene was so pretty that I was not paying attention to anything else besides that this is beautiful.",
    "Then we go to paint it.",
    "How do we start?",
    "But it's really good for practice with simplification.",
    "Ha ha ha ha ha right.",
    "That's such a funny summary of what I said, but it's also true.",
    "Try reconsidering the whole painting is messed up.",
    "So true, though, like sometimes, you're stuck on one area.",
    "You're like.",
    "Why is this not working?",
    "Part of the reason it's not working is because of other areas.",
    "It's like if we don't.",
    "If we don't have anything that's casting the shadow yet, the shadow is going to look at wrong.",
    "We need to get the trees in and you know all that other jazz and then then it's like.",
    "OK now are shadows will make some sense hopefully.",
    "Yeah, that's true.",
    "Excellent quote.",
    "So I'm putting some purple balance light on the side of the tree over here, just highlighting on the bark.",
    "Hi Acer welcome.",
    "How are you?",
    "We are doing some virtual Pleinair Sketch Studies Painting Studies.",
    "If you want to see the reference, they're all below the stream in the description.",
    "Alright, so let's work on a another layer.",
    "For the other tree, so new layer and.",
    "Just fill this in back here.",
    "Hi welcome, thank you.",
    "If you guys have any questions just let me know.",
    "So while following these reference we need to create our own ambience.",
    "I mean images look dull, but the way you choose the color and lighting it all comes together well.",
    "Thank you.",
    "It depends on what your goals are with your practice.",
    "These kinds of studies you know you might have a specific goal, like maybe you want to work on getting the values like the shading to be accurate.",
    "So then you would focus on that.",
    "Or maybe you want to work on selecting accurate colors to the reference so you would do that.",
    "So it depends on what you need to work on what you choose to study.",
    "So for me.",
    "I'm I used to those used to be my main focus, and since I was able to improve on those things overtime, then I've shifted my.",
    "The goal of my studies to be something a little bit more like exploring my own style.",
    "Things like you're talking about, so I will take the reference and try to.",
    "Do a little bit more of my own thing with it.",
    "You know when it comes to.",
    "The mood and stuff like that.",
    "And so anyone I mean, of course, whatever you want to do is you're welcome to do.",
    "But my point is, if you're just getting into doing these types of studies, don't feel like you have to come in here and really change things from the reference.",
    "A law or go crazy like that.",
    "You know it's fine to just just paint the reference for practice as it is, and then as you do more and more of these studies, I think you'll slowly get comfortable changing things from the reference and putting your own spin on it.",
    "And some people might feel good doing that right off the bat, but for me when I started doing these I was like.",
    "Very much just repainting the reference really accurately.",
    "Are trying to.",
    "It's a matter of opinion.",
    "If it was accurate, but you know.",
    "Oh, thank you.",
    "Thank you Claire see, I'm glad you're seeing progress was nice to hear.",
    "Hi Mona, thank you.",
    "Good morning.",
    "Good morning.",
    "Yeah, so for this one I decided that it might be nice.",
    "A nice contrast from the other reference we just did to take a little bit more of a tropical twist on this one, and it's leaning that way anyway.",
    "There's palm tree in the scene, but you know we can.",
    "Really put the colors more in that direction if you choose.",
    "Which is fun.",
    "Experiment with what makes that work.",
    "So there's an area of this branch that's getting hit by lights will put a bright.",
    "Pop of warm light back there.",
    "Maybe I'll switch brushes to something that's better for doing little little branches and things.",
    "We'll just get these in now while we're.",
    "We're working in this area.",
    "So a bunch of little branches.",
    "Well at some leaves and stuff next, I like to paint branches first.",
    "If I'm painting a tree where you actually see a lot of the branches, 'cause sometimes the trees really, really full and you see like a big blob of leaves.",
    "In those case I'll just go right for painting the groups.",
    "That leaves button it with a tree like this.",
    "I like to paint the branches first.",
    "And then paint that we use seems logical to me.",
    "Let's see Hi Mattie, I heard about UI UX designers stopping by your streams including me.",
    "Hi, welcome.",
    "Welcome, welcome well anyone is welcome to stop by.",
    "I don't have a lot of personal experience in the that kind of design.",
    "My boyfriend does.",
    "But You're welcome to you after meeting painting questions.",
    "I hope you're having a good day.",
    "Good to see you.",
    "Many artists just paint in what they see in a hyper realistic way.",
    "Yeah, Adele.",
    "That's well.",
    "That's some some artist like to paint that way always, and that's absolutely fine.",
    "If it's you know people have different tastes, so for me I kind of started of- more like that and then overtime, my tastes have changed and now I have different personal preferences and I like to explore more stylistic approach, but that definitely changed overtime.",
    "That wasn't always the case for me.",
    "Hey sour puss.",
    "This is so therapeutic thank you melody.",
    "That's really nice to hear.",
    "Was the hardest part in the process for me, probably.",
    "The what they call the ugly stage.",
    "Some paintings have it worse than others, but a lot of times when you're painting, you have to go through a period with your painting where it just looks awful like things aren't.",
    "You haven't figured things out yet or you just started blocking things in and you haven't balanced the shading yet.",
    "The values don't make sense, you know this just so common in most of the paintings that I do, there's going to be some phase where things just don't look good and you gotta just trust the process and power through that.",
    "That phase of the painting and then be able to finish it up.",
    "It's very, very normal, so I think that's the most difficult thing about painting is.",
    "Sticking with it through that all.",
    "Thank you sour puss.",
    "I'm glad you like the the format I'm enjoying this too.",
    "I had a lot of fun with it in the last stream, so that would be tried again.",
    "All right, we've got another tree up here.",
    "And it kind of disappears into the foliage.",
    "Let's see.",
    "Gotta walk my baby needs for an hour which is amazing.",
    "Oh that sounds sweet sour puss.",
    "That's really nice.",
    "Getting out of the doors these days is a celebration.",
    "Yeah, it really is.",
    "It's actually looking kinda nice outside.",
    "Now is pretty gloomy yesterday and most of today, but now we're getting some sun.",
    "Little bit of sun peeking through the clouds.",
    "Trying to figure out what to do with the palm tree here.",
    "Yeah, I think I'm just going to sketch the Frans on the layer below.",
    "What I'm working on right now.",
    "I think that will be.",
    "Easier.",
    "And then will merge the layers.",
    "So I'm going to try to keep this.",
    "Loose.",
    "So I'm not going to get 222 detailed with the palm tree.",
    "Kind of trying to remind myself that right now I like painting palm trees so I can easily get sucked in.",
    "Will add some little some little of these individual leaves.",
    "Also, sometimes when painting organic things that can be fun to take a brush, a textured brush as your eraser, and erase back up into the shape that you created.",
    "So having a cool shape of your eraser you can add details that way to buy, like subtracting from the shape.",
    "That's so cute surplus.",
    "This is four months old and has the cheeks of a hamster ready to hibernate.",
    "Oh Sounds adorable.",
    "Alright, so we got a pretty good palm tree block in.",
    "I'm going to lock the layer and do the same thing.",
    "What we've been doing and pick a let's pick a bright blue.",
    "And add a little bit of color to the.",
    "To the tree so this.",
    "Maybe we'll do it.",
    "The opposite will go all blue and then add green.",
    "So basically we're having a lot of their space between us in this palm tree and the Blue Sky Glow is sort of over like pouring over the palm tree and giving it this kind of glow effect in the in the photo.",
    "It's like very intense and I like it, so I'm going to keep keep it.",
    "Hi, very welcome.",
    "Steven says it always amazes me watching a painter work in seeming to be apparently blobbing paint onto the canvas.",
    "Then in the final five minutes a few strokes pulls off pull massive loves into a picture.",
    "It's funny, it's funny too.",
    "Sometimes it's really like a race at the end when I do these time studies.",
    "Sometimes I feel like it's not working for quite a long time and then just at the end.",
    "It's like Alright Starting to get there.",
    "Sometimes I have that feeling.",
    "I wish it was.",
    "I wish I wish I could see it more clearly and earlier sometimes.",
    "Gotta trust the blobs.",
    "Yeah yeah, I I.",
    "I grew up in Florida so I'm very familiar with palm trees.",
    "They always give me a good feeling, nostalgic kind of feeling.",
    "Group in South Florida.",
    "So we were always surrounded by Palm's.",
    "One thing I don't like is that I ended up making these.",
    "Up Frans kind of equidistant from each other.",
    "I want them to feel more random, so I'm going to add a little bit of space.",
    "In between.",
    "Ha ha ha.",
    "Alright will be will have to be satisfied with that.",
    "For now the palm tree, but I might come back and work on it later.",
    "So this was a sketch from earlier I was starting to try to fill in these darker areas.",
    "Normally, like how that looks will raise out a bit of it and just go from there.",
    "Right, but we are starting to make more sense here.",
    "It is starting.",
    "I have some see I have some brushes that have sort of a leafy texture which might come in handy here.",
    "I was because I've been going for this traditional look.",
    "I've been trying to paint everything and not rely a ton on stamp brushes with this particular style, but.",
    "When it comes to leaves then I can make an exception.",
    "I love using.",
    "Leave brushes are kind of fun for you to stamp in.",
    "I'm gonna try to work them into my painting in a way that feels natural.",
    "So as the plants are getting further and further away from us, they're also getting a little bit more pale.",
    "No, thank you.",
    "Hi Jennifer, welcome I hope you got a good rest.",
    "So let's get a little bit more of a green green.",
    "We've got a lot of Blue, Green, need some green green.",
    "Can you recommend a good welcome tablet to work on?",
    "So I'm using the Wakeham Centriq 22.",
    "If you are looking I love this tablet, but if you're looking for something in a little bit more of A.",
    "Like depending on your budget.",
    "In a lower price range, the Intuos tablets are really good.",
    "Um, I'll type that name in the chat so the interest line.",
    "I don't know about a specific one, 'cause I haven't really kept up with like what the latest models are, but I know a lot of professional artists that use those and they seem to last a long time and have good pressure sensitivity, so there are definitely an option.",
    "But the welcome is come out.",
    "The welcome brand has come out with a few different like more affordable screen tablets lately.",
    "So if you really want to get a welcome, you could look at the welcome one or maybe the 16.",
    "I think those are more reasonably priced screen tablets from them, but I really love my 22 so it kind of depends on your budget.",
    "Hey pro designer welcome.",
    "Now there's also other brands that make screen tablets.",
    "If you'd really like a screen tablet and check out some other options.",
    "So I'm not really like in love with the shape of these that I came up with over here.",
    "Then I will rework that a little bit.",
    "How long have you been painting for you make this look so easy.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Melody, I've been doing well.",
    "I've been doing art my whole life.",
    "Basically from when I was a kid.",
    "I love to draw and I always would always draw.",
    "But I got into digital painting about.",
    "Like 6 to 7 years ago, maybe like 6 1/2 years ago somewhere around there.",
    "So I've been doing digital for a long time.",
    "Doing these virtual Plein Air Studies during these times studies is one of the things that's helped me out the most in getting really comfortable and experimenting with different styles and things.",
    "So I started doing these maybe a year and a half to two years ago, and they've been like one of the most helpful things for me.",
    "I think I improved more in that time than I did in the time before, so I would definitely recommend doing these kind of studies if you're interested.",
    "All Ricardo I'm sorry to hear that.",
    "Yeah I haven't tried them out myself.",
    "I appreciate the feedback for chat.",
    "Sorry about that.",
    "I still have the palm tree on its own layer.",
    "What's actually on the same layer is the other trees, but I'm going to remove it, but on its own layer.",
    "The way I can kind of mess with the contrast and things.",
    "So I'm going to take the lasso tool to help with some of these close-up leaves.",
    "I actually love this technique.",
    "So I'm excited to show you it's a simple idea, but basically just taking the lasso tool and sort of drawing with it so you select a leaf shape and then hold shift and then make another leaf shape.",
    "And so they're pretty basic shapes.",
    "Nothing too fancy.",
    "And you could just select a bunch like this.",
    "And fill that in with either solid color or something with texture if you want.",
    "And then while it's still selected, you could give a little bit of a gradient or texture or something.",
    "Make it more interesting, and then deselect it, and you've got a bunch of leaves and then make a new layer an.",
    "I'll probably do a couple different layers of this is it's not necessarily you need things to overlap when you're doing this kind of stuff, you need to overlap for to look more natural.",
    "So probably take me a couple layers to be satisfied, but.",
    "Well, at another group believes.",
    "Um?",
    "Can you have a leave a link to your fabulous looking chair chairs manufacturer site?",
    "Although I can guess it's expensive curiosity, I don't have a link handy, but let me type the chair model in the chat for you and I'm sure just Google it.",
    "I think you'll be able to find it easily, but.",
    "It is the Noble chairs epic gaming chair and black.",
    "That's the that's The One I have.",
    "I think you'll be able to find it.",
    "All right?",
    "So will fill in the new leave shapes.",
    "You can add.",
    "Some brighter colors, not variation.",
    "You can decide which layer you want on top.",
    "We can also take another brush.",
    "And yeah, you're welcome at Keene.",
    "It's a good chair.",
    "I really like it.",
    "And we can add a like a stem, you know.",
    "We've got these floating leaves.",
    "You can get it really get away with them floating anyway, 'cause sometimes the stems can be covered up by other leaves.",
    "You don't necessarily see all this, but.",
    "Yeah, I can draw that in.",
    "Haha, this is an amazing portrait of a Tiger.",
    "Hiding a Tiger would look so good in this picture.",
    "It's good, good, good colors for a Tiger.",
    "Alright, one more layer of leaves and I think we could.",
    "Thank you, Pedro.",
    "Q.",
    "So if anything is bothering you about the other leaves, this might be time to use them to cover it up the additional ones.",
    "Thanks fishing all.",
    "Thank you Mona.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Well you guys are always welcome to join in if you like no pressure, but if you ever feeling inspired to, I always share the references that I use below the stream in the description and don't feel like you have to paint at this pace.",
    "You know I've been kind of working my way up to painting faster over the last couple of years with doing time studies, but you're still welcome to join in if you want.",
    "It's it's fun and we usually have a few people painting along.",
    "So.",
    "Just for practice, I find it's a little bit more fun to practice with other people.",
    "Sometimes it's hard to have the.",
    "I don't know the motivation to start it up.",
    "Sometimes so.",
    "Yeah, if you ever want to paint along with the stream, you guys are always welcome to do that and you can just post whatever you do, whether it's a little sketch or a more detailed painting.",
    "Whatever you have time for, you can post the results of that in the chat.",
    "Uh, we're like I always have trouble depicting the difference between foliage and leaves at a distance from the close ones, like how to give the bouquet effect?",
    "How should I deal with that?",
    "Um, depicting the difference between foliage and leaves at a distance from the close ones.",
    "OK, so there's a couple things you can do.",
    "For one, you can make as they're getting further away.",
    "Kind of like with what I did here.",
    "Make them lighter in value, so so actually lighter, more like there's hazy air between those plants.",
    "So for example, the further away plants what you can do is make them.",
    "Like I said, lighter.",
    "Sometimes you can have a more atmospheric color like add some blue.",
    "They can be more towards blue.",
    "The plants that are closer to you, they're going to be.",
    "Darker, they're going to be more the real color less of this, like blue atmosphere that happens when things are further away.",
    "And also you can paint them more detailed the further away plants you can leave them a bit blurry or loose and then the closer they get to you you want to.",
    "Paint them.",
    "Paint them more detailed I guess.",
    "I hope that makes sense.",
    "Pamela Kyle's brushes are really good.",
    "I've been on a kick of experimenting with making my own brushes, though.",
    "I got into this like I don't know.",
    "A few months ago and I'm kind of addicted to it.",
    "So the brushes I'm using right now I've made an I'm working on putting together a brush set that will be available if anybody is interested in purchasing it.",
    "I do have a brush set that's it already is available now that I've made that is a It's like a Ghibli inspired brush set.",
    "It's got a lot of watercolor textures and.",
    "Plants and foliage type things.",
    "The brush that I'm working on right now is a little bit more dry.",
    "Traditional textures like pastels, charcoals, maybe gouache with a lot of dry brushing, that kind of thing.",
    "So yeah, a little bit of both.",
    "I've certainly used a lot of other peoples brushes, but at the moment I'm I'm interested in making mine, so I'm also I'm using a lot of custom ones right now.",
    "I.",
    "See I hope I'm not missing too much in the chat.",
    "You guys.",
    "Jennifer says.",
    "I'm trying to get you a picture of the ranch where I grew up so we can all work on it.",
    "But if an effort but I'll get it, that would be really nice.",
    "That would be really nice.",
    "How are you switching from black-and-white so quickly?",
    "Yes, it's a shortcut that you have to set up, but let me show you how to do it.",
    "OK, so once you set it up one time you're going.",
    "It's always going to be there, but you have to set it up one time, so you want to go to view.",
    "Proof set up.",
    "And then custom.",
    "I'm just going to go slow in case anybody wants to write this down.",
    "I'm sure you can also look it up later, but.",
    "So view proof, setup custom and then you click that and then this box comes up and then the only thing that you need to change here is.",
    "Under the device to simulate, you need to select working grade gain 20% from the drop down menu.",
    "And then you can click OK.",
    "So mines already done.",
    "So I'm just going to cancel it.",
    "But then after that anytime that you press CTRL Y it will turn your painting into black and white and you can just press CTRL Y 2.",
    "To go back to to the colored version.",
    "All thank you Pamela.",
    "Let me get a link for you real quick.",
    "Thank you for asking.",
    "So again, this is a previous brush set that I made that you can look at in detail.",
    "Make sure you like the textures and everything.",
    "The ones that I'm using right now are in a brush that that will be coming out soon, so but I'll link you in the chat.",
    "I thank you again for asking.",
    "I saw another question.",
    "I'm just going to go back up here.",
    "My painting is about 3 year old level Steven.",
    "Love you see the painting you shared.",
    "Alright, messing around with fresco cool.",
    "I like the textures you can see the textures of the brush strokes and fresco.",
    "Hey this is cool.",
    "Hey don't please don't don't feel bad you gotta start somewhere an I mean I like what you're doing.",
    "You got a nice bold hard edge and you've got some soft edges up here that those are.",
    "Those are good signs to me.",
    "I find a lot of times.",
    "People struggle, especially at the beginning with landscape painting of including hard edges.",
    "People really shy about hard edges.",
    "I just keep just keep working on it.",
    "You guys.",
    "If you saw some of my early landscapes you might be very surprised because they didn't look like this, so that shouldn't surprise you.",
    "But you know sometimes it can be.",
    "Yeah, they were looking pretty rough when I started.",
    "Thank you, Claire Z.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Uh, see, do you ever add texture to your paintings to look like an oil canvas?",
    "Not usually Anthony.",
    "Usually I just try to do that during the painting process with the brushes and with my painting style.",
    "I don't usually overlea texture at the end I've seen people do it.",
    "It can look cool, but it's just not my thing.",
    "One thing I will do is sometimes give a little bit of noise filter, but that's about it.",
    "Yeah, no problem Judy.",
    "The best thing about that is Oh my gosh, check this out.",
    "You can actually color pic when it's in black and white, so when it's in black-and-white you can color pic its color at picking the real actual colors and you can paint with the colors too.",
    "And then when you turn it back into color, it's whatever color that you painted with.",
    "So I use that a lot when I get confused and then I try to.",
    "Like figure it out and then go back to color.",
    "Yeah, exactly saying it's non destructive, it only is going to change your view and then you press CTRL Y and it goes right back to the colored version and it hasn't done anything permanent to your painting.",
    "Hi Pablo's, welcome.",
    "Welcome welcome.",
    "So I use that a lot.",
    "The other shortcut that I've set up for myself is the flip.",
    "Which is a little less useful today.",
    "I think the flip turn this over every time.",
    "But yeah, I like to flip the canvas because it gives me a fresh look at what I'm doing sometimes after I'm painting for awhile.",
    "You know, you kind of get kind of like have a hard time even seeing any of your mistakes at that point.",
    "So flipping the canvas it kind of helps.",
    "Give you a fresh view.",
    "Um followed one of your studies.",
    "It took me days to get an awful result here.",
    "Really fast indeed.",
    "Need to practice a lot more.",
    "And realize how good I am at photo shop and how bad at drawing.",
    "It just takes time.",
    "It takes time.",
    "It will definitely benefit you that you're good with Photoshop though.",
    "Like all that knowledge is going to be really handy in digital painting.",
    "Show us your early landscapes.",
    "Yeah, I'd be happy too.",
    "I have actually gone through some of those on the streams before.",
    "One day we can do that.",
    "I wish the sad thing is that.",
    "I lost one of my older hard drives.",
    "Had even more of the like very very.",
    "First one is in the sadly those have those have been like last time, but I do still have some some early ones that I can show in that some of you guys have seen but yeah.",
    "So I'm trying to give a nice texture to these fluffy little little trees up here.",
    "Little leaves and things.",
    "So I'm going to try to explain something I hope.",
    "I hope you guys will understand what I mean, but when it comes to painting faster and practicing with these kinds of studies, one thing that helped me was letting go of my expectations of how good any particular painting is going to look.",
    "And just trying to get everything in the scene painted in in this set amount of time.",
    "So let's say an hour or so is what I wanted to spend.",
    "The amount of time I wanted to spend on a painting instead of like so for this scene.",
    "For example, early on when I started doing that, I'm studies the thing that would be tough for me is I would end up with like one of the trees looking really good.",
    "And then a lot of the rest of the painting just not even being there by the end like I would run out of time.",
    "And then there would be like a whole area that I didn't paint.",
    "You know what I mean?",
    "And so one of the things that I had to start doing was saying OK.",
    "I'm going to paint everything in, even if it looks bad.",
    "I'm just going to paint it in so I would have like.",
    "Very rough, just like almost like cartoon looking tree that I just put in so that had something in there and then I would go to start working on other things and get everything in the scene.",
    "Just everything has to be in and then you can go back and improve different areas.",
    "And So what happens is overtime as you do these studies, you get faster.",
    "And.",
    "I would end up being better at budgeting my time slowly.",
    "You're going to be able to do more, and you're going to be happy with what you can do in that amount of time, but it's really hard to get the full benefit of doing that.",
    "I'm studies if you don't really treat them like a time study and you allow yourself to.",
    "Like take along time on some area and then the other area isn't done.",
    "So even if the results end up looking what you would consider as bad.",
    "It's still a success if you're able to get everything in the scene, even if it looks rough.",
    "Just get everything in that time and then just like let that be what it was you know.",
    "That is a study and then you can like close it.",
    "Never look at it again.",
    "If you want, you know these don't have to be for your portfolio necessarily there just for practice and less you want to make them for your portfolio, but that changes things a little bit, 'cause then you start being a little bit careful.",
    "Little bit too afraid of making mistakes.",
    "So allow yourself some studies where it's OK if they don't come out great and there's no expectation of posting or sharing.",
    "It would make a cool postcard, thanks.",
    "Populous as I once painted a landscape painting, it came out so bad you wouldn't even know it was a landscape painting.",
    "It's normal, it's normal.",
    "I used to be more of a character painter when I first got into digital art, I did almost almost only characters.",
    "And now I do.",
    "Now I do primarily landscapes.",
    "It's just my interests.",
    "My interests kind of changed overtime.",
    "So anyway, I'm just bringing it Up 'cause If you if you have the idea like I'm bad at this, I'm going to a landscape painter.",
    "You can change that if you really want to get into it.",
    "Don't feel like that you're doomed or something like even if you feel like you're not good at landscapes now.",
    "That said, This is definitely something that can change overtime.",
    "If you if you spend some time working on it just like anything I need to practice more on portraits and characters 'cause I haven't been doing that lately.",
    "Yeah, exactly those kind of unexpected colors in the skin.",
    "What painters inspire you, oh man, there's a lot.",
    "There's a lot OK, so I will tell you, the painters that are like inspiring me.",
    "Currently an I feel like every month I'm discovering new artists to follow.",
    "I got every day.",
    "Actually I'm.",
    "Yeah, it's there's a lot, but artists that have been really influential to my growth have been one.",
    "Would be Nathan folks.",
    "I love his work and his teachings on school.",
    "ISM are really, really helpful.",
    "The tutorials on there.",
    "So he's 1.",
    "James Gurney is one.",
    "I have watched a ton of his YouTube videos and I have or had one of his books until I moved and I gave it away but.",
    "James Gurney, who does a lot of watercolor gouache.",
    "Work big influence.",
    "Tiffany Mang is one.",
    "I can type these names in the chat real quick.",
    "Facebook may not be familiar with them to look them up.",
    "Who else?",
    "There's an artist adjacent sheer, but let me check how to spell his name.",
    "I think I've got it.",
    "Let's see.",
    "Jeremy Fenske, Oh my God, there's just so many it's I'm feel like I'm going to forget someone important.",
    "But you guys should look these artists of their amazing, uh.",
    "Lately I've been really enjoying the Henry Wong's.",
    "Clean air studies.",
    "He does similar stuff to what I'm doing here, only like really, really good.",
    "Ah, who else?",
    "Who else?",
    "I'm forgetting.",
    "John Park.",
    "Yeah, there's a lot.",
    "There's a lot.",
    "Anyway.",
    "Those are a few that maybe you guys can get inspiration from.",
    "But I love searching through art on Instagram and Twitter and be hands and art station in all these places and finding new artists.",
    "I definitely feel like my style has changed and is changing a lot because of these people.",
    "You know, seeing their work inspires me.",
    "I want to try different things like oh, I like how they use texture.",
    "I wanna try that, you know and you end up incorporating little things here and there into your work.",
    "What other people are doing?",
    "Alright, we're getting closer to the end on this one.",
    "We're not quite there, but I'm starting to see starting to see the end of the road.",
    "I might turn off the sketch layer.",
    "I feel like we don't need it anymore.",
    "It's a little bit messy to see that sketch, and I think we got everything we need, so I'll turn that of.-.",
    "It's a very long list, I'm sorry honestly, I could go on like I could really go on.",
    "And that's been just over the last few years finding all these artists there's.",
    "There's another one.",
    "Oh, OK, there's one more.",
    "I knew I was forgetting someone, Tommy Kim, he does traditional.",
    "He does a digital and guassian.",
    "He's another one that's been really inspiring me lately.",
    "Besides yourself, who would you recommend for a beginner, non artist?",
    "Oh, let me get a link for you.",
    "Actually it might be below my.",
    "My stream in the description but let me.",
    "We make sure that we can.",
    "I don't know if the shortened link works properly.",
    "OK so I have a resources page.",
    "Yeah, Jackson enjoy.",
    "Uh.",
    "So check out the link I posted in chat, Pamela there there's a bunch of links to YouTube channels and all kinds of different resources on Gumroad.",
    "Different lots of different different tutorials and things that have helped me over the time that I've gotten into digital art and been doing that.",
    "So there's a whole bunch of things there.",
    "You know everyone has such different personal preference is it would be hard for me to recommend like one particular artist to you, but there's a lot of stuff there.",
    "A lot of different different artists that do tutorial, so you can kind of like Peru's and see if anybody's.",
    "Style appeals to you.",
    "That's my biggest advice to people that are getting into digital art or any type of art.",
    "And you're feeling kind of lost.",
    "Ask yourself, like ideally, what kind of art would you want to be able to do?",
    "Like?",
    "What are your preferences?",
    "And that means.",
    "That could mean style or could mean stop subject matter and that can change overtime as you learn more like this.",
    "Figure out what you want to do.",
    "Yeah, you're welcome.",
    "I really hope you find something helpful there.",
    "So for example, maybe you want to do portraits.",
    "Maybe you want to do animal paintings, maybe you know whatever it is an you can find a search for artists that are good at that thing.",
    "A lot of artists are selling tutorials nowadays Patris on gumroad, or doing free tutorials.",
    "There's workshops, streams, so if you find what you'd like to be able to do then you can start looking for guidance on that thing.",
    "If you don't really know what you want, it can feel really overwhelming.",
    "And just remember that just because you were starting with something doesn't mean you have to only do that thing forever, so it doesn't have to be something that you overthink.",
    "Just say, OK, I would like to be able to do portraits and just start following artists that do portraits.",
    "Just looking for them.",
    "On social media he ran be hands, watch some streams wherever whenever is convenient for you, and then you can find tutorials that way.",
    "That's what I did, and that's there's so much out there.",
    "Yeah, Pavlos gave a really good recommendation in the chat.",
    "That's a really good one.",
    "Marco Bucci.",
    "Man, I didn't list him in my top artists.",
    "I mean, I guess I gotta cut it off somewhere.",
    "But Marco Bucci is definitely been influenced with me with his colors.",
    "I absolutely love what he does with color.",
    "Haley are how are you welcome?",
    "Almost missed you there in chat?",
    "Well, I kind of.",
    "I mean I want to do more with this, but I feel like I should kind of rap this one up or I'm going to run out of time to do the other paintings for today.",
    "So I might I might like end this one here.",
    "I'll add a little bit more highlights to the.",
    "To the street here.",
    "But I think then we'll go on to the next one.",
    "I'm a photographer and always said painting gets lost at my elbow and won't come out my hand.",
    "I love landscapes.",
    "Well, photography is definitely art.",
    "Maybe maybe you'd be interested in getting into as a like a starting point.",
    "Maybe you'd be interested in like photo manipulation.",
    "Or maybe you already do that as a photographer, but you know you can certainly paint over your photos.",
    "Photo bashing is a thing, especially when they're your photos.",
    "You have complete ownership over them.",
    "You could maybe start with something like that.",
    "That's fun to do.",
    "All right?",
    "So.",
    "Last little details.",
    "I will go on to the next one.",
    "If we have time I could always come back and do some more on this, but.",
    "I will lock the layer so I don't accidentally somehow destroy this painting with some of the other ones that were doing.",
    "But yeah, here's our first 2 first paintings.",
    "Let's go on to the next one.",
    "Hopefully will have time to do for in this stream.",
    "That was my goal, although I had a little tech issues at the beginning.",
    "We were kind of catching up from then, so we'll see.",
    "We'll go for at least three, maybe 4, depending on how long things take, but the other two reference images that we have.",
    "They're both below in the description, and I'm going to.",
    "Open these so one is quite a bit more simple than the other.",
    "I'm a bit scared to be honest at this one that I picked, but somebody requested a painting a location in Singapore last week so I was looking around in there and on map crunch and you know it's kind of hard to find the perfect reference, but I found this scene which I thought was really, really pretty and just had beautiful, bright, cheerful colors.",
    "There's a lot of bounce light and interesting things.",
    "I do think it's really detailed and technical because it's a building and there's a fence and all this kind of stuff so.",
    "I think it might be a good challenge to try to simplify this.",
    "Like I said, I'm a little scared, but let's try it.",
    "Let's just try it.",
    "We gotta push ourselves a little bit.",
    "If you guys like the other image better, this was the other one which I think has cool lighting.",
    "This was the other one that was potentially going to be for our studies today.",
    "So you can do this one if you want.",
    "If you find this one more interesting.",
    "Already do photo manipulation.",
    "Thanks for all your encouragement.",
    "Cool cool, that's awesome.",
    "Always go about 2 hours and realize they didn't save.",
    "Yes, did I save?",
    "Yeah, so I'm I usually click it with.",
    "I usually click the shortcut CTRL S so I don't even remember.",
    "Sometimes when I say it 'cause it's just happening.",
    "Thank you, thank you Claire Z.",
    "Thank you Foster.",
    "Thanks everybody.",
    "All right?",
    "OK, so we've got the next image.",
    "And we're going to try again to keep pretty.",
    "To keep the our idea of getting the main.",
    "Feeling of this scene and not obsessing over every detail because there are quite a few details.",
    "So I think we can do it.",
    "Let's put the reference a little bit larger on the other monitor, so I have this next to chat.",
    "If you guys want to give it a shot, you can find the reference reference below the stream in the description.",
    "I'm going to take a quick savati before we start this one.",
    "Windows always get me Windows.",
    "Windows always get me in paintings.",
    "This one's got a lot of Windows.",
    "Gotta face our fears.",
    "Alright, we're going to do this composition.",
    "I think this one is a better shape for this scene.",
    "OK, so new layer I will do a sketch.",
    "I will do a sketch.",
    "I usually do sketches.",
    "We can get rid of the other sketch.",
    "So this will hopefully help us plan this out.",
    "OK, so here we go.",
    "If I want so if anybody feels overwhelmed by this, something that I can do to try to simplify things is think about the biggest shape possible and then work within that and make things smaller.",
    "So, for example, this house on the left, it's kind of like this at the most basic level, and then within this we've got these different floors.",
    "But we kind of got a shape like this and then down here there's another house next door.",
    "Ooh Jackson, let me see.",
    "So Jackson painted the last one with us.",
    "You guys, anybody who painted along, please feel free to share if you if you feel comfortable.",
    "Jackson this worked out really nice.",
    "I hope you're happy with it.",
    "I know you were feeling also overwhelmed by this reference.",
    "I love this texture for the the branches and leaves up here.",
    "This wispy texture that works perfectly for that type of plant.",
    "It's really, really pretty.",
    "I'm very happy with this.",
    "I hope you are.",
    "As beautiful as Purples.",
    "Lots of different variation, Hue variation up here.",
    "That was a tough one.",
    "The pathway was really tough.",
    "If I was going to come back and do anything, I probably work on my pathway a little bit more.",
    "And then we've got the ground here in the foreground, just a little bit of that.",
    "So within.",
    "This shape we've got like the top floor here.",
    "And then at the same time when we meet up with this other building next door.",
    "Got the next floor and then we've got.",
    "The.",
    "Like roof of the.",
    "The ground floor.",
    "This kind of thing, so I'm holding shift each time that I make us 'cause I'm trying to make straight line.",
    "So I'm holding shift to do that is helpful.",
    "So I think my proportions are a little off.",
    "I'm going to move this up.",
    "I think that second story.",
    "The first story seems a lot.",
    "I might just be because we're closest to it, but it seems a lot bigger.",
    "All right and then we have a fence.",
    "So I might I might try to freehand the fence.",
    "I just felt like I couldn't really do that with the house very easily, so let's try here.",
    "Something like this?",
    "And then.",
    "Got a gate in the front?",
    "And a big blocky thing.",
    "Don't know what that is in between houses.",
    "I don't know.",
    "It supports the gates.",
    "Big thing and then another gate here.",
    "So maybe we can zoom in a little bit more.",
    "Really focus on that one house and just have like a little glimpse of the neighbors.",
    "I know I'm going to have some proportions issues, but I'm going to try to keep things roughly the way they should be.",
    "So looking at the middle of this fence, this post comes up here and what is that line up with then?",
    "There's this other post here.",
    "These are the support like support beams.",
    "And this is all one solid.",
    "Yeah, structures I know, uh.",
    "There's a.",
    "There's a tree.",
    "Luckily that comes over here and covers up a bunch of stuff.",
    "Maybe we can make that re bigger.",
    "Can make the tree but put an extra tree.",
    "Um heilala I'm a graphic design student need to this platform and I really wanted to say that your work is amazing.",
    "Thank you lol welcome, I hope you enjoy it here and thank you so much.",
    "It's very nice of you and Hi Michael.",
    "Hi Mike, from UK better late than ever.",
    "Thanks for your brushes that I downloaded last week.",
    "Really enjoying your tutorials thanks that makes me happy to hear an.",
    "I hope you enjoy the brushes.",
    "Satisfied with how it turned out, the lasso tool technique for hinting leave seems pretty useful to experimenting with it lately.",
    "Lasso tool is so handy I go through phases of being obsessed with the lasso tool, and then I kind of.",
    "Lately I haven't been using it too much 'cause I've been going for this painterly effect in the lasso tool.",
    "Can be pretty precise.",
    "But I like I do like it still for those leaves.",
    "All right, so we've got step one.",
    "I'm going to try to erase away guidelines I don't need anymore as we go.",
    "'cause otherwise things are going to get really hard to understand.",
    "So get rid of that diagonal line.",
    "An I might make a new layer, so on another layer we're going to do the door and other things that might start to get.",
    "Confusing.",
    "So this.",
    "Proportion is wrong.",
    "That should be like this.",
    "So there's a door back here.",
    "Oops, I was doing that in another layer.",
    "Try it again.",
    "There's a door, and then there's a window.",
    "Oh my gosh, there's so many windows and there's something else.",
    "It's like a cabinet or something.",
    "I don't know.",
    "I'm trying not to zoom in, so.",
    "That will help me from getting too obsessed with details.",
    "Gotta window here with one 234.",
    "Add suddenly the house is a deep forest.",
    "Over here something else that's covered up by plants.",
    "Thankfully all right up here.",
    "We got more windows.",
    "Hold shift for a straight line.",
    "This sketch won't be in my final, this is just helping me place place things.",
    "We will definitely be painting painting under this sketch and will get rid of it when we can, so I don't mind if things are a little messy as long as they are.",
    "Help me put things in the right place.",
    "So this window got 3.",
    "And then we can duplicate that.",
    "But we want room for one more.",
    "Oops.",
    "Again.",
    "Why am I doing that?",
    "Oh 'cause I'm also selecting that layer.",
    "OK, and then finally we got one window over here on the 2nd floor.",
    "Oh my goodness.",
    "But I do think that the light shining off the windows is really pretty and very satisfying in the bounce light.",
    "That glow got a great lighting effect, so that is going to be the focus of this painting.",
    "Another window with three probably again, copy that other one.",
    "Same here.",
    "Do do do.",
    "And it's probably one more of the same.",
    "Over here on the left, but it's partially covered by.",
    "Archery archery friend.",
    "This place looks nice.",
    "I like it.",
    "OK, the neighbors also have some windows, so they have some kind of like a balcony here and neighbors have one too.",
    "It's like about this high.",
    "I've got trees.",
    "Not sure you sorry.",
    "We have plants hanging.",
    "Something like that.",
    "OK, so just to assess before we get into things, I think between the second and third story I need to add some more room.",
    "So I'm going to merge the windows down.",
    "So we've got all this on the same layer, and then I'm going to select.",
    "This layer and move it up because I think there's a lot more space there than what I indicated.",
    "Ahahahahaha Jackson I know I'm sorry.",
    "I don't know what I.",
    "What got into me with this one?",
    "Yeah, if you guys can see the second story, we can actually see.",
    "Underneath the roof.",
    "Facing up towards it.",
    "So here's this support beam and then back here.",
    "Is the wall.",
    "And that's all underneath.",
    "Make an impressionistic version.",
    "Yeah, my sketch is all on one layer.",
    "It wasn't earlier, but I merged down at one point when I was like happy enough with it.",
    "Usually if I'm going to overlap things, I will keep it on a separate layer and then once I do once I draw the whatever is going to be overlapping and then I think that it's OK.",
    "Then I'll merge it.",
    "Hey project, the paint things are going good.",
    "I can give you a little preview.",
    "This was the first painting of the day here and then we did like some tropical vibes over here and now we are.",
    "Starting a pretty.",
    "Technical one, but I'm going to try not to get too technical.",
    "My actual painting.",
    "I'm laying things out here 'cause I think it will help make it easier, but when we get into it, I'm going to try to focus on the lighting in the mood and maybe some textures.",
    "Maybe some nice textures.",
    "It will be very impressionistic.",
    "Alright, so here's the end of this balcony.",
    "OK well.",
    "There's some other details in the foreground.",
    "I'm getting lazy though.",
    "I kinda just want to start painting.",
    "So we might have my just like skip on through, but there's there's a like a plant pots that are attached to this.",
    "Fence.",
    "Will plants?",
    "Um?",
    "Hi Jason, Good morning.",
    "Haven't watched from your streams in awhile.",
    "Glad to be here I'll go.",
    "I'm good to see you again.",
    "Yeah we did two studies so far these two up here and now we're we're beginning with another one so we came in a good time we're just starting this got through the sketch here and we're going to begin with painting in a moment.",
    "So an example of something that I would keep on a separate layer having to do with the sketch is I would definitely make a new layer if I wanted to sketch in the tree on the left coming in front.",
    "I would want to have that on a separate layer, 'cause I wouldn't want it to.",
    "I don't know, it would just feel crazy to do it right on top of everything, but I don't even know if I'm going to sketch that in.",
    "I think I'll just like wing that in the painting phase.",
    "'cause it's a bit abstract of a shape.",
    "Anyway, I know that it takes up this whole area, but we can see through it a little bit 'cause it's kind of loose.",
    "There's a lot of space in between the leaves and branches.",
    "I think it would be hard to sketch that in without taking a really long time.",
    "So I'll just leave it out.",
    "Oh yeah, so the reference let me put it in the chat.",
    "Do.",
    "There we go.",
    "Trying to organize the.",
    "I'm trying to look at the composition.",
    "I want to give a little bit more room for the Sky up top.",
    "I think it's important.",
    "Nice blue blue Sky.",
    "OK, well let's start painting.",
    "I'm going to do a little clean up here and see what kind of random layers I have.",
    "I don't know why I have two layers that I don't even know what's on them, so will get rid of those.",
    "The other two are my other paintings will keep those.",
    "And then we'll put this layer on, multiply lower the Opacity so it's easier to see through an will, put it around 20% or so, opacity, and then lock the layer.",
    "Press the little lock icon here so we don't accidentally paint on that.",
    "And make a new layer underneath and then I'll start painting there.",
    "So.",
    "I think I will continue with the underpainting approach.",
    "So I'm trying to model this after traditional painting Workflow.",
    "I know that this might be really weird.",
    "For some people, because it was really weird for me at first when I saw artists doing this, I saw a tutorial of someone doing this kind of thing and I was like what on Earth?",
    "'cause I didn't do I started doing even though I did traditional drawing first I got into digital painting before traditional painting, so I wasn't familiar with the whole underpainting thing.",
    "So this was really weird to me, but the idea is we're going to get rid of having a white or even Gray background.",
    "We're going to have something that if we show through to this color at any point, it's just going to give a nice warm glow.",
    "Yeah, thank you, we are.",
    "Yeah, I'm in CST.",
    "I'm in the Netherlands, so for me it's actually what time is it.",
    "330, three, 30.",
    "In the afternoon it's crazy.",
    "Oh thanks Lee.",
    "OK yeah, you found them.",
    "Yeah OK so yeah so so that it helps get rid of the white.",
    "The Scary White canvas.",
    "And also it's nice because well if you look at the value you know it's somewhere in the middle ish so when you paint lighter you're going to be able to paint lighter and you're going to be able to paint darker and it helps give like a way to sort of in a sculpture away like carve out your shapes rather than just having the shade everything down from from a light color.",
    "I don't know that feels tough.",
    "Feels tough.",
    "Hi there, Liesl.",
    "I hope I'm saying Your name right.",
    "You guys can correct me if I mess up your names.",
    "Just found it yesterday.",
    "Love how you see color and light.",
    "Do you do any of your gouache paintings on live streams?",
    "All thank you.",
    "I do.",
    "Actually, I'll be doing that tomorrow on Twitch so I can put a link to that in the in the chat.",
    "I'll be doing some traditional.",
    "Painting.",
    "Every.",
    "Every.",
    "Thursday and thank you.",
    "Thank you for the nice comments.",
    "OK, so now we've got our underpainting an I will just make a new layer on top of that and then start my painting.",
    "So now I'm going to go with color for the Sky.",
    "Anne will pick something really.",
    "I want to go like really just as intense as the reference.",
    "'cause That's really blue.",
    "Yeah, that's nice.",
    "So do you see when I, when I don't perfectly cover that area you see through with this like dusty kind of texture?",
    "I love it.",
    "I love it, so that's a nice thing about doing this kind of underpainting and we can also choose.",
    "So I'm going to color pic from the blue will go a little bit later.",
    "Anna little bit towards the green and will get just a tiny bit of a different Hue.",
    "And then we can go over top to give a little bit of a gradient.",
    "Just a little bit.",
    "So then we have a soft transition between the you know 'cause the Sky is always going to be deeper blue right up top and then towards the horizon it gets brighter and brighter and a little bit more washed out color so.",
    "Forget that a little bit.",
    "So next thing I like to work big to small, so we want to get rid of the Orange.",
    "I mean we don't mind a little showing through, but we want to get everything blocked in so.",
    "Uh.",
    "Let's figure out what color goes is going on down here on the ground.",
    "So there's a big range there's.",
    "There's the area and Shadow and highlight and I'm trying not to color pic from the reference so it takes me awhile sometimes.",
    "To guess what color is there, but I feel like a color similar to this is good for the darker areas, so I might use that as a starting point, and then we're going to add the bright white highlights.",
    "Oh cool, you're starting Nathan Foxes Landscape quote schools.",
    "Of course you are going to love it.",
    "It is amazing.",
    "It is like the best course that I've taken of that kind.",
    "And honestly is one of the most helpful courses I've ever taken related to art.",
    "It goes over so many fundamental things.",
    "It's really, really good.",
    "And he actually does a couple digital demos in that, even though it's like a watercolor and gouache thing, he does a couple digital demos, which was like a really cool surprise for me as a digital artist.",
    "That was like wow.",
    "This is awesome, so don't be nervous.",
    "It's going to be great.",
    "All thanks, you guys use colored gesso, that's awesome.",
    "That makes sense, yeah.",
    "So my experience so far.",
    "I do mostly like I do mostly guassian traditional so I don't have a lot of experience with gesso and things like oil and acrylic, so that's cool to hear about.",
    "So I'm trying to find a nice sort of shadow color for the building.",
    "Just as a starting point, I'd certainly want to get a lot brighter than this.",
    "But I really like the glow that's happening inside under the.",
    "For example, under their roof.",
    "Where there's like a little bit of a glow, and then you get the bright.",
    "Bright sun so hey, maybe I'll have to go back and forth to get the right colour.",
    "Maybe it will take a little time.",
    "OK, so I think for me this is actually enough that I'd like to start with the bright white areas and this painting.",
    "I feel like I'm going to use some selection tools to make sure things are pretty crisp.",
    "Even though I want a painterly look, I want those textures to exist within strong shapes that are going to make this easy to look at and understand what's going on.",
    "So I'm going to use the rectangle marquee tool to just select direct angle.",
    "And then we're going to pick a color that's really bright, almost pure white, but not quite there.",
    "What will figure out what's a good color for this area, but?",
    "And here we go.",
    "I'm just going to fill in this area around the windows where the really, really bright sun is shining on this house.",
    "Anne, I want the.",
    "The light to end kind of around the same area.",
    "what I could do is use a another brush and just erase out a straight line across everything that would also do it.",
    "Using gold gesso underwater color gives a bit of a glow.",
    "That sounds really pretty gold gesso.",
    "I didn't even know that existed.",
    "That's cool.",
    "Yeah, cool thing with using texture brushes like this on buildings is that it can give you that look like stucco or something.",
    "I mean, this building is honestly pretty smooth looking but yeah, it's an interpretation.",
    "So maybe I'll select a similar brush for the eraser so it can erase down into it, or very straight across.",
    "Depends on how bowl do you want to be with that?",
    "But looking at the reference, I think actually I should probably go a little higher.",
    "Oops.",
    "There we go, that's better, Yeah, Alright, let's go down to the next floor.",
    "I think this will make a lot more sense after we have the bright white in.",
    "Next thing would probably be windows for me.",
    "I'm doing this all on a separate layer too, so we might be able to easily edit things once I feel like I'm happy with where everything is, I'll merge it down.",
    "Got a little bit left to do before I feel confident about that.",
    "So holding shift go across for straight line.",
    "Hold shift.",
    "We don't need any bright areas in the middle here.",
    "That's going to be.",
    "Shadow One thing that I've learned is if you want your highlights to really, really stand out, there's only.",
    "You can only go so bright you know there's only you can only go to a maximum of pure white, so.",
    "What we could do is go to the background and go to like curves or brightness contrast and like kind of dark and things.",
    "Lube it more in everything else.",
    "I don't know.",
    "I don't know if I like what that does to the Sky that makes the Sky really intense.",
    "I might have to just work on darkening the building.",
    "I'm OK with how things are, but that's just a tip.",
    "Sometimes.",
    "If you're having trouble making the glowy areas look as Glowy as you want, or as bright as you want, you can consider darkening the other areas around it.",
    "Like relative.",
    "To that, and usually that helps make that area really pop.",
    "But I think I'm OK with how it is.",
    "what I might do is go a little bit more towards pier way in a couple areas.",
    "The nice thing about doing a sketch for this one is now it's like pretty relaxing overall to.",
    "Do like fill in the shapes.",
    "You wouldn't think of painting buildings is being relaxing.",
    "Putting the time in for the sketch makes this a bit more.",
    "Relaxing.",
    "See, these aren't lined up properly to the reference book.",
    "Hopefully it'll work.",
    "We've got a another highlight across the bottom here.",
    "And.",
    "We've got some dappled light on the.",
    "On this fence, so will have to come back and add more shadows, but I'll go pretty brave with it for now.",
    "Just to block in the shape.",
    "Cool.",
    "What am I missing?",
    "We've got other areas that are going to be bright, but I think these are the brightest.",
    "So I'm going to lock the layer that already do that, no lock the layer.",
    "Of course we're going to lock the layer there and then we can go brighter and then.",
    "Go even even more Bray just in a couple spots like right right where the brightest light is hitting were almost looks overexposed in the photo we can go a little bit brighter there.",
    "And that's it.",
    "That's the phrase I think I will go.",
    "Saying, says Daniel Smith, paint is made in Seattle.",
    "They have a pretty goal.",
    "Gesso and wonderful granulating watercolors.",
    "I've heard good things about Daniel Smith.",
    "I didn't know it was made in Seattle.",
    "That's so cool.",
    "Very cool.",
    "My sister lives well nearish to there.",
    "Awesome.",
    "OK, so I'm going to make a new layer under this layer.",
    "I think it might be easier to paint the windows.",
    "Having that having the white layer separate, so we'll see I won't merge it quite yet.",
    "I usually like to merge pretty often with these studies, but.",
    "OK, I think the next thing is that I want to work on are probably the rooftops and then it'll be hopefully easier to understand what's going on with these buildings.",
    "So up here, maybe I'll start with a.",
    "This warm, almost like Terra cotta ish color and then we can go a little bit brighter for some highlights.",
    "We can lock that layer.",
    "And just kind of do a little bit of a stripe like this is kind of a fun thing about doing.",
    "The stylized work is you can sometimes hint at things in a way that isn't necessarily realistic, but it gets the job done.",
    "It's kind of fun, so using patterns and stuff.",
    "A little shadow over here.",
    "That's pretty bright.",
    "Don't know if I like that.",
    "Better.",
    "Maybe a little shadow Ray on the Ridge here so it's.",
    "We can get a feeling of that edge.",
    "I like to do these little dots for a tile roof.",
    "Oh, thank you.",
    "Thank you, Robert.",
    "That's very nice of you.",
    "I'm glad you like my my gosh work.",
    "I think I've heard that comparison before.",
    "That's cool.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Yeah, I love bright colors.",
    "You guys I can't help that.",
    "That's one of the things that I love about gouaches for someone who likes bright colors and how bright you can get things in digital gouaches great 'cause you can also get really bright.",
    "OK, so this the roof here is a little bit darker.",
    "I think it's partially to do with the angle and maybe that tree.",
    "Or maybe it's actually just a different color?",
    "Is a different house.",
    "So some highlights here to show the reflection.",
    "This roof is definitely made out of some kind of different, but it looks like a different.",
    "Texture to me.",
    "It looks very reflective.",
    "We may come back to that.",
    "I'm not crazy about that, but well, at least get some of the reflection in.",
    "Here.",
    "We're going to get some shadows, so if you're having trouble picking colors for shadows and highlights in your work, here is something that I like to do is, for example this.",
    "I would consider be like real color or the local color of that.",
    "Roof is just a guess 'cause we're seeing it at an interesting angle with a lot of shadows and highlights, but this is what I'm guessing is close to the color that that roof actually is.",
    "And then.",
    "If you drag, if you color pic from there then you can go to your color wheel, go towards a darker color.",
    "Just drag that colored down and maybe will go a little bit more towards purple to have like a cooler Shadow and then you can access from there.",
    "If that's a good color for your shadow.",
    "If you want it to be darker or something like that.",
    "What is the name of your color wheel software?",
    "It is called Coulouris.",
    "If you look below the stream in the description, there is a link Anna Discount Code for it.",
    "If you're interested.",
    "It is a a plugin that is like a third party plugin.",
    "So if you have photo shop CC 2019 or any more recent 2019 or 2020 then you will have a similar color wheel just already included.",
    "That's a somewhat recent update, so if you go to window.",
    "Color.",
    "Then you can find it there.",
    "It might show up like this.",
    "The Hue Cube 'cause this I think was the default, so you can just go up here and select a color wheel.",
    "So this is similar and this is already included, but the cooler is has some extra features.",
    "It has gamut masks and things that can help you with different color schemes like you know hooking you up with secondary colors and different things like that.",
    "I honestly don't use that stuff too much, but for some people might be really nice to have depends.",
    "But I just like the triangle.",
    "I really like the picking the colors from the triangle personally.",
    "I find it easier for some reason.",
    "Some people really prefer the qubits.",
    "Apparently it's a personal thing.",
    "But yeah, I like the triangle format.",
    "Yeah, thank you.",
    "Thank you Millie.",
    "Yeah you can find it below.",
    "So we'll put a.",
    "Honestly, the underpainting color seems like a pretty good color for the area below the window.",
    "Tired out the window.",
    "The overhang of the roof on the 2nd floor.",
    "That color seems like it's working pretty well.",
    "Let's do windows.",
    "Let's do windows.",
    "I do feel like I'm a little all over the place, but I'm just trying to look at what areas have big shapes that need to be filled in so the White was really standing out to me as being like really important.",
    "And then the roofs were really big.",
    "And now I just think, OK, Windows should be next so I don't know.",
    "I try to explain my thought process, why I'm doing what, what, in what order, and sometimes I'm not even sure.",
    "But yeah, we're trying to get the big to small get through these important.",
    "Aspects so for the windows we could do something like this an make a selection with the.",
    "Rectangular marquee tool.",
    "So we make make one rectangle and then hold shift and you can make another rectangle and then hold shift and you can do something like that.",
    "And let's see what it looks like.",
    "Let's see if it ends up looking to mechanical or if we like it.",
    "So how to choose the right color?",
    "So we can drop in a color for the window.",
    "And then let's put in a highlight.",
    "So wherever the white is stopping, that's where we're going to that whole area.",
    "Below there, we want to have a lighter color.",
    "So we want to highlight to match up.",
    "You know, 'cause The Sun's hitting the windows and the wall.",
    "Hey, that could be a fairly fast way to do that.",
    "I do think that I'm too bright with the window.",
    "Let's Dark in that little bit.",
    "We are, it says, a little artist trading cards size.",
    "Quick sketch.",
    "Wait, you did a quick sketch of this one that is OK.",
    "Is the one before we are.",
    "I was like how?",
    "This is so pretty.",
    "I love it.",
    "It has a great enerji yeah really nice enerji impressionist.",
    "That kind of feeling.",
    "Is this pastel again?",
    "I love that texture.",
    "I gotta work on a texture I gotta work on a brush that looks like that.",
    "Lee art.",
    "I'm going to try to make a brush based off of your painting.",
    "Your pastel painting style.",
    "With Clarice, can you have the Hue Cuban RGB sliders at the same time?",
    "Oh I have no idea.",
    "I've actually never tried to do that.",
    "I actually don't even know if you can have the cube in Coulouris.",
    "I've never tried to use the cube before here.",
    "I don't know if they have one.",
    "Yeah, I don't know.",
    "I don't think you have the cube.",
    "I don't think you have the cube.",
    "Do you?",
    "Do you use the cube?",
    "Instead of the.",
    "The Triangle.",
    "Never looked for it before, but I don't see it.",
    "I didn't see it in the settings.",
    "All right, so we've got windows.",
    "I mean, I could just duplicate this window.",
    "Can shift it a little bit more towards blue.",
    "So I'm trying not to color pic from the reference, but sometimes it gets to the point where I might breakdown and do it soft pastels.",
    "So pretty so pretty.",
    "I was going for that kind of thing with this brush actually, but.",
    "I got more work to do.",
    "What are you using Strama computer?",
    "I am using a Wakeham Centriq 22.",
    "It's a screen tablet.",
    "I'll type the model in the chat.",
    "So you can look it up if you like.",
    "Alright, I will continue with the windows in this manner, 'cause I feel like it's working pretty well.",
    "So.",
    "Yeah, I might just duplicate once and then.",
    "These windows have a little bit of a different lighting to them.",
    "There's more sons will do these.",
    "Separately, will do with their own.",
    "Their own painting.",
    "Alright, so I'm selecting everything we can select this one too.",
    "And this can be a starting point.",
    "I'll color pic from what I have over here on that window and then these are just going to get a little brighter.",
    "So this one is basically the same, but then we get.",
    "Bees get super bright lot of light hitting.",
    "You're a Hue Cube fan.",
    "I didn't know this about you.",
    "I'm just kidding.",
    "I wish I was, you know, it was a problem for me for awhile till I found something and now it's The Standard and well, not standard, but it's an option in Photoshop so.",
    "No problem, that's cool.",
    "Yeah, I don't think it has the Hue Q.",
    "Oh Ryan Oh my goodness, how are you still awake?",
    "I'm wondering if we should make a set up section.",
    "Actually, now that you mention that that would be amazing.",
    "Yeah, we are having a lot of, you know similar questions which I don't mind.",
    "You guys are totally fine to ask that.",
    "'cause like somebody you might not be here when somebody asks it earlier like don't feel bad if you want to know something, just ask me.",
    "But yeah, yeah and it may be that would be good.",
    "To be able to put a section for like.",
    "Tech details and stuff.",
    "OK so yeah we got top floor windows.",
    "So one thing I might want to do is.",
    "Come in between these windows and bring that color little bit of.",
    "That White glow.",
    "The wall paint color.",
    "And if I turn off the sketch, if I can find that layer.",
    "Yeah, then well, we see that a lot of areas are not blocked in yet, but you can see how the.",
    "How the windows look?",
    "Put that back on.",
    "Michael says there is an Adobe extension in Photoshop 2020 called Adobe color themes, which is worth a look.",
    "Cool, thanks.",
    "The non triangle.",
    "Oh, thank you as well.",
    "OK so yeah we go on.",
    "Right?",
    "Oh, hang in there.",
    "I hope I hope you're almost done.",
    "I'll put a little bit of a shadow under the.",
    "Under the roof, turning on, turning that layer on a Nov or that really made me realize I need to work on this area.",
    "Oh yeah, yeah Ryan.",
    "Absolutely no.",
    "I totally know what you meant.",
    "Totally know even I just didn't want to discourage anyone.",
    "Alright, the same will add A.",
    "Highlight a little bit of a cooler color.",
    "I absolutely love this in the reference.",
    "If you guys can pick up on it underneath the so the 2nd floor underneath the roof.",
    "There's there's some bounce light and.",
    "It's just, it's really, really pretty.",
    "It's a little bit.",
    "I don't know what color it is.",
    "Honestly, let's call it pick and find out what color is.",
    "It's that color.",
    "What do you call that?",
    "If this color.",
    "But it looks really cool compared to everything else like wow.",
    "Mine is like way too bright.",
    "That's OK, I'm going to keep going 'cause I've been working a relative to the other colors in my painting, so I want to change it now, but.",
    "Yeah, I really like that highlight.",
    "Oh that's awesome Ryan great.",
    "I'm glad to hear it.",
    "Get a little bit more of a shadow under the top here.",
    "OK.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Who merged that down?",
    "Gotta start merging things.",
    "I don't like it when there's too many layers.",
    "Will merge the windows.",
    "And merge this too.",
    "OK so we have.",
    "Basically everything on the same layer right now.",
    "And we're going to add more windows.",
    "So let's do the same thing we did before will make a selection.",
    "For the windows and I wouldn't look into a bunch at once.",
    "So here do do do.",
    "And here.",
    "I'm trying to leave a little space in between the windows.",
    "For the wall.",
    "I call that color.",
    "Desaturated cappuccino brilliance.",
    "I'm like I'm not even going to try.",
    "I like that.",
    "I could go for a cappuccino right now.",
    "All right, and one more over here.",
    "Maybe we'll just select all these.",
    "Shall we do it all?",
    "Will just get all these will do assembly line windows.",
    "So I'm holding shift to add to this election every time and you can hold alt to subtract from it if you select too much.",
    "You can also control Z.",
    "You can undo a selection, so.",
    "Super handy.",
    "Down here we've also got windows.",
    "Let's just get 'em all.",
    "So for example, down here, if I select with the rectangle tool, then I end up overlapping some other things, so I can hold alt and.",
    "Deselect areas.",
    "And let's go back here.",
    "Dude.",
    "Do.",
    "OK, we got a whole bunch of window selected, so let's see what we can do with them.",
    "So one thing you can do if you feel safer painting like this is you could just drop in a flat color on all of 'em.",
    "So and then you could paint on top of that because you'll have you'll be able to do a lock transparency could press that button and then little checkerboard button on the top of your layers palette.",
    "Then anything you do will only affect those shapes.",
    "So if you feel like it's too, it doesn't feel comfortable having this big selection.",
    "I don't mind having this election for a long time, it doesn't really bother me too much, but.",
    "If you want to, you can feel something in there, but for me we're just going to go like this.",
    "Through the windows.",
    "So the next one down here, this one is pretty dark, so we'll start with our shadow color and maybe go even darker, maybe a little bit blue.",
    "So those windows are pretty dark and had a couple little highlights.",
    "Things look shiny.",
    "Down here so we have a shadow from the.",
    "Yeah the the overhang of the roof here.",
    "Love the right windows on the top floor looks like cloud reflection.",
    "Thank you, thank you.",
    "Yeah, I could see that.",
    "I wonder what really is I, I'm sure.",
    "Well, the sun is really bright, so that's part of it.",
    "But you're right, it looks like clouds.",
    "That's awesome.",
    "I didn't even think about that.",
    "So we'll make these pretty bright too.",
    "We can go a little bit more from a blue green blue to a blue blue.",
    "And then the bottom.",
    "We've got pretty dark windows.",
    "Clever is so funny.",
    "Yeah, there's been a lot of instances of excluded windows from my paintings, seriously?",
    "There's been a lot of times where I just especially getting speed studies where I'm like we don't have time for Windows well.",
    "Yeah, specially windows and reflected things.",
    "But here I'm trying to make up for it all in one painting, trying to get all the windows in this one.",
    "I want to put some random little shines in here.",
    "Little tiny reflections and things.",
    "And these windows are pretty dark over here.",
    "OK.",
    "Are we bear?",
    "A little extra.",
    "Contrast.",
    "OK, we deselect and this is what we have man.",
    "Those windows on the bottom they just seem like super out of place.",
    "It's just because they're so dark and everything else around them.",
    "It doesn't quite fit in yet so we'll get there.",
    "Will get there.",
    "We just gotta work on the other things around those windows and it will start to make more sense.",
    "But yeah.",
    "So.",
    "Are we still need the we still need the sketch layer, but I'm looking forward to not needing it anymore.",
    "Let's work on making that happen, so I want to fill in everything that.",
    "Right now we're relying on the sketch for.",
    "So one thing would be the.",
    "Looks like a metallic kind of affect on the edge of the roof.",
    "So we'll make a new layer, paint that in.",
    "We can lock the layer and then if we wanted to look metallic or shiny then we need contrast so it looks like there's some little like ripples in it.",
    "Hello mother ship welcome thank you thank you.",
    "Can't be faulted, their windows were meant to look past am clever.",
    "I see where you get your name.",
    "That's going to be excused from now on.",
    "Thank you.",
    "A little bit of highlights to make this look shiny.",
    "Does it read?",
    "OK from afar.",
    "Hopefully we can always paint over it.",
    "I'll try not to get too upset, obsessed?",
    "OK, let's go to the second floor and do the same thing.",
    "Just hold shift.",
    "For straight line.",
    "I think there's a little bit of reflection of light from the trees, so we get a little bit of green on this.",
    "Just a tiny bit.",
    "It's nice that we have a straight on view and I can just hold shift to make a straight line.",
    "If it was, if we had a different angle.",
    "Then I wouldn't be there.",
    "Wouldn't be so convenient.",
    "So adding some highlights.",
    "To the roof.",
    "The.",
    "The refund Papa the first first floor hoops.",
    "Tried to make a straight line and that's what happened.",
    "That out.",
    "OK.",
    "Michaelsayscolor.adobe.com great place to play and find colors which can then be saved straight to your library.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Thank you for the suggestion.",
    "OK.",
    "So the next thing I want to do is where the roof on the top I want to pick a darker, almost Brown.",
    "Color.",
    "We are getting a bit of a hard shadow right under the tiles and it's pretty intense.",
    "The contrast I'm going to do this on a separate layer 'cause I'm still unsure about the colour I'm I'm choosing to go a little less saturated.",
    "Do you want to see something cool?",
    "Yeah, definitely.",
    "And will try.",
    "Doing that same thing here.",
    "Maybe if I apply the shadow to more than one?",
    "Floor it will start to.",
    "Start to work.",
    "Gotta get that highlight on this one too.",
    "This house is.",
    "Really pretty.",
    "I want to I want to get this.",
    "Top of the second roof.",
    "The roof on the second floor.",
    "A little bit more the right colors right now.",
    "Whoops, we just have the blue Sky.",
    "Showing, but we want this.",
    "Peachy color instead.",
    "Try to rotate the view and raw with the shift key down.",
    "Try to rotate OK.",
    "Actually, what is the shortcut for rotate?",
    "I literally never do it.",
    "Let's have to do it this way.",
    "Oh wait, that's The Transform.",
    "Whew.",
    "Every once in awhile I rotate by accident, but I actually don't know how to do it on purpose.",
    "Can somebody tell me how?",
    "Yeah, I like we were talking about earlier today, but I only ever flipped my canvas for some reason.",
    "Well, there's a little bit of back story as to why, but I never rotate it and I don't even know how to do that.",
    "But I'm curious what happens.",
    "It's just R.",
    "Oh yeah, I should've known that I OK yeah it's are OK so we've rotated.",
    "And.",
    "Now I'm going to hold the shift.",
    "Ah.",
    "So it's still.",
    "It's still horizontal, but because I've rotated that can make the line in that direction just R.",
    "Thanks, Ryan.",
    "Thanks you guys.",
    "That's cool.",
    "Maybe that's a reason for me to actually rotate my canvas.",
    "So we were talking about earlier like why do I not rotate and the basically the story is I used to do some.",
    "Process videos and things and I notice that when I would record and try to speed up the process of me painting with.",
    "When when I would rotate the canvas it would make it really not nice to watch the video sped up 'cause it would be like very jarring with everything.",
    "Tilting around all the time, so for process videos I kind of got out of the habit of.",
    "Using that function and then I just started relying on flipping the canvas, which also can be a little bit annoying if you speed the video up a lot.",
    "But yeah, I got used to just only flipping every so often and then I never use rotate anymore.",
    "Didn't even know what the command was.",
    "Anyways, the shift draws actually constraint to the views horizontal vertical, so you can draw straight lines at any angle by rotating the view.",
    "That's cool, thank you, thank you for that trick.",
    "I might use it in the future, 'cause that comes up sometimes.",
    "You can also do the make A dot and then making a hold shift to make another dot and it'll make a line between the dots, but you see what happens here.",
    "So for example dot, you can barely see my DOT but thought shift dot.",
    "Oh, because the weight here we make it on the layer above, so dot shift dot but it will apply the like pressure sensitivity of your brush, so you'd have to turn of- transfer an shape dynamics to make that work you know.",
    "Yeah, so then then then you get that straight line, but it won't.",
    "It won't be.",
    "You won't be able to like use the.",
    "Control things as much.",
    "Nice.",
    "OK, well I'm glad it helped.",
    "Thank you, thank you David.",
    "OK, so let's.",
    "Get back to our house.",
    "I think I'll merge down what we've done so far.",
    "Will keep going what?",
    "What else do we need to put in?",
    "To the sketch so that we can get rid of the sketch.",
    "So I want a new layer and I'm just going to work on some things.",
    "Oops, let's let's get my transfer back on my brush.",
    "Yeah, I don't like to work without that.",
    "Just make sure that the lighting is making sense.",
    "Like where does this white glow end should be the same on both of these columns?",
    "Thanks, I'm hoping that will help me about a tablet years ago, but almost never use it because it was always wanting to turn it and it doesn't work like that all there you go.",
    "OK are are an you can turn everything.",
    "Yeah, thank you.",
    "Thank you, David.",
    "OK, so let's figure out I don't really know what happened over here, but for some reason this roof is like really far away from the other house with.",
    "That's not how it should be.",
    "Let's get these guys a little closer.",
    "Leart says I'm actually used to not rotating the canvas due to doing traditional art, so you don't rotate.",
    "So for me I never rotate my paintings when I'm doing gouache painting for example, 'cause usually it's taped down to a board or to my desk.",
    "But if I'm sketching with pencil or pen, I do find that I will like rotate the paper if it's like the papers loose if it's not taped down then I will.",
    "I will turn it.",
    "It kind of depends on the medium.",
    "So I want to go a little bit more towards green and a little bit darker for this.",
    "Shadow under here.",
    "It's maybe a little bit about Yankee color on its own, but I think in the scene it's kind of nice.",
    "And it's a result of bounce light.",
    "There's a bunch of plants and things I think those might be affecting it.",
    "Light bounces off the plants.",
    "So I'm looking at the time I do think we're going to end up just finishing this painting for the day.",
    "I don't know if, well, I think we won't have time to do a fourth.",
    "'cause this one is turning out to be a bit time consuming and we had some tech issues earlier.",
    "So yeah, I think we'll just finish up this one and that will be my goal for this stream today.",
    "Just for you guys that were.",
    "Following along with the paintings.",
    "And these windows also should be a little bit lower.",
    "I think I made them a little bit too high.",
    "There's a bit of space under there between.",
    "So little shadow under that like overhang.",
    "Bring that will further over to this side comes.",
    "Out over top of.",
    "That other post.",
    "Very cool.",
    "Thank you yeah I am project I've been using actually one brush from most of this painting.",
    "I think I did the underpainting with a different brush and other than that I've been using one brush.",
    "I'm really happy like it.",
    "I've been enjoying it too.",
    "Alright, let's get some light on the ground as well.",
    "There's some bright light hitting the pavement.",
    "Yeah exactly, we are.",
    "I'm going for a soft pastel kind of look.",
    "So there's these kind of streaky shapes.",
    "I think it's just from water washing down the driveway out into the street, so you get this kind of streaky look down here.",
    "So looking at the reference.",
    "So I'm going to lighten things up and then I think add the darker streaks back in.",
    "I'm just looking at it and it looks mostly lighter, so I think maybe that's a better starting point, mostly lighter.",
    "And then we'll add the dark colours then.",
    "And then over here on the ground it gets a bit darker.",
    "Thanks.",
    "So here we go.",
    "Kind of Fanning outward like this.",
    "And I'm going to flip my canvas to try to get a fresh look.",
    "I've been painting from one angle for a long time and I probably should've flipped it earlier.",
    "Yeah, now when I see this, it makes me want to.",
    "Bring this a little bit higher.",
    "Yeah, that feels better I think.",
    "And we see this sidewalk go all the way into this like courtyard area going up to the front door over in the neighbors.",
    "And we're also going to get a bunch of plants and stuff over there.",
    "So that's an area I should probably.",
    "Try to get rid of all this orange.",
    "There's a window in here.",
    "Something, or maybe it's a door, I don't know.",
    "You can also hold Elan use the lasso tool with your brush.",
    "Who?",
    "You know that would really be super handy for me, Michael, thank you for bringing that up.",
    "I think I will.",
    "Maybe I'll reprogram that to a different key.",
    "I've reprogrammed most of my hot keys to the left hand because then it's like so much easier for me to reach them if I'm trying to figure out where L is on, like looking over at my keyboard.",
    "Yeah, that one.",
    "I would use a lot.",
    "I would use that old time, yeah?",
    "And then it goes back to the brush.",
    "I probably should have.",
    "Got that one set up earlier.",
    "We aren't going to need three versions of the brush, one for hard soft pastel, one for medium, an extra soft.",
    "Hey, if you.",
    "No pressure, but if you would like if you were inspired too if you like.",
    "Scribbled like on the paper a little bit with those different examples of those three, I would definitely use it as inspiration.",
    "I would use it to help design the brushes.",
    "Or if you have any paintings where you used them and you.",
    "He didn't mind sharing.",
    "I would definitely take a look at that.",
    "'cause I don't have a ton of pastels myself.",
    "I have just that one set.",
    "But it would really help to see I've actually been watching some videos on YouTube to try to see people painting with different materials.",
    "And that helps too, but.",
    "Ha.",
    "Nice project.",
    "Paid 2D and 3D.",
    "They combine very well.",
    "So you'll be in good shape.",
    "We decide to.",
    "OK, so let's start with some foliage.",
    "Finally, will paint some plants.",
    "Let's flip this over 2.",
    "So right now I'm working on the left in neighbors area.",
    "Or maybe that's still their house.",
    "I don't know.",
    "This could be just like a really Big House.",
    "It looks like it's their neighbor though.",
    "And then over the neighbors place.",
    "I'm going to start with some.",
    "Darker brownish green maybe will put a little shadow underneath there too.",
    "And then we'll go from there into a more green green as we get into the real color of the plants.",
    "Move our way up into so when I'm painting plants I like to areas that are in shadow.",
    "I like to use more of a blue, green, darker color is something I've noticed from doing a lot of photo studies.",
    "So sometimes even in a scene where it's not so dramatic, I still like to use this as a sort of how I how I do it.",
    "So Blue Green in the shadows and then getting more up into a yellow green as it gets brighter and brighter than that will make it look more like the sun is hitting the plants.",
    "So I kind of like the vibe that I'm getting from sticking with this texture throughout the painting, so I'm going to try to resist going and grabbing different brushes.",
    "Right now when I paint foliage I have, I usually have a lot of fun with like grabbing different brushes and trying them out, but I'm going to try to stay loyal to this one because I think in the end it might give a nice look, but there is.",
    "There's a cool plant up here that's got this kind of leaf, so let's do that.",
    "It's a little little star burst kind of thing.",
    "Give a little bit of a variety to the type of plants we see here really.",
    "Oh my gosh, thank you leave.",
    "That would be awesome.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Alright, so I'm painting this on a separate layer, thankfully because I want to do something underneath there.",
    "There's a part of the architecture that I haven't really paid much attention to yet, but over here we've got a wall that comes out and comes towards us and the color in there's a little alcove in there, so I just want to put that warm ish color behind the foliage here and that will make more sense.",
    "Trying to match the reference.",
    "We're getting closer to not needing the sketch anymore, but we've really needed it this whole time.",
    "All right?",
    "So there's our plants I want to go to a lighter color green.",
    "For some of these leaves that are getting hit by.",
    "Late.",
    "And then if we go down we get more and more into the darker Blue Green.",
    "Not sure if I like that I'm going to put that layer behind the other one.",
    "I think that's just a little peek, little bright green peeking through.",
    "That's that's fine.",
    "I would like to go back and do more with this foliage later, but.",
    "I want to move on now.",
    "There's going to be a fence covering good amount of it, so I don't want to go too crazy and then have to paint over all that.",
    "That's the worst, that's sad when that happens.",
    "Kind of get attached to an area you paint, and then you realize, oh wait, that has to get covered by a bunch of stuff.",
    "So there's some kind of I don't know if it's like a storage cabinet or something.",
    "There's some kind of Brown rectangle over here.",
    "That's all I know.",
    "That in.",
    "Part of house, it has a little bit more of a warm color.",
    "So let's try it again.",
    "Oh yeah, I'll move this back.",
    "Forgot about my reference.",
    "Hello.",
    "For some reason my shortcuts not working anymore to flip this.",
    "OK sorry guys, oh there we go.",
    "There we go OK, I don't know what I was doing wrong but we got it.",
    "Little warm light in between the windows.",
    "Maybe nice to paint over the edges of windows so they don't look so.",
    "Clean compared everything else in the painting.",
    "And we can go even a warmer color for the door, so it's a pretty door.",
    "Wooden door with a bunch of details.",
    "We're not going to do all the details, but.",
    "And get this nice warm color.",
    "You can really tell there's a lot of glow.",
    "Details on the side.",
    "And then gold handles.",
    "I think I could add a little bit more light on either side of the door.",
    "There's quite a bit of bounce light here, just like we're seeing on the ceiling in the second.",
    "2nd floor.",
    "Ha ha.",
    "I was getting worried too.",
    "I I don't know what happened.",
    "OK, so there's going to be a fence covering a lot of what happens here, but I'm just going to put in a light background.",
    "So what we're doing is we're seeing through the fence into the like the pavement that's reflecting a lot of light on the ground here.",
    "So make a new layer and.",
    "Pick a color for the fence and we might end up changing this.",
    "Till we find the right color.",
    "But I think this is OK start with.",
    "So let's just hold shift.",
    "And make a bunch of.",
    "I'm going to keep my brush the same size.",
    "So the the slots of this fence will be the same size.",
    "This is on its own layer, just have to double check.",
    "OK, and then we'll go with a darker, almost black color.",
    "Oops, that's too dark.",
    "Around the outside.",
    "Maybe less saturated, it looks like it's some kind of metal and it's reflecting a cool color.",
    "Is the blue Sky.",
    "So something like that.",
    "It could be a little bit more room the top.",
    "There we go.",
    "OK.",
    "So there's our fence.",
    "And.",
    "Yeah, it's a little bit busy.",
    "It's a little bit busy.",
    "So what we can do is underneath that layer we can maybe try to make things.",
    "Cleaner so that the fence.",
    "This, like stripes of the fence, will be easier to see.",
    "Or maybe it maybe it's not so important.",
    "We can test things out.",
    "So the door comes down a little lower so we can have the color of the door coming behind there.",
    "Same thing over here.",
    "Yeah, we don't see through a lot.",
    "I mean, you can't really tell in detail what's going on behind there so we don't have to get too detailed and crazy with our rendering behind there.",
    "But yeah, that's a little bit better.",
    "Just allude that there's some stuff going on.",
    "Merge that down.",
    "Alright, I'm excited that we're getting into more finishing things.",
    "It's hopefully going to start coming together.",
    "An plants plants.",
    "I've been waiting for that.",
    "So one thing we can do before we merge the.",
    "The fence I could duplicate the layer.",
    "If you want a more solid look.",
    "Also, we can lock the layer here an add some shadows and highlights like for example if you want the bottom to be darker or if you want.",
    "A darker shadow underneath of individual slots of the fence.",
    "You could do that, maybe that will help it look more 3 dimensional.",
    "So doing the same thing with the holding shift for straight line.",
    "And just doing a tiny little bit underneath each.",
    "Thing It doesn't take too long I mean, I think it's worth it.",
    "You can do the same thing on the top with a lighter color.",
    "So color pic from the fence just go a little brighter and.",
    "And maybe not every single one needs it, you know?",
    "But like a little highlight here and there.",
    "OK, I think I'm happy with that.",
    "There also is.",
    "Some kind of post in the middle which I've sort of ignored groups.",
    "Let's get that.",
    "So on a new layer will come like this do.",
    "And there is a lot to do in the scene, even with trying to keep it simple.",
    "Right, so little highlight.",
    "On the metal.",
    "Metallic area.",
    "Thank me by need to move the center over to the right a little bit.",
    "Doesn't feel quite centered.",
    "Alright, will merge that.",
    "OK.",
    "Next Area on the left.",
    "Let's get this fence finished up so there's a whole bunch area that's in shadow.",
    "We've got some cool and warm shadows here.",
    "It's going to be nice.",
    "You had the plans.",
    "Shadow underneath the.",
    "Plant holders Start to make some sense of this area.",
    "There's a little flower pot.",
    "Weather in.",
    "There's also some dappled light, some.",
    "Flashes of light and shadow from the tree, which we haven't painted yet.",
    "The highlights and shadows on the fence is so satisfying for some reason.",
    "Thank you, I'm glad that boat extra detail is worth it then.",
    "Thank you Pamela.",
    "Claire C.",
    "Come over here on the left there's.",
    "I think maybe it's the neighbors fence or something like a blue Gray color.",
    "Just the basic shape in there for that.",
    "There's also a bunch of little little garbage and recycling bins.",
    "I don't know if I'm going to paint those in or not I mean.",
    "I do feel like that kind of adds something.",
    "I don't know well, we're not going to focus on at first, that's for sure, but if we feel like something is missing at the end that we can consider it.",
    "Right, so if we're looking at this fence, an 3D mindset, then this side of the post?",
    "Yeah, we gotta figure out where the highlights and shadows are, which the sun is coming from the front aiming towards this house.",
    "So everything facing the front is kind of really bright like but on the left side of the post here we've got shadow.",
    "Little Shadow and then we have to look at the right side of this one is in Shadow and then there's a really intense light stopping right at the corner.",
    "Where is this image from Singapore from Singapore?",
    "Someone requested Singapore last week so I went looking.",
    "And this is what I found.",
    "Well, I found a bunch of different pictures but.",
    "I was searching on map crunch.",
    "Which.",
    "You know, grabs images from Google Street View.",
    "So it wasn't like just a whatever Google images found for Singapore.",
    "So there were a little bit more.",
    "Like residential things and stuff like that.",
    "Hey Donna, how are you?",
    "So there's a bunch of.",
    "Foliage and plants.",
    "Here I think it would help me to paint these in and then hopefully will happen.",
    "Is the fence is going to be easier to paint after that?",
    "Right now I'm just having a struggle where the background color is not as dark as it's going to be an it's kind of tough to judge.",
    "Right, we can maybe put some flower pots instead of the garbage bins.",
    "With a little more aesthetic.",
    "But sometimes fainting those details can be, you know, make a place look more like.",
    "People really live there, and that kind of thing.",
    "Yeah.",
    "So get the lasso tool.",
    "And I'm going to select.",
    "And hopes that didn't go too well.",
    "You know what?",
    "I'm just going to Freehand Lasso.",
    "Never mind.",
    "So I'm selecting the area that I want to paint within.",
    "And we're going to work on the shape of the posts, but I just want to work on the.",
    "The general.",
    "General area here.",
    "Oh, thank you.",
    "Thank you Pamela, I'm glad to hear that.",
    "That makes me happy.",
    "I hope you guys are having a good day.",
    "Appreciate the company.",
    "I'm going to try just painting these and see how they go.",
    "I was thinking about actually using the lasso tool to select individual like plants.",
    "These kind of look like.",
    "I don't know.",
    "They really big leaves.",
    "Let me zoom in.",
    "There's almost like banana leaves or like.",
    "Something like that.",
    "Yeah, that really cool.",
    "OK, So what I might do is take my brush and go to the shape dynamics and turn on pen pressure.",
    "So this will make it so that you can see what's happening.",
    "The difference is that my brush will be go to more of a point and then as I press down more it's going to get thicker so.",
    "Let's try that, maybe it'll help with painting these plants.",
    "So that way I can try to get more of the shape of them with one individual brush stroke so some of them we get like the little stem.",
    "Then the leaf.",
    "There's a lot of plants.",
    "There's a lot of leaves overlapping, So what I'm thinking is maybe I'll do like layer one of these darker ones, and then we'll add the highlights.",
    "The kid lock the transparency.",
    "And choose a lighter green and just kind of go over the leaf shapes already made.",
    "So that looks a little better.",
    "Especially when we zoom out, you gotta zoom out.",
    "Yeah, that's OK.",
    "We can.",
    "We can go somewhere with this idea.",
    "Thank you, Lena.",
    "I'm going to make a new layer underneath this and let's let's color pic from the window as a starting point and will go a little darker.",
    "And I'm going to use that color back there.",
    "And over here.",
    "So if you look at the references pretty dark all over here under the.",
    "The roof.",
    "And behind the plants.",
    "So we'll just put more will, put more leaves and for coming in front of this.",
    "Going to call it failed hard with this one.",
    "I'm posting the whole page so it's even smaller.",
    "Jackson, OK?",
    "Let's take a peek.",
    "I don't blame you like this.",
    "One is a workout.",
    "Oh.",
    "That's adorable guys.",
    "Check this out so these are Jackson Jokers Studies with us today.",
    "You did a really good work today.",
    "Nothing to feel bad about even this one.",
    "I don't.",
    "Maybe it's the foliage that's bugging you, but I think the House the bounce light in between these floors.",
    "That's one of my favorite things about the reference and I can get that turned out really well in your painting.",
    "Anyway, I hope you feel good about today overall, even if this, even if you don't really like this one.",
    "I like the Ibrox Pression.",
    "Oh yeah, yeah, I'm also getting.",
    "I have to admit, this one is like tiring me out how I don't know how long we've been working on this one, but it's been a challenge.",
    "Yeah, I agree Pamela, I agree.",
    "All right, we're going to keep going.",
    "We're going to keep going.",
    "So there's Oh, Oh, I just noticed like a big thing.",
    "OK, so this.",
    "The roof here.",
    "It actually goes up like that.",
    "This is lower OK.",
    "Can discoveries?",
    "I just didn't really pay attention to this earlier.",
    "Honestly, I think what I was doing with sketch I said something like, Oh, the tree will cover this so I don't have to pay attention to it.",
    "And now.",
    "I'm trying to figure things out.",
    "OK, so this is going to come down.",
    "A little bit.",
    "And then we can get some.",
    "Little.",
    "With little shadows to show the end of the tile roof, there we go.",
    "Yeah, that is something I totally missed.",
    "Alright, better, OK, we're getting there.",
    "Let's add a little bit more, a dappled light, some of these bright highlights are hitting the.",
    "Side here and upon the.",
    "The roof.",
    "And will paint another.",
    "Let's see if I can.",
    "Yeah, I can go to select reselect.",
    "That's handy.",
    "Don't have to select that again.",
    "And let's add some more plants so this time maybe we'll have the plants coming.",
    "In front of this other group, so will start to give a layering effect.",
    "Hi Muneer, how are you?",
    "Yeah, we got this big group and they reaching out.",
    "I mean if you look at the reference these plants, they come all the way in front of this window.",
    "So I gotta add a lot more.",
    "Let's select that again.",
    "Re select when we're going to add a whole bunch more.",
    "Over here.",
    "And we should be in good shape.",
    "More plans the better as far as I'm concerned.",
    "So I'd like to have some leaves going in different directions there for the most part, they're all kind of like going in One Direction mean they're pretty organized looking.",
    "Do we want to get a little bit of a lively feeling?",
    "I'm going to turn on color dynamics on my brush.",
    "See if that does anything interesting.",
    "Color dynamics should give some slight Hue variations.",
    "It's barely noticeable.",
    "I usually have my color dynamics settings really low.",
    "So that it looks natural but.",
    "Let's turn it up a little bit.",
    "Not happy with the last one, but overall I really enjoy painting along an Mattie.",
    "I'm loving how this one is turning out a bit different from the others but still really beautiful.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Yeah it is different from the others.",
    "A little bit less painterly and more.",
    "I don't know.",
    "It feels a bit more.",
    "Mega stylized review, where you put it?",
    "Happy you like it.",
    "I'm enjoying this one.",
    "I've been kind of working towards.",
    "I've been wanting to experiment with this kind of style for a while, at least at least In addition to other types of painting that I do.",
    "You know, I'm never going to.",
    "Want to feel like, Oh I can only paint one way.",
    "I really like trying new things and new workflows.",
    "But I see.",
    "There's been a lot of more stylized art that's inspired me a ton over these last couple years, especially recently.",
    "And it's nice to try.",
    "Try it out.",
    "And feel like somethings working 'cause I had a lot of attempts.",
    "At doing this kind of work on various streams.",
    "Feel like it's finally starting to.",
    "Get a little bit more natural for me.",
    "Alright, well I have to add another fence which I'm not super excited about.",
    "But here we go.",
    "I'm going to color pic from the fence I already have here on the right.",
    "And yeah, we use the same size brush and we should be able to do this.",
    "Not too much trouble.",
    "I'll turn off color dynamics again and we'll just go 12.",
    "3 four OK, I guess it wasn't too bad.",
    "Ann Maybe I'll just duplicate this.",
    "Make sure it's exactly the same.",
    "Poop.",
    "Really thank you.",
    "Yeah, I like the texture too.",
    "It's been a little bit of I feel like I've had to use some discipline to stop from switching brushes, brushes, 'cause I usually like to use a few throughout the painting.",
    "But it's help.",
    "Things feel more consistent to stick with one.",
    "Ha feel like I've walked by this house in South Florida in Miami.",
    "You know, it's interesting.",
    "You say that because when I was looking for references so this the reference is actually in Singapore and somebody requested last week to do a place in Singapore.",
    "So I was looking for that an when I was going through on the Google Street View Thing.",
    "I was really surprised because I you know, if anybody doesn't know, I kind of grew up in South Florida.",
    "I spent a lot of years living there and it reminded me there was a lot of houses with like tile roofs and just kind of similar architecture and some similar plants and things.",
    "So I yeah, I thought I kind of had the same feeling which is funny, like of course there's a lot of differences too.",
    "But I noticed some similarities that surprise me.",
    "So bitter about more fences haha right like come on, I'm done with the fences.",
    "Almost though almost we're going to add a little highlight to this.",
    "Also dispense also be somewhere.",
    "Needs a little bit of light hitting.",
    "I think this is one of my favourites.",
    "The depth of the floors is drawing me right in.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Oh",
    "OK, I'm going to lock that layer and maybe I went a little overboard with the highlights.",
    "I don't know.",
    "Will go over some of those that.",
    "The shadows are also clear.",
    "OK, so God Fences.",
    "And we need to bring this wall up now so that this makes this is nice and flat.",
    "There shouldn't be that much space.",
    "And then.",
    "The bright white lights I'm going to color pic from the reference 'cause I'm very curious what that color is of the wall in the shadow had how far to?",
    "Oh, it's actually not that bad.",
    "I was curious if my value was really off.",
    "It's actually not that bad.",
    "OK.",
    "It just felt wrong.",
    "For some reason.",
    "I wasn't sure if this shadow was right, but maybe we can just work on the transition between the highlight in the shadow.",
    "Maybe that'll help.",
    "Matt is on the fence about more fences, basically.",
    "A Spanish common in South Florida?",
    "Yes, yes.",
    "A lot of people speak Spanish there well, there's a lot of people from Spanish speaking countries that live in Florida.",
    "And so.",
    "Then They have that background and no speak Spanish and a lot of people because of that.",
    "Also want to study Spanish because it's a good thing to know in that in that area.",
    "So yes.",
    "Offense Madness.",
    "OK, so a little bit of a darker.",
    "Shadow underneath the.",
    "So this comes down this matches up here.",
    "Alright, I'm excited to get these little.",
    "Planters.",
    "So full of plants.",
    "It's going to be really cute, I think.",
    "Ah, I just notice something.",
    "So I can bring this fence a little bit further over.",
    "On top of that.",
    "That will help.",
    "Hopefully with the depth.",
    "And then.",
    "Yeah, let's start with the plants.",
    "So I think my sketch layer has.",
    "Yeah, you can see that things have moved a bit from where I sketch them in.",
    "But we did have a little planters like that.",
    "So.",
    "Make a new layer and.",
    "Color do we want this?",
    "Is going to be really cool because the plants are just like my favorite kind of effect.",
    "The plants are partially in Shadow and partially in highlight, so I'm going to right now.",
    "I'm going to only focus on the shape of the plants first.",
    "I'm not going to worry about the.",
    "The color, I mean, I'm just gonna pick a random green.",
    "And one thing that I think is so cute about these planters in the front is how like puffy and rounded.",
    "And just like.",
    "I don't know.",
    "I like how the plants look in the front.",
    "It's very cute, so we're going to get the shape first like this.",
    "And then will work on the colors.",
    "Sometimes it's easier to do that in steps.",
    "And there actually.",
    "So the planters are close together and pretty full, so there just meeting together with the plants are meeting together in the centre.",
    "OK, so now we can take the lock the transparency up here I'm going to flip.",
    "And we can go with a more like green blue color.",
    "Go darker.",
    "Yeah, over here it's going to be in shadow with a more of a green blue and then on the right were going to get into like a yellow warm yellow.",
    "Then we can have a little bit of a transition there, but the sunlight I really makes the sunlight look nice.",
    "Oh, thanks for hanging out with us Michael and thanks for the tips and stuff.",
    "Enjoy the rest of your day.",
    "And we can add some little little leaves.",
    "Little highlights.",
    "I like to add these blue green highlights.",
    "A little bit of texture like this.",
    "And then we can.",
    "Add some later highlights and we get into the Sunnyside.",
    "The more yellow highlights.",
    "Pretty cool.",
    "And maybe we can have some.",
    "I'll turn off the air, turn on the shape dynamics again.",
    "And we'll go little bit more of a pointy tip, and then we can add some little spikes.",
    "'cause these plants look kind of spiky.",
    "This one has a nice book feeling for some reason.",
    "I can also see a girl with a person walking down the street in a similar style.",
    "Maybe I should try to add that in.",
    "I don't know if well.",
    "Well, I know.",
    "I certainly won't be able to do it during this stream 'cause we're kind of nearing the end, but.",
    "Maybe maybe I can experiment with that a little bit.",
    "Thank you.",
    "So on a layer below that, I do feel like even the white color picked from the reference.",
    "It just feels like this needs to be darker over here.",
    "I don't know what that is.",
    "About But I'm going to darken this a little bit.",
    "Yeah, there's some areas that can use a little bit of cleanup.",
    "Little bit of polishing.",
    "Surround the windows with those hard edges.",
    "We could sort of.",
    "Go over those with something more textured.",
    "That was the area I use the lasso tool for and I think it stands out a little bit.",
    "There's some little details on the outside of the door.",
    "Congratz Oh my gosh.",
    "Well.",
    "Congrats.",
    "I hope you're going to.",
    "Get a good rest.",
    "After that.",
    "I could actually raise out some of what I just did there.",
    "This is why I like to work on a separate.",
    "Um layer and kind of check.",
    "Check my work before emerged.",
    "Sometimes I find that I took something in that direction.",
    "I don't really like.",
    "I like to be able to erase out before I commit, so I'll usually work on a separate layer.",
    "For awhile and then turn the later on and off.",
    "See how it looks and then merge down from happy with it.",
    "It gives me a little chance to fix stuff.",
    "Hey Andy, how's it going?",
    "For anyone just coming in, we've been doing studies today at this third one I think is going to be the last one, 'cause there's still a bit left to do on it, but this is what we did for the day so far.",
    "This one was really fun.",
    "Oh, at the beginning it wasn't, but it ended up being really fun.",
    "And yeah, this is one we're doing right now.",
    "Ah.",
    "Right, I'm glad we could be with you to the end there.",
    "Oh yeah, we have another fence.",
    "My gosh I forgot the neighbor.",
    "The neighbor has offense, OK?",
    "OK guys.",
    "Let's do this.",
    "So we're going to make a new layer.",
    "It's a different kind of fence, though not.",
    "The same style.",
    "But we're going to try similar approach.",
    "So this is a black fence.",
    "Metal.",
    "And it's got a little bit of a fancy design.",
    "So something like this, it goes off the side of the screen.",
    "This is on a separate layer so I can erase away and fix things.",
    "Thanks.",
    "I hope you're having a good day so far, Andy.",
    "So there's an interesting.",
    "I don't know about this design if we're going to get it exactly, but I'm just going to wing it so it seems like something it goes straight and then has little curve at the bottom.",
    "Wish I could maybe make one of these and duplicated that might be smart.",
    "Thank you Ryan.",
    "I appreciate it.",
    "Take care, talk to you soon.",
    "Do you have an Instagram account?",
    "Yes, actually thank you, Ella.",
    "It's I think the link is below.",
    "In the description, yeah, it should be there.",
    "If it's not showing up or anything, just let me know and I'll post it in the chat.",
    "But thanks for asking.",
    "Alright, I'm going to duplicate that one layer that I made and we're just going to use that.",
    "'cause I think that that would be way more accurate than me trying to draw the same curve at this over and over again.",
    "That's not going to happen.",
    "And maybe it will look.",
    "Charming.",
    "You know, sometimes it works when you.",
    "Mistakes, sometimes it can work.",
    "I do think maybe I should have duplicated it to be a little bit thicker.",
    "Alright, will merge all the.",
    "Details.",
    "Yeah, yeah, I can actually, I don't know that he does.",
    "He occasionally would stream on Twitch awhile back doing some UI design stuff.",
    "Things design things.",
    "But it's been awhile.",
    "So I don't have like any accounts.",
    "He doesn't have any accounts where he shares that stuff.",
    "If that changes all, I'll let you know.",
    "OK, so this is a little tedious, but here we go.",
    "We got our pattern.",
    "I think that was probably the better way to do it.",
    "For the sake of this matching properly.",
    "Alright, so I'm going to duplicate that and go to edit transform, flip horizontal so that we get that overlap design.",
    "That you see in the reference.",
    "Only I missed a couple on the side.",
    "Duplicate that edit transform, flip horizontal.",
    "Alright, cool.",
    "Yeah, of course I I got it.",
    "OK.",
    "Oh thanks project.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Appreciate it.",
    "Yeah, project project avoid posted my Instagram and chat.",
    "Thank you pastor.",
    "I'm happy that you feel the Sunny Vibes are coming through with this one.",
    "Alright, I want to erase out a little bit where these lines went above the fence.",
    "Alright, well we've got our fence.",
    "About too much drama.",
    "Oh, thank you John, thanks for being here.",
    "OK, so there's a few more things we need to do to get this feeling feeling finished.",
    "We're missing the tree, so the tree we gotta get the tree in an then.",
    "Uh.",
    "Well, that's the main thing.",
    "There's also I honestly don't know what this is over here.",
    "I don't know if it's like a mailbox or something, but there's something over here.",
    "We can kind of just put in the colour, there's like a Gray metallic thing here.",
    "We don't need to understand it, we just need to paint it.",
    "Alright, so we painted the thing we can come back to that later and like maybe.",
    "Do something else with it.",
    "But at least it's not orange.",
    "And.",
    "Match that down.",
    "Let's think about this tree on the left.",
    "So I will work on the branches 1st and I'm just going from the reference an roughly putting the branches where I think they should be.",
    "And we can make some decisions to if we think something is going to look better, we can change things up.",
    "I like to paint in an erase out when it comes to tree branches.",
    "Sometimes I find it hard to make natural looking tree branches.",
    "I don't know why but.",
    "It helps me to make a paint stroke and then use the eraser to erase part of it away and then it starts giving getting that a less perfect 'cause it when you're using a brush.",
    "It has like that perfect gradual thickness and when you erase away then you start getting some more of the natural randomness to the thickness of the branch.",
    "So I really like that.",
    "Oh, thank you I came, that's really sweet.",
    "I'm crazy.",
    "Basically.",
    "OK, so let's bring a couple of branches down here.",
    "And the reaching out.",
    "I'm not going to paint all of the branches in the reference.",
    "I think that would be a bit busy anyway.",
    "But just get some basic ones in.",
    "Honestly, that starts to look a little bit better, even with just the branches.",
    "Even without leaves, that's really helping.",
    "The area needed needed this tree.",
    "Fig tree.",
    "Try to get some branches going in different directions and not just in the same direction.",
    "Again, trying to fight my natural urge to.",
    "Make the same shapes over and over again.",
    "Keep it natural.",
    "OK, so we'll have that be the start of our tree.",
    "And then I'll make a new layer.",
    "Now this might be where I finally have to depart from this brush.",
    "I've been using the same brush for the whole painting, which is works pretty well, but these these leaves on this tree are.",
    "They've got interesting shape and they've got some sharp angles, so maybe I'll just start with it and see how it goes, but we might end up working with a little bit of a different shape brush.",
    "I think it's a door so they don't have to open the big gates all the time.",
    "Oh, that would make sense.",
    "Wow, my perception of scale is really weird.",
    "I didn't imagine that it was something you could actually walk through, but but it could be.",
    "That's cool.",
    "Looking at map French, it's a bit confusing.",
    "How does it work and how do you navigate the site?",
    "Oh, let me show you, I'll do like a quick demo.",
    "I'll do a quick demo 'cause I've learned a lot overtime about how to use it.",
    "OK, so.",
    "If you go to the view of the day is really nice today there's always a view of the day.",
    "OK, so when you go to the website?",
    "Oops.",
    "Um?",
    "If you click go so this is map crunch for anybody like what are we looking at.",
    "This website randomizes Google Street View images so it's good for finding random locations to paint.",
    "If you're wanting to do virtual Plein Air Painting so when you press go, you'll get a random place like in the world, so it could be anywhere and sometimes look at that.",
    "That's really pretty.",
    "I like this one.",
    "Yeah, you'll get sometimes it'll be like on the side of the road and sometimes it's nicer than others.",
    "You know, sometimes there are low res and you don't know what you're going to get, but you can also.",
    "You can go to the options and you can select a specific country if you want a certain look like if you want like tropical or feeling, or you know whatever country here you're looking for geography press, go and then you'll get an area in that specific country.",
    "You can also click the map here and then you can drag and drop this little person and then you'll get you'll end up in that area where ever you drop so you can find maybe specific areas that you want to paint and then you can go there and find something there.",
    "So all different kinds of stuff.",
    "And that's basically how I use it.",
    "There's some other things you can do down here when you when you're at the map, and I think the list has it too.",
    "Yeah, these settings down here you can select if you want like urban areas, indoor areas.",
    "Or if you want it to go on auto and that will make a slideshow for you and you can say how many seconds and it'll like automatically switch to a new location.",
    "So yeah, if you are looking for a cool places on there.",
    "Like I said earlier, if you use the map, you're more likely to find specific places that you might like want.",
    "You might want to paint if you just click go then you can get a lot of the side of the road but just still fun.",
    "It's kind of treasure hunt, but if you want to join my discord, if anybody is interested, you can.",
    "Click the link.",
    "I'll put it in the chat.",
    "We have a channel in my discord called virtual plein air, and we're always posting pretty places that we find on map crunch in there.",
    "So if you are like feeling like you're spending a lot of time not finding anything good.",
    "If you want to skip through that part of the process, you can just join our discord and search through that area like I can show you real quick.",
    "Please just ignore all my notifications and stuff, but in the discord you can just scroll back up.",
    "There's a lot of me and a lot of others in the community, like to post cool places we find with nice lighting or good composition or interesting places, and you can scroll up through these forever.",
    "It is a lot so.",
    "If you would rather do that than just aimlessly searching, there's some good ones here.",
    "We're always posting new ones.",
    "Yeah, you're welcome.",
    "I know what you mean.",
    "'cause when I first started looking for references there, I was also like how are people finding good stuff?",
    "How is that happening?",
    "But yeah, that's how.",
    "That's how.",
    "Alright, so.",
    "That's also true sieve.",
    "Yeah, you can if you want to look for for actual photos.",
    "The thing is with map crunch is a lot of times the camera view because of the Google Street View car.",
    "The 360, the way that it takes the photos.",
    "It creates a lot of distortion with.",
    "Like sort of fish.",
    "I kind of looked.",
    "I personally don't mind it, and I've gotten used to it.",
    "But Some people really don't like that, so you can always go to other sources for photos, but I like the map crunch because I like the first of all.",
    "I like that there's like literally endless.",
    "I mean, well, I guess I shouldn't say Endless 'cause there is.",
    "There is a finite amount of photos there, but I mean it's the whole world.",
    "There is so much you're not going to run out of things to paint.",
    "And also it's good for expanding your visual library because there's you know architecture and geography from around the whole world and you might find things that you didn't know what interests you, so there's a lot of regions that I've come to appreciate more because of doing these.",
    "You know which is randomly ending up in an area and being like, wow, this is really pretty.",
    "Where is this?",
    "You know there's certain places that I've come to appreciate more because of that.",
    "I didn't really know what they look like before.",
    "So it's definitely some benefits to doing it.",
    "I'm not sure if I like this.",
    "Method for the tree.",
    "Yet I'm going to.",
    "And I'm going to keep going.",
    "Still will decide.",
    "Oh cool, yeah, you should be able to find some good stuff like that, and I know what you mean.",
    "I I also live really far away from my original.",
    "My original home and sometimes I like to go through there and look at pictures and places to paint and stuff like that.",
    "You know the feeling.",
    "So right now I'm painting the darker sort of background.",
    "Leaves that are in Shadow and then we're going to paint a lighter group.",
    "Groups of leaves that are getting hit by light.",
    "So by starting with the darker ones then we have some room to go lighter and give the idea of depth hopefully.",
    "Hopefully.",
    "Have an idea?",
    "I don't know if this is going to work.",
    "But I'm going to make a selection and then try to make a brushstroke.",
    "Yeah, that might work if you look at the shape of.",
    "These leaves are very interesting.",
    "I might be able to use the selection tool to make it possible for me to stick with this brush.",
    "I'm really trying to stick with this one brush.",
    "By Jackson.",
    "Thank you for painting with me.",
    "Thanks for hanging out.",
    "Yeah, this one is going to something else.",
    "Yeah, this could work though.",
    "Alright, I'm going to try it in a few other places, so I'm going to make a bunch of these little Piney selections.",
    "Make my brush stroke within that shape.",
    "Do that down here.",
    "And then whatever you want.",
    "Also, it's kind of fun.",
    "Yeah, there's a tree finally.",
    "Finally.",
    "OK.",
    "So.",
    "Let's make a new layer.",
    "I will start with some lighter greens.",
    "There really bright, actually.",
    "There's a lot of yellow.",
    "That looks good.",
    "So.",
    "My concern is this.",
    "I might have to do a lot of.",
    "Stuff like what I was just doing.",
    "OK, here's what we're going to do.",
    "We're going to step one, which is a little bit closer to this color.",
    "And let's create a little bit of a glow.",
    "Then we'll go with some really bright.",
    "Individual leaf shaped things.",
    "The idea.",
    "OK, it looks messy.",
    "Will see if it works.",
    "So now we make a new layer or we go even brighter and a little bit more yellow.",
    "So this should really stand out.",
    "And now we're going to focus on individual leaf shapes and the way it looks like this plant is.",
    "This tree is working is like there's a central area and then coming out from that.",
    "So let's try that.",
    "By Claire Z.",
    "Thank you for hanging out.",
    "I know I actually got to go to.",
    "This is going a little longer than I planned, so I'm going to try my best to get this tree finish up with the tree real quick and then.",
    "I got around here.",
    "But I enjoyed the enjoy the stream in the company today, you guys.",
    "I will be posting this.",
    "Probably here on Behance so I post a lot of what I do on Instagram and also on behalf, but I kind of try to save my better stuff for be hands so I don't post every single thing here.",
    "But you can always, uh, yeah there's a link to my Instagram below the stream in the description.",
    "And that's where you'll see a lot of my studies.",
    "Even some of the more the less polished ones.",
    "But I really like this one.",
    "I think it has potential, so I'll probably Polish it up a little bit more.",
    "Post stream.",
    "Maybe on another day when I have more time, but I wanted to show at least the end of the process of this tree.",
    "what I was going to try to do and I do like this enough.",
    "What I'm doing here with the tree that I think is worth it.",
    "It's a little bit time consuming compared to maybe taking, uh?",
    "Some kind of leaf brush and going in here, but hopefully it'll be worth it.",
    "So using the lasso tool to get a hard edge on top and then letting the brush randomly.",
    "Just end where ends on the bottom, so you get that nice sort of natural jagged edge like the leaves.",
    "We can try also just kind of painting it in with a smaller brush that might be faster even.",
    "So making a line and then.",
    "Yeah.",
    "This is a very busy tree, so something I notice leaves will have a couple different.",
    "By project thank you.",
    "Have a good rest of your day.",
    "When you're painting leaves, you guys, there's a couple of different effects that will happen.",
    "Sometimes you'll get light shining through the leaf and sometimes light shining off the leaf.",
    "So normally what I noticed is when there's light shining through the leaf, you get that beautiful like subsurface scattering effect, and the leaf will be really vibrant and like Super Green.",
    "It depends on the plant, but it would be very very saturated yellow, green and then sometimes.",
    "Um?",
    "Find Rainier.",
    "Sometimes you'll get light shining off, like reflecting off the leaves, and that will.",
    "That'll be more of a white light.",
    "So yeah, I'm not choosing colors for the.",
    "For the leaves here, it's going to be vibrant, saturated green for light shining through and then a couple areas will go with bright white light shining off the leaves.",
    "So.",
    "Alright, well I am sorry that I didn't get to finish this one.",
    "I have to admit I knew this one was a little ambitious from the start, but I thought we could do it and it ended up taking a long time because of the details and the architecture so I should probably practice at more of these scenes.",
    "Hopefully you guys don't hate them because we can do somewhere together, but will still keep doing natural scenes and other things.",
    "Maybe will do some portraits in the future too, so we'll keep trying to mix it up, but I think I'm like about out of time, so sadly I won't be able to get this to 100% of a finished state during stream today, but I'll try to finish it up soon and post it and share it, but most of what's happening from here to the end is going to be polishing, so spending a lot of time probably making leave shapes.",
    "And then going through and cleaning up little areas.",
    "And maybe maybe maybe tweaking some things.",
    "But it is close.",
    "We got most of it done.",
    "Got most of it done.",
    "I hope you guys enjoy the process.",
    "I really appreciate the company today and all the tips.",
    "I got some good.",
    "I learned a couple new shortcuts today so thank you.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Yeah, and these were our paintings for the day, so thank you for joining me, you guys.",
    "I appreciate it.",
    "Oh, thank you Ella.",
    "I will be back here every Wednesday.",
    "I might be able to sneak in some extra streams on other days if possible, but I'll definitely be here on Wednesdays an yeah if you guys want to share it.",
    "If anybody was painting along on the stream today and you didn't get a chance to share in the chat or you're still working on your painting, you're welcome to post it on social media and tag me.",
    "I would love to see it.",
    "Or you can post it in my discord.",
    "There's a link to my discord in the description below.",
    "And I think that's it.",
    "I don't know if I had any other announcements other than thank you guys are great.",
    "I hope you have a good rest of the day.",
    "Take care of yourselves.",
    "Thank you clever.",
    "Thank you Pamela.",
    "Thank you very much.",
    "Thanks for the nice comments of the company.",
    "You guys, I will see you next time.",
    "And yeah, enjoy the rest of your day.",
    "Thanks for hanging out.",
    "Love to see you do some portraits.",
    "This has been lovely.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Oh thank you.",
    "OK, that's good feedback.",
    "I will keep it in mind.",
    "I'll keep it in mind.",
