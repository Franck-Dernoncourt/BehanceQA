    "Back then, with practical practical effects and whatnot, I think budget I don't know.",
    "Maybe it was the less and less of a thing, so they have to use their imagination more and also like not a lot of ideas for used yet, so like a lot of the cool stuff from the 80s like you'll see.",
    "Homages homage outages of that in, like the modern in modern filmmaking.",
    "But back then, like they just thought of the stupidest things and you know, they made into a movie shopping mall.",
    "Two robots that were programmed to be security guards malfunction an end up trying to kill people.",
    "That's the stupidest idea in the world.",
    "Edge over works right and play come on.",
    "Now the Eric, can you get a great campy horror the followed by a bukakke with a machine gun?",
    "Yeah, and it worked.",
    "It all worked.",

    "What's it called like?",
    "A beefy guy with a rocket launcher like going to rescue his daughter?",
    "As commando.",
    "Sly Stallone just you just give Sly Stallone a garden and give him an odd title and its new movie.",
    "Right?",

    "Over the time I know.",
    "Someone on my Twitter feed.",
    "I don't know how this is not repeated yet the last starfighter.",
    "How is this not rebooted?",
    "Like that's the that's the most.",
    "That's the movie that could literally be made today and it would work still.",
    "Especially nowadays, without video, games are like 2 that such assumption novel idea.",
    "I love that movie last starfighter.",
    "And then like the main theme song of that movie, they used it for movies because that movie never took off and I was like why did this movie take off?",
    "It's so good.",
    "I was thinking about this alright, so back in the 80s right?",
    "Everything was so campy and everything was so you know, like they tried to.",
    "OK, so before Avengers 'cause I want you know, like since we're all at home, everyone's watching marathons and things like that watching Star Wars Marathon.",

    "They made an Avengers movie.",
    "Way back in the day, they've made Spiderman movies.",
    "You know, with Sam Raimi and all this other stuff.",
    "They did work.",
    "Fight they never clicked I think is they asked to do with audience so vacuum and they the original movie like if you seen bits and parts of it.",
    "It's a very campy.",
    "It's very 80s.",
    "Right?",
    "It has David Hasselhoff in it as as Nick Fury, it's kind of weird.",
    "The people that watch those movies back then grew up to become the people that make them now.",
    "So I think because the people that made the movies back then.",
    "They grew up with super campy like Buck Rogers and flash Gordon.",
    "You know, Super Old Star Trek where it was.",
    "Super Duper campy.",
    "So it's like it's a gradual progression of people kind of understanding things.",
    "What works, what doesn't work, so that's Why.",
    "Marvel movies today seemed like they would happen in real life.",
    "Pain.",
    "And in this modern setting, right?",
    "You see the same thing all the time.",
    "Yeah, it's about the audience about the audience that watched previously.",
    "Growing up, giving him being given the resources to make the things that you know they envision now.",
    "So that's why it looks cool.",
    "And it looks like modernized in a sense, right?",
    "I think Star Wars were one of the main kind of turning points and moving making because it made.",
    "Like sci-fi Sort of real.",
    "Yeah, I know there there was Star Trek prior to Star Wars right about.",
    "Star Trek is very streamlined.",
    "Everything was very elegant.",
    "Innocence, everyone is very proper.",
    "In Star Wars, who is more gritty is more real.",
    "Like if you look at the nex wearing and like any hope you see things like little components and stuff sticking out.",
    "You know it's like rough edges is like oh complicated and you know there's rust on it and Whatnot.",
    "Everything before Star Wars is very like.",
    "You know, like it was sort of moulded right and like clean and also there's nowhere or Whatnot.",
    "Same with cartoons.",
    "I feel like New Animations are probably not that resemble, but I wanted to see growing up and carry the same tone that was watching siding workers.",
    "Yeah, if we.",
    "Either way, I don't think I can go back to watching 80s cartoons.",
    "I grew up with babies cartoons.",
    "Like if I went back and watched, let's say, teenage meet Ninja Turtles.",
    "Back send me watching it.",
    "I thought it was the coolest, most thing in the world, but being exposed to so many things that has been growing up.",
    "Action movies anime, like all this other stuff I kind of like more real like.",
    "Grounded alot of the way that I think about how sci-fi should be.",
    "I go back and watch teenage Ninja Ninja Turtles now.",
    "I might do this is like this is kid craft.",
    "This is like corny kids stuff.",
    "It still cool for nostalgia sake, but it's like the jokes like I don't know it just not I wouldn't necessarily work right.",
    "That's why I enjoyed the reboot of team and T.",
    "People didn't.",

    "Especially Part 2, Part 2 of the teenage meet ninja turtle like reboot and that was great.",
    "Bebop rocksteady.",
    "They left they look small on Oman.",
    "Oh yeah, the original cartoons are very dumb.",
    "Even that, ask things like Gargoyles Gargoyles.",
    "If you watch the beginning season like you have the tone of seriousness 'cause it was trying to copy.",
    "Make you know Batman the animated series even that show.",
    "Son of Batman animated series is campy AF.",
    "Like we don't remember these things because we remember like the cool intro and all this other stuff, but it's a lot of the cartoons back.",
    "If they were campy and it's just like cringe worthy.",
    "And the people that watched it back then grow up.",
    "To make you know the Joker, right?",
    "Hey girl, Suicide Squad and things like that.",
    "Going back to things you thought was amazing and realize it's basically over is so sad is I don't.",
    "It's not sad.",
    "I would say I don't know if I would use the word sad.",

    "Most people hated it but I thought they did a great job and did the turtles justice.",
    "Oh wait, the new the new reboot cartoon.",
    "I'm sure I think like if I watched.",
    "I haven't watched any of it, but I have this feeling that reboots of things from old from the older show.",
    "Would it be as campy?",
    "It would still have a flair to it, because like it's modernized and nowadays like cartoons, course hands up there, not necessarily for kids anymore.",
    "I think it's just another extension of entertainment.",
    "I give you look at, you know the phenomenons of quote quote cards here in Steven Universe.",
    "Or like My Little Pony, you know things like that that were meant for kids.",
    "But then it's like, Oh wait, they're actually catering to an older audience as well.",
