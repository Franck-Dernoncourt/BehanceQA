    "So you just start typing.",
    "I want to change that to the graduate.",
    "Start now that I've typed that text photo shop doesn't know that I'm done so.",
    "Sitting there with a flashing cursor 'cause I could maybe change my mind.",
    "I could add more.",
    "I could use my cursor keys to go back and forth.",
    "That's the left and right arrow keys to kind of change things or fix things, but it's right now saying for the most part.",
    "That it will even Janelle.",
    "I will answer that question too.",
    "For the most part, Photoshop doesn't know I'm done until I tell it I'm done.",
    "So How do I tell it I'm done?",
    "Well in Photoshop.",
    "One of two ways.",
    "You can either go up here to this little check mark and just say, hey, I'm done.",
    "I'm done typing for now.",
    "Or you can now in photo shop.",
    "Click away from the text and that will also mark it as complete, meaning you're done.",
    "You can always go back and edit it and always go back and change it.",
    "You can always go back and do anything you want.",
    "But while your until you do one of those two things, it's going to not do anything else until you do one of those things.",
    "Go sit there flashing OK.",
    "So now in photo shop that's created a layer.",
    "It already names the layer the same thing you just typed.",
    "You can freely move that layer around.",
    "You could always come back to that type and change it.",
    "You can delete it.",
    "You can delete the layer.",
    "You can do lots of things in Photoshop with the type I wanted to move it around.",
    "I don't use the type tool unless I'm going to edit the type, so anything else I want to do.",
    "I would do with the other tool, so if I want to move it, I'd use the move tool and I can pick it up and put it anywhere that I want.",
    "So if I wanted to put it right here, now that X is right there now, why is the text white?",
    "Because Photoshop remembers the last color you used.",
    "So from that standpoint it the last color I type something in Photoshop, I changed it to white, so I started up today.",
    "Clicked type tool.",
    "Lo and Behold, is white because that was the last color I used in Photoshop.",
    "In other applications that will not be the case in usually and in design.",
    "For example, the type will come in black by default until you change it each time.",
    "Now you can change your defaults to be a specific color, but it does not remember the last color used like Photoshop Dose Alright.",
    "So now, how would that process be different in, let's say in design?",
    "So let's switch over to in design.",
    "Let some I'm going to open up this document because maybe I'm not going to open up that document.",
    "Yeah, I'm going to open up the document because there's something I want to talk about in a specific document, but if I wanted to add some more text to this document, I want to put the graduate right here in design as a type tool, just like photo shop does.",
    "But the differences within design the type has to be in a frame, so you have to have a an area that you've designated for the type to go into so.",
    "Most frustrating then design uses.",
    "You gotta click and you start typing and nothing happens because just clicking doesn't do anything until you draw the frame first.",
    "So if I click and drag.",
    "To make a frame then I can type the graduate.",
    "And very small black type.",
    "There it is, and if we zoom in on that real quick we can see it.",
    "It's there.",
    "So the type is there and I can now and again it still flashing the cursor waiting for me to do something else and same thing if I click off of it or click away from it with any tool it will know that I'm finished typing.",
    "Now I can also say well that time is really too small.",
    "We can barely see it.",
    "I can select all that type, I just hit command on the keyboard, PC control A and then I can go and choose a size so the person that asked about points in Pikus.",
    "Points are what type is measured in, so that's why it says eight points.",
    "Picas are a different measurement system, just like inches, in centimeters, and all of them are different scales of measurement.",
    "There's a point scale in measurement as well.",
    "Pixel scale of measurement, so they're all different.",
    "Other than them being different, I can't really tell you ones better or more of advantageous thing.",
    "The other is just that type is always been, traditionally or or sized by points.",
    "So if I said.",
    "Oh, that's a point.",
    "That's why that's so small.",
    "If I want to make that bigger, I can just simply come down here and choose a bigger size.",
    "Now keep in mind.",
    "If I choose the sizes too big in Indesign bit meaning meaning bigger than the box I drew the frame I drew, then I'm not going to see all of the text, so I made it 24 point.",
    "Now I just see the because the graduate won't fit in that frame anymore.",
    "So if I come back to the type tool, or I'm sorry the selection tool and I make the frame bigger now we can see the graduate again.",
    "We can see the text that I just typed.",
    "Let's put in an area where we actually see it.",
    "Alright so?",
    "That is how it kind of works in a nutshell, in in design, and we're going to get into more type essentials, but I just wanted to show you the difference in creating the type in the 1st Place.",
    "Alright, let's go over illustrator.",
    "Then let's open up this drawing I did in illustrator many moons ago of a car, so I actually drew this with shapes just to show people how to Draw Something with shapes.",
    "Same thing illustrators more like photo shop in that when I click the type or the type tool and I click somewhere it puts in that same sample type.",
    "I don't have to draw frame first in design is the only one that you have to draw frame 1st and I can say the car for example.",
    "And again it still flashing still waiting for me 'cause it doesn't know that I'm finished typing.",
    "Until I click away from it or click it and then it gives me the actual type now.",
    "In Photoshop, Illustrator is very easy to size, type either with the points like we did so I can come back to this.",
    "Triple Click to get my all my type selected.",
    "I can see over here that that's 12 points and I could change it to something bigger so I can make it 24 and I could see it as I'm doing it 48 points, so that would be 48 points, but in Photoshop and illustrator is also easy to size it as an object.",
    "So if I grab the selection tool or in Photoshop, the free transform and move tools I can just scale it and just say hey I'm going to make this type bigger now you see it is letting me stretch it.",
    "And even if I were to stretch, it is not going to distort the type from a quality standpoint, it will distort it visually because type, even though I did all those weird things to it, it knew what I did.",
    "Look it made it 171 points.",
    "It changed the letting and it would change the horizontal and vertical scale.",
    "So even though I'm distorting it with a selection tool, it knows it's actually specking out.",
    "The type that I've just distorted it too.",
    "Now let's undo that.",
    "And let's say I did want to keep the type.",
    "Without distorting, I just want to make it bigger.",
    "Well, in illustrator at least, you'd hold on your shift key and that would make it bigger, bigger point size.",
    "But it would not distort the type.",
    "OK, so if we go back to photo shop.",
    "We want to do that same thing.",
    "Well, we have that layer select it.",
    "I would go to free transform.",
    "Which is.",
    "Actually it's under edit, I believe free transform so command T which is the way I always do it.",
    "That's why I was looking for the menu option command T that would give me that same kind of box to move it around with or size it and photo shops.",
    "New default is you don't have to hold down the shift key, so let's just let me scale it bigger or smaller anyway that I want and again it will spec out the new sizes of those point size of that type.",
    "Now if I did want to distort it I can do it the same way, but I would hold down the shift key.",
    "Should distort it and change it and flip it around and do all kinds of crazy things with it.",
    "If I wanted to do it that way.",
    "And of course if I changed my mind I can do this Cape to put it back to the way it was and then start over again so I don't screw up the proportions of it.",
    "And again if I don't hold down the shift key it will just do a proportionally so those are some of the essentials of How do I start putting type in these applications?",
    "How do I size the type and move it around?",
    "Each one works kind of the same way if we want to move the Indesign type around, same thing.",
    "We would use the selection tool.",
    "To do that, we move the frame around.",
    "We put it on the page, or off the worst.",
    "Couldn't see it off the page.",
    "There we go.",
    "We move the frame around.",
    "We put it wherever we want.",
    "Now that pink highlighting and in design is an in design feature, it's letting me know that whatever font this is in, I don't have that font currently active so I can go ahead and change it to a font that I do have active.",
    "Like that Frank.",
    "OK, so now that pink will go away because it says, oh, you do have that font.",
    "You can use that font.",
    "Alright, so let's talk about.",
    "Some of the other characteristics of working with type in the various applications, so let's go back to photo shop.",
    "Now let's talk about the type panel, where you will do most of your operations.",
    "Let's go over each one.",
    "Now there was a question that was asked.",
    "I saw earlier about X40.",
    "Hey, exporting an image out with type.",
    "How do I keep the type great quality no matter what?",
    "Well, it exporting whether it's Photoshop, illustrator or Indesign will depend on the format that you exported out too.",
    "So for example, if I were to export this image out as a low resolution JPEG.",
    "For example, common format JPEG.",
    "We use it all the time we use it on social media.",
    "Then the type will then become whatever the resolution of the image is.",
    "So if I say 72 pixels per inch, small size easy to upload everywhere then my my text also becomes 72 DPI or PPI and it also becomes as low resolution is that image so it will not look as good as it does as vector type.",
    "So to answer your question, what's the best way to export out?",
    "The image with the type and have the type look good is a keep the OR be mindful of the format.",
    "Be if you're going to use a.",
    "Hey compressed format like JPEG then you gotta bump up the resolution.",
    "We gotta say OK I gotta make it higher resolution if I want to type still be nice and crisp or or see or back to a use a format that doesn't do as much compression and downsampling like.",
    "P&G dot PNG files or pin files are more forgiving of vector type than JPEG would be.",
    "PDF, the types going to look exactly the same because PDFs maintained the vectors of the type, so it's all usually about the format and the resolution.",
    "If you trying to maintain good looking type across the board.",
    "OK, let's go back to let's get back to the lesson at hand.",
    "So if I go back to my type tool.",
    "And I go back and double click on this, type that by the way, one click will take you in two clicks will select the word, three clicks will select the usually the line 4 clicks will usually select the entire paragraph alright.",
    "The next thing I want to do is talk about.",
    "The formatting so you notice when I have something selected.",
    "Or text selected.",
    "I have these options that the very top, so it's telling Maine what font I'm using.",
    "What style of that font, what size it is.",
    "Is this sharp versus this is mostly for the web, but sharp, crisp, strong, smooth.",
    "It's left just five, it's white.",
    "It's not bent on the warp yet.",
    "And of course I have more options, so those are all my most immediate options that people will want.",
    "So if I wanted to change the color of the type, no problem.",
    "I could click here and change that type to let's say red and now we have the the in red and graduate still in white.",
    "Nice contrast.",
    "Looks cool, I like it.",
    "Plus it kind of matches his little.",
    "Also coming off his graduate hat.",
    "Alright, great, but what if I want to do more and that's what we're going to get into.",
    "So let's say we get to the graduate double click an there's more options than what you're presented with either on these control panels and the way you get to those options is by bringing up what's called the character panel.",
    "So over here on the right hand side, this little panel will toggle the panels open.",
    "There's a character panel, and there's a paragraph count so we can get to the character panel right off the bat.",
    "We can turn it off and kind of see it here and we can see this.",
    "Got a lot more options than just color, size, style and alignment.",
    "It's got a lot more and and you know alignments not here because those options are on a paragraph panel.",
    "Left align center, right align.",
    "Fully justified in dense left and right so forth and so on.",
    "Whether or not you want the type to hyphenate or not.",
    "So all of all of what you will normally want to do.",
    "Can be done.",
    "I would say 90% of what you're going to do with type can be done with these two pounds.",
    "There are the style sheets and all kinds of other things you can do with type, but the majority of the things we're going to do we're here alright.",
    "So now that I've got this the graduate.",
    "Select it and it's telling me what font it is.",
    "How would I change the font?",
    "Well, I can pop up the font menu and what school is as I hover over different fonts it will show it to me.",
    "It will show main what it looks like in context, so that's cool.",
    "I could switch it to something a little kind of like that grungy.",
    "Look what was that?",
    "All that all Mark MCU account like that but it's kinda nice grunge.",
    "Do it so I change the font now when you change a font you change the name of the fonts whatever you want.",
    "It will then present you with whatever styles that font has.",
    "So we're using our mock.",
    "Hopefully I'm pronouncing it correctly.",
    "It's a creative Pol pot so everyone watching this that's a critical member can use that font and the styles for it only has one style.",
    "Rough, and that's what it does.",
    "It looks rough now.",
    "You'll notice that there are other characteristics we talked about point size, so right now it's 60.92 because I stretched it manually.",
    "I wasn't very precise, but I wanted to make that whatever size I want, I can just type it in 65 points.",
    "Now it just got that much bigger just for that one word.",
    "If I if I don't know what size I want, that's one thing I've always not liked about working with type since the very beginning.",
    "I don't know 24.80 point, 60 point I don't know and if you do this every day you will get good at guessing what number it should be.",
    "I don't do this every day so I'm still go 2030 years later.",
    "Not good at guessing.",
    "I'm approximating, I know.",
    "OK, I know approximately what 24 would look like.",
    "I know approximately what 48 will look like, but still I don't know until I see it.",
    "So a couple of ways you can make something bigger or smaller.",
    "And see it visually as you're doing is from the keyboard or from that same option.",
    "You'll notice when we were looking at that panel, we could highlight it.",
    "We can type in a size, but over to the left this little icon it represents.",
    "Eyes.",
    "Look at what happened when I put my cursor over it.",
    "I got these two little arrows pointing left and right and those two little arrows mean that it's scruby mean I can hold my finger down on that icon and scrub back and forth to change that particular parameter which is.",
    "Points us, so if I scrub it to the right type gets bigger, scrub it to the left type get smaller.",
    "So just when you have scruby sliders like these, it just make sure your design process so much easier because I'm not guess I'm looking at the point size.",
    "I'm looking at my image to see what it looks like and if it's too big to small.",
    "Hey Colleen from South Africa, how are you alright?",
    "So the scrubbing sliders are across the border in many of the applications.",
    "If you hover and you get that little double arrow over something then you will know you have it.",
    "If you don't get the double arrow then you know you don't have it.",
    "In that particular application for that particular function now.",
    "At that point, size.",
    "What's this next one?",
    "This next one is called.",
    "Letting letting is the space between the lines so it's easier for me to show you this in in design, 'cause it's just easier.",
    "So let's just do a quick new document, new document.",
    "There it is.",
    "I'll grab my type tool will just grab draw frame, will go to our type menu.",
    "Ann will fill with placeholder text.",
    "That's the way in design does it.",
    "Now we've got this placeholder text.",
    "I'm just going to make my frame a little little longer.",
    "There we go so we can play and then I highlight the entire paragraph with four clicks, click click, click click, click for clicks in a row, then I get the letting over here and I don't get the scruby sliders by the way, and design doesn't have those, but the letting is the space between those lines.",
    "So 12 point type with 14 point letting.",
    "So think of it as I get 2 points of space in between each line.",
    "So if I want to make the spacing between the lines bigger, just increase that number.",
    "And the lines get more spread apart.",
    "You can do this in Photoshop and illustrator as well.",
    "I'm just doing here in in design.",
    "'cause like I said, it's more visual easier to show so in photo shop that option is scrub.",
    "You can even slide it back and forth.",
    "I only have the one line is not going to make any difference, but if I have multiple lines it would work the same way.",
    "OK Next up.",
    "So that's the space between the lines.",
    "You can make it super super big or super tight.",
    "I can get there and click.",
    "There we go make it really tight, spacing between the lines whatever you want.",
    "So instead of like the old word processing days of this line, spacing one 1 1/2 or two, that was pretty much it.",
    "You can make it whatever you needed to be this next one.",
    "Is called tracking or kerning.",
    "This is for setting the space between the characters, so the other one was the lines.",
    "This is the actual space between the characters in words, so it becomes kerning when you're adjusting the space like you have your cursor between 2 letters, it becomes tracking when you're adjusting multiple letters at the same time.",
    "So if we were to zoom in on this.",
    "And let's say we were to click.",
    "I'm just trying to find a good example here in a Q and Q&A U.",
    "So I put my cursor between those two and I then drop that number down.",
    "So I can get the area.",
    "Number am I doing the right number?",
    "Yeah, I'm doing alright number that should be bringing closer.",
    "Whatever reason that's not.",
    "Bring it closer.",
    "Alright, I'm sorry, let me let me go to photo shop.",
    "I'm not sure what I got this set, let's see.",
    "There we go, so yeah, it's making that spacing closer between it, so I made it.",
    "I made it negative, which means give me negative space, but we know so far make it positive.",
    "It means spread those out even more.",
    "You can do it from the keyboard with option left arrow.",
    "And you can even have him overlap each other if you want to.",
    "That's really, really, really tight kerning or option right arrow or alt right arrow if you're on PC, so you can really get in an for characters that you're designing.",
    "It's really bugging me that that's not working the way it should in Indesign.",
    "Hang on.",
    "OK, now it is from the keyboard of this and now it's letting me up.",
    "You know what?",
    "'cause I was doing the wrong one.",
    "That's why I was looking at the wrong symbol.",
    "All right there we go.",
    "So that's the kerning and tracking symbol that I should have been on in the 1st place.",
    "Alright, so that's a way of controlling the look and feel between individual characters is also a nice way to just get things tighter when you're currently in tracking.",
    "Is more looks more professional when you take the time to do it right?",
    "So for example, that's a little too tight.",
    "Right there.",
    "Sure, I wanna sticking.",
    "Control.",
    "Oh I was just saying I was trying to set this.",
    "Wonder what I wanted to be.",
    "Something is going on with my tea in my age, but normally that's what kerning and tracking.",
    "Alright, let's move on to the next one.",
    "So you have these two percentages ones vertical and one horizontal.",
    "That's actually remember when I was stretching the type with the selection tool I was making it taller instruction and so forth and so on.",
    "Well, if you make characters wider than there really are or taller than they usually are.",
    "Shorter than these are.",
    "That's called the vertical and horizontal scale.",
    "So for example, if I were to come back and select the word the and I were to scrub that number higher than the word Nuggets taller because I'm actually changing the vertical scale of those characters.",
    "If I were to change them to be skinnier, they become skinnier.",
    "If I were to change them to become thicker, they become thicker.",
    "Like so, so you can really get in and play with the overall look and feel of your type just by changing those parameters.",
    "Now if I were to drop the point size of that down way down.",
    "Then I can still have that tall look.",
    "Of my type like so.",
    "And maybe not that much on the point size.",
    "Make the voice sounds a little bit bigger.",
    "And even though that's a much smaller type.",
    "It's as much smaller than point size, then the other word.",
    "It's tall because of the horizontal scaling, and now I'm just adjusting my kerning and tracking just a little bit more.",
    "Or it, uhm?",
    "For about a vertical scale is move on.",
    "So what's this next one?",
    "This next one is called superscript and superscript, or I'm sorry now see through baseline shift baseline shift is, as the name implies, shifting the characters from the baseline so they're all slightly Gray line.",
    "We see underneath them.",
    "If I needed a particular character to be above that line, then I can just simply raise it above that line using the baseline shift, so.",
    "Again, just you can do some pretty funky cool things.",
    "You could even know negative, so if you needed a character to be shifted below the baseline, you can actually have characters go below the baseline as well.",
    "So baseline shift up and down either way.",
    "Because of the ligature, yes, you're right.",
    "So the T&H in this case, because my ligatures are turned on is why that was not letting me adjust it.",
    "So let's go back.",
    "And let's turn off the ligatures for this.",
    "There we go and now I should be able to adjust them separately.",
    "All right, good catch.",
    "So the reason I wasn't able to adjust those before is because of another type feature which we just haven't gotten to yet, so that's down here.",
    "So before we get to those, let's get to these next ones.",
    "So this first one.",
    "There's a shortcut for.",
    "Now you see how it says.",
    "Like full, bold and full italic.",
    "That means I'm going to even if your character has a bold or doesn't have your font that has a Boulder, doesn't have a bowl of I'm going to go in and take it.",
    "I'm going to make it look like a bold, so I'm going to make it look like an italic so I don't know what I just did.",
    "Undo, let's zoom back out.",
    "So for example, if I were to highlight that TI.",
    "And I were to do the full bonus.",
    "Just got a little bigger, got a little thicker, let me zoom over there, got a little thicker as if it were both so faux bold means it's not really bold.",
    "Is just giving the effect of it being bold and the same thing with full italic.",
    "If I were to select that word.",
    "And do full italic.",
    "It would lean it'll it'll even though this style we already checked or this one actually does have an Italian, but the other one doesn't have an italic.",
    "So in this case I needed that to look like it had an italic, even though it doesn't.",
    "I can use a full italic on it.",
    "So it's just a way of getting.",
    "Getting a look to a text or font if that particular font does not have that style.",
    "All right, the next ones, so I almost never use full Bolden hotel.",
    "Almost like never, never, never.",
    "When what do I use?",
    "I do use the next ones, so the next ones.",
    "Is, uh, we go back to it is.",
    "All caps, so for example I type this in upper lower case like OK will use the dog I type this in Upper and lower case, but if I all of a sudden change my mind and said I want to see what that looks like there were all caps instead of deleting it and typing it over again in all caps.",
    "I can just go ahead and click all caps and that makes it all caps.",
    "It just toggles it on is even though I did not type it that way and it still upper lower case is just letting you look that way Alright Next Way Next One is.",
    "What we call.",
    "Title case I believe no, not title case.",
    "Well, just look at what I'm hovering over.",
    "It's called basically what is far.",
    "Is it small caps.",
    "That's why I'm looking for title.",
    "Case is different small caps is taking your upper and lower case characters.",
    "Your lower case characters making them capitals but making them smaller.",
    "So there typically your lower case letters or smaller than your upper case letters.",
    "So by doing.",
    "Small caps, I'm saying, do that like make the H&E.",
    "That are lower case.",
    "Make them capitals, but make them small capital.",
    "So if I were to do that for the graduate.",
    "Same thing would happen.",
    "It basically made the R the A The be all way across capitals, but it made them smaller.",
    "All right, Next up is OK.",
    "Now we're going to get into the superscript and subscript.",
    "OK so superscript is like for example, if you were to get some new type here or let's get out of this one.",
    "Let's say here we come in here and we type H2O.",
    "So I I talked about making type bigger with the selection tool.",
    "Now I'm using my keyboard shortcut which is command shift.",
    "So command key, shift key, PC control shift and you're greater than and less than symbols on the US keyboard.",
    "That's your, and period.",
    "So command shift.",
    "Which is greater than makes that type bigger and I can see it visually alright.",
    "So now I've decided that two.",
    "Let's say I want to make the two superscript so I can go in and just click.",
    "And it basically makes it smaller and raises it up.",
    "So baseline shift which we saw earlier doesn't change the size of the type, it just moves it up or down.",
    "This actually makes it bigger or smaller.",
    "Return one off, turn the other one on.",
    "Oh sorry, wrong one.",
    "There we go so that that's what subscript subscript would do.",
    "Subscripts submitting below the line super making it bigger.",
    "So superscript or subscript, whichever one you use will take whatever it is you made.",
    "Will you typed and make it smaller and raise it up or down depending on what you do what you want now the next one?",
    "Pretty self explanatory.",
    "It's an underlying, which again, that's another one I just don't use.",
    "It's a rule under it.",
    "Underline because if I want an underlying under my type I will use a rule.",
    "I never use the actual type.",
    "Feature you can going wrong with it as just it's kind of just an old-fashioned thing that people that want things you wanted something to stand out back in the typewriter days.",
    "You didn't have a bold.",
    "Remember typewriters anyway?",
    "You didn't have a bowl.",
    "You didn't have a font choice, so you would underline something to make it stand out more.",
    "And of course the other one is strikethrough, which that is handy like we're trying to illustrate.",
    "This text is no longer relevant, you just quit strikethrough.",
    "They had to go through it.",
    "Now the next ones.",
    "Um, are what we call Opentype features, and that's where I got hung up on my literature earlier, so that T&H were joined together.",
    "Here, let me go get him out of small caps first.",
    "They were joined together and I wasn't really thinking about it.",
    "That ligatures can be turned on automatically and I didn't make it a ligature, it just did it automatically because certain characters like FLFI like a a lowercase.",
    "Here, let's do it, a Lowercase F and a lowercase I next to each other.",
    "You don't want the dot in the way.",
    "Let's do this.",
    "Experiment type tool.",
    "There we go.",
    "And let's do SI.",
    "See, there's no doubt because Photoshop automatically converted that into a ligature without me doing anything.",
    "I have to tell it, it just happened automatically and So what a ligature is as opposed to a not ligature is it would be that that's not a ligature, so designers have designed type for years saying that that looks weird having that F.",
    "Annette ion at dot right there.",
    "Nothing wrong with it.",
    "That's what you want, but we're going to help you out design wise.",
    "We're going to turn that ligature feature on to wear.",
    "Makes the app extend a little bit more where the dot would be and it takes the day off, so that's what happened with my T&H earlier is that it?",
    "Let's get out of this one.",
    "It made that one a ligature and I wasn't thinking about it.",
    "So if I turn that feature on.",
    "Hold on, we got too many things selected in anything selected.",
    "There we go.",
    "I was not going to do it 'cause I've got all this screwed up right here.",
    "Let's let's just go do it here.",
    "I got too many things turned on or off on the other one.",
    "So let's go do it here.",
    "Let's do.",
    "Oh my God, all of this is remembering all my bad settings.",
    "Hang on.",
    "Or in my room are really small living.",
    "There we go.",
    "All right?",
    "Yeah, I made it way way, way too big.",
    "Alright, so other bugs.",
    "I just had things specked out too big to fit on screen.",
    "Alright, so now we turn that literature feature on.",
    "No, I'm not getting what I want.",
    "Why is that?",
    "Super or?",
    "No computer font.",
    "Hang on, I'm sorry one more thing.",
    "Not right now.",
    "There we go, so see what is to see what it did to the TH.",
    "It joined them together, so that's what the literature did.",
    "Also, for the FBI that I had earlier so.",
    "It's just been flaking on me right now, standard literature.",
    "Ann Nope, those are contextual alternates and only those.",
    "Are OK, Next One, which is contextual alternates.",
    "So contextual alternates are.",
    "I was serious demonstrated.",
    "Go here.",
    "Just gonna get out of this one.",
    "Good.",
    "Let Maine.",
    "Kind of do a reset here.",
    "Alright, Here we go.",
    ".3 type is really small by the way.",
    "There we go.",
    "So you see how when I hover over the over over a particular letter, this menu drops down.",
    "These are alternate, so sometimes there alternate glyphs sometimes are alternate characters that gave me like the small small cap version of that TI, but hover over it will give me those so it's not giving a bunch of choices, but if I change this type to a font that has a bunch of choices in my go to example for that font would be.",
    "Bickham script pro has a ton of alternates.",
    "So if I highlight.",
    "Can get one character highlighted here.",
    "Here we go highlighting just the letter S gives me all these alternate SS to use, so if I chose that S instead then it makes it that S.",
    "So some fonts will have lots of alternates, some will have none.",
    "And by the way, when it's hard to select one particular character, you can hold down your control key and.",
    "You're, I'm sorry.",
    "Your shift key in your arrow and so I just did a shift arrow back to just select that one character.",
    "I can keep going and keep doing more by keep shift.",
    "Selecting or sift going backwards, but it will.",
    "It will not give you the alternates that I want.",
    "So in this case I want the alternates from the letter E on the end is giving me a bunch so it's like playing a game, show us, show me the ease and I get all the different keys that I can choose.",
    "So same thing if I hold down the shift key and select.",
    "Forward one character, then I get all of the letter T's that I could choose, and you can really get in and get some nice alternates.",
    "The next one over is these are alternately or discretionary ligatures.",
    "So we had the ligatures that we saw that were automatic, like the FBI and FBI, and TH discretionary ligatures are based on the font.",
    "So if the font has discretionary ligatures in it, then you'll be able to choose it.",
    "Alright, I'm looking at something looking at the comments here, just making sure I'm not missing anything.",
    "Alright, so anyway Next up.",
    "Next, one Swash or alternate swashes so all of these.",
    "The ones at the bottom are again Opentype features that are dependent on the font.",
    "So if I choose something on the font doesn't have it, nothing will happen, so I'd have to think about what font has alternate.",
    "Alternate swashes or alternate glyphs or alternate characteristics about it.",
    "Like this one has stylistic alternatives, so if I turn that on that in that particular font had it, I would be able to see them.",
    "So these these three right here or 4 right here, all depend very much on the font that you're using, so don't be disappointed.",
    "I turn this on and nothing happened, it just means you turn it on for that font and nothing happened because that doesn't have any of those extra characters.",
    "So every font designed by a font maker has to have or.",
    "A font designer has to have all those extra characters in them.",
    "Now, how would I know?",
    "What my fonts have in terms of characters?",
    "Well, one of the easy ways from a type standpoint instead of guessing is to bring up.",
    "I think I've had it down there already, but to bring up your your glyphs panel so the glyphs panel this panel right here.",
    "Will show you everything if you choose the entire font, it will show you everything with that font has.",
    "If you choose alternate glyphs, which is what I like to have this on.",
    "Most of the time, then you can see for any particular character what that particular font has.",
    "So if I go up here, this one doesn't have a lot of alternates.",
    "If I'd choose let's just choose another font at random, like the graduate.",
    "Fargo here.",
    "It's like that D no alternates whatsoever.",
    "So every thought is different.",
    "Some will have one, two, 510 or nun just depends on the font.",
    "So if I come down here again and select this and choose a different font.",
    "Let's choose or something at random.",
    "Here was going to grab a different.",
    "Different critical Fox.",
    "And I.",
    "Highlight one character, no alternates for this one.",
    "This one does not have any alternates at all, so again, it just depends on the font, and I know it's kind of like, Oh Man, I really wish I could do all this cool stuff.",
    "It just depends on the font that you choose.",
    "Some will have cool things.",
    "You can do, some won't.",
    "Alright, let's do one more.",
    "Let's do this one.",
    "OK, 1 second.",
    "I get out of here we go.",
    "Yeah, and same thing, so no alternates for this one.",
    "So it really depends on the font maker and this one does definitely does not have a bunch of characters to begin with.",
    "Every fonts different Next up.",
    "How do we associate finish these so we have?",
    "Totally altered tilting alternatives or titling alternatives, and then you have ordinal ordinals an fractions, So what are ordinals infractions?",
    "Let's well, we know what fractions are water ordinals?",
    "So let's say we type 2nd and we type 1/2.",
    "Well, that's the way you would type it, but that's not the way you want it to look.",
    "So if I if I highlight this one half and I choose fractions, that makes it look like a real fraction by highlight the words or the term 2nd and I choose an ordinal.",
    "And this particular one doesn't have an ordinal, so let's pick a font that does.",
    "Tom, let's see.",
    "Half of the challenge is having the right font that will do what you need.",
    "So let's go back to mirror.",
    "It might have it.",
    "No, it doesn't have it either.",
    "Alright, if it had it, it would take the like.",
    "Third, it would take the R&D and almost make it look like it was, uhm, subscript, but it wouldn't put it below the line.",
    "It would just make it smaller like third should look.",
    "And so that's why.",
    "For example, when I look at these.",
    "Ordinals it says first, and then it's the one in the St, is raised up.",
    "That's what an ordinal will do, so I'm sorry, not below.",
    "Raise it up so it's almost like a superscript, but it's the right, it does the right thing for the type, and it also smart enough to know, like if you were to type that that's not a real thing 'cause its third, not firmed, then it would not do it for those characters.",
    "But again, having a font that that works in is the key.",
    "So this one has fractions.",
    "Let's see if we turn this one into 3/4.",
    "And we do a fraction.",
    "Yeah, that one works.",
    "OK so it just depends on the font that you have, whether or not it has those features in it.",
    "So we did everything there, so let's pop over to in design.",
    "I think I might have one more example to show you here.",
    "And it's kind of hard explaining things without actually having the visual to show you.",
    "So let me just go in real quick.",
    "And show you the example that I want to show you.",
    "Forgot wrong folder Virgo.",
    "And we're gonna go look at in design demo files.",
    "For whatever reason.",
    "Start.",
    "Wrong one again.",
    "That's where I wanna be.",
    "For whatever reason, I am not seeing my folder with that pilot.",
    "There we go and design services over looking at.",
    "And this is the document I want.",
    "Here we go.",
    "Cool.",
    "Alright, let's move.",
    "Alright, so this particular font is great for ordinals infractions, and it is Adobe gehrman pro.",
    "So for example, if I were to highlight these and I were even some of these more difficult ones and I were to turn on the.",
    "The Opentype feature let's go back to our character panel here.",
    "There we go.",
    "I want my actual.",
    "What I want is the actual so here.",
    "Sorry wrong, this way there we go.",
    "If I were to go in and then turn on my Opentype features an hour to go to my fractions, there were there are, it will just convert all those directions.",
    "Same thing here.",
    "If I were to choose and make these ordinals.",
    "Open tribe ordinal.",
    "It will convert those to ordinals.",
    "That's why I was trying to show you the photo shop.",
    "I just didn't have the right font to show it with, so this I put this document together or this document is actually put together years ago to kind of show off some of these features.",
    "So the same thing with these with being the ligatures if we were to go in and.",
    "Go to hour.",
    "Look at your features there is.",
    "It will just do the right thing with the FI and the rest.",
    "Alright, I think that's it.",
    "This one has its own set of ligatures, which is kind of interesting.",
    "Square stylistically ligatures overlay.",
    "Not right?",
    "Sure, let me get to it from.",
    "Discretionary ligatures, that's what I want.",
    "So you see, the discretionary ligatures for this one.",
    "It just makes the H&E like joined together.",
    "It puts the I inside of the L.",
    "So just really cool things.",
    "Depending on the type that you want.",
    "All right, uhm?",
    "So lots of standard layout is getting in the weeds there.",
    "With all these different opentype styles because you can get in the weeds with those, but again, getting back to the essentials, adding the type, changing the type sizing the type.",
    "Just want to go through.",
    "Make sure I got through all of those character options.",
    "If we go back to our other end design documents there is one more set of features that is fairly new.",
    "I'll do it on this one 'cause this one is already set up for it.",
    "And that is if you have.",
    "This.",
    "Goes text unlock it?",
    "So I got this word explore.",
    "And this particular font that Explorer uses brings up one more option that we didn't see anywhere else.",
    "It's a variable font.",
    "In variable fonts are new, just like color fonts are new, so we have two new kind of font standards.",
    "They're all open type with the two new fonts styles coming out color, which means the actual characters are colors that were designed by the baht Mac maker and variable.",
    "So we talked about styles, bold, italic, heavy.",
    "Expanded condensed, so forth and so on, but.",
    "What if you need something that's in between?",
    "I need something in between bold and medium, or in between medium and heavy.",
    "There's usually you're stuck at that point.",
    "You usually at the mercy of the font maker.",
    "But if they make a variable font, there's one more thing.",
    "This little button right here.",
    "This little button only appears when you have a variable font selected.",
    "So when I have that variable font selected and I bring my variable options, it gives me sliders again based on what the bot maker let me do weight within slant.",
    "If I choose wait, it will make the font thinner.",
    "And thicker as I slide this around, the frame got too big.",
    "That's why it disappears.",
    "It's not too big footprint.",
    "Same thing with width.",
    "Can I make the text skinnier an or thicker?",
    "And again, if I make that frame bigger, we'd see it.",
    "Same thing with slant, even if there's no italic.",
    "I can slap the text as much or as little as I want, so if it's already italic and they need to be a little bit more leaning, I can make it more leaning or less lini by adjusting the slant.",
    "So variable type is going to be another option you have, as long as you have variable fonts that.",
    "Option will not show up on your regular type.",
    "It has to be a font that was made as a variable font to begin with, so that way you get to pick and choose exactly how you want to type to look and you won't have to worry about anyone else having that same type.",
    "It will be just yours.",
    "Art.",
    "List and I miss some of the questions here.",
    "There was one earlier.",
    "Dirt and how many farts can I use on a standard flyer?",
    "It's like just because you can doesn't mean you should.",
    "So if you're asking that question, you're probably thinking too many.",
    "How many can you use?",
    "There's no, there's really no real limit.",
    "I've seen documents with dozens of fonts on them, but that doesn't make it good, so you should be only using as few as necessary.",
    "So just again, the technology is not going to get in your way.",
    "It will let you design something with 100 points on the page.",
    "You shouldn't be designing something with 100 fonts on the page.",
    "But unless it's a font guide other than that, less is more.",
    "Um?",
    "As many as you need, yeah, calling let's let's keep it to not that many.",
    "Alright, let's see if I miss anything over here.",
    "No phone need it.",
    "Oh my God, yeah.",
    "Alright, um, that's either going to leave it here 'cause we covered a lot.",
    "I got a little bit more past the essentials I was trying to cover.",
    "I got kind of carried away and just showing you as many of the options that I could with all of these things.",
    "So there's many more type features that we could talk about, but for your essentials those are the ones that.",
    "Most people will use on a regular basis and again when it you notice the positioning of where things were in that menu.",
    "So it starts with the more important stuff at the top and then it goes down in the weeds down here because most people are going to use those are in need those things in a regular basis.",
    "So just I would say stick to as a beginner, everything above.",
    "Maybe this line for now and then you will learn more as you go.",
    "You can also just as a quick reminder for people that forget these things you can also.",
    "Type in the exact font you want.",
    "So if I want it minion pro I could just start typing minion pro and it will get to that specific font and let me choose it.",
    "If you want to find a font, these are now tips and tricks.",
    "If you wanted to find a font, but you don't know what you need, you just need something bold.",
    "You just need something heavy, you just need something thin.",
    "Then I could type in heavy and it will find all my heavy fonts.",
    "So if I said EFF are heavy is what I was looking for.",
    "That looks good great.",
    "Then I have that font.",
    "If you want more fronts than the one you actually, the ones you actually have, you can get two more fonts.",
    "By going to more Adobe fonts.",
    "So in your front menu you now have this more Adobe fonts option right here and you get more Adobe fonts, but it will take you to the Adobe fonts web page.",
    "Which I just brought up over here.",
    "And you can then click OK and I want to read that message and then you can start finding fonts for what for what you want and you can even type in what you wanted to say.",
    "So if I wanted to say.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Then I can see my example in all the different fonts that I would be choosing so I can narrow it down to just show me the scripts so I can see thank you and scripts.",
    "And if I like.",
    "By like this font.",
    "Hello my love then I can go ahead and view that font family.",
    "And if I like it, I can activate that font.",
    "So just by turning it on, that phone is now syncing to my computer and it will be available in all my Adobe applications and all my non Adobe applications as well.",
    "Or at least I'm glad this was super helpful for you.",
    "Sorry I got a little carried away, there was some of the options I didn't really mean to go that far, but it's been awhile since I streamed I guess so I got kind of get carried away.",
    "Also didn't want to make it this long so now hello my love is there and I can choose hello my love.",
    "And use it in Photoshop, illustrator, indesign, word, PowerPoint.",
    "If you're using those whatever else it whatever else it is and no sponsor now available to me and ready to go.",
    "Let's see if it has any alternates.",
    "I'm always looking for fonts with alternate goosey.",
    "This one has lots of cool alternates.",
    "Scripts usually do, so that's why I was kind of like.",
    "Let's see, this one's got a lot of nice.",
    "A lot of nice alternates on the end.",
    "That's a little carried away, but.",
    "There are.",
    "There are things I like about time, passionate about type.",
    "I like type type swung.",
    "It always separates the beginners for from the professionals because beginners will just type a word and leave it there.",
    "Professionals will actually design the type.",
    "They will adjust the letting the kerning the tracking the alternates so forth and so on.",
    "So if you're just typing words and leaving them on the page without doing anything more to them, that's why others are other documents you're looking at.",
    "Wow, that looks so much better and cooler than mine.",
    "Because they're taking the time to massage the type that they put on the page, they they're not necessarily doing all this crazy stuff that I did hear, but they're doing things that make it stand out and make it look different.",
    "Contrast is key.",
    "I know let's get this back up where it belongs.",
    "Contrast is key also.",
