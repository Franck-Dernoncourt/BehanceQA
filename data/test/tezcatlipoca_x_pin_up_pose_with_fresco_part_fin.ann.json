    "But then the heavier the file gets and that's that's not good when you have iPad is a strong machine surface is strong machine, but once you have a whole lot of layers and a lot of content in these layers, the processor really starts to grind down some of the colors are not very happy with like this.",

    "Now when I first got this iPad 11 an I had this Apple pencil.",
    "I had trouble drawing on it because I'm not used to drawing with a hard tip on a glass and so this proved to be very difficult to to control my lines and but once I few days ago I got the paper like screen protector and has little Groovy surface and now I get a lot more friction when I'm drawing and now I'm able to control my pin.",

    "Tell me yet it wasn't sure.",
    "I wasn't sure if I was going to be actually live and I did make it.",
    "Ha ha Oh yeah.",
    "Has anybody tried Adobe fresco yet?",
    "Oh, I think he said paper like yes, sorry Garrett.",
    "An Adrian had been lost in my world.",
    "Thank you for joining the conversation.",
    "Yes, Garrett is the paper like.",
    "I don't think it's the official paper like it's one of those knockouts on Amazon.",
    "Thank you Adrian for answering the question, but it is a paper like and let me go ahead and switch and so it's kind of hard to see it from up there.",
    "And it's a mess.",
    "Sorry about my desk, but yes, I was crazy.",
    "Is that it already had a screen protector, but it's one of those glass screen protectors and then so there's like a gap now in between the edge of the iPad because the paper like goes all the way to the edge, whereas the screen protector that was there, the glass windows did not go to the edge.",
    "But I'm OK with that and it was you, so that's how that's how I got it.",
    "And so.",
    "So that now it gives me like this texture over the screen protector.",
    "An screen protector gives me this texture which is really great as I'm drawing, so when I'm drawing.",
    "I am able to have a better grip on the paper or on the screen then normally with just the glass.",
    "So this is a big big plus for me.",
    "I like that and it's going to has improved on my on my control hand control.",
    "And has been always been my one of my.",
    "My problems with the Apple.",
    "Is that it has a?",
    "It's a great pencil, right?",
    "Everything is awesome.",
    "iPad is awesome.",
    "The pencil is really great.",
    "I like the way they made the tip, but when you're drawing against the glass it is very hard to control as if you used to draw with paper.",
    "Is manageable, you can deal with it, but after awhile you'll feel that fatigue in your hand and it's going to start hurting your fingers.",
    "So I like the ice surface because the surface has different types of tips and these different types of tips are going to help you.",
    "Give you that feel on the glass that you're used to weather is to be, I mean #2, pencil, HB and so on because they have different tips.",
    "So if Apple can make different tips, we'd be in the house.",
    "Oh yeah, that'll be.",
    "That'll be great.",
    "Go ahead, Apple.",
    "And I expect Apple to make an Apple pencil for the iPhone one day.",
    "And then there an to make their MacBook pros touch ha ha ha that be great.",
    "Any case, thank you for answering that question.",

    "And.",
    "It has a drawer for you to put some paints in here.",
    "But I don't use it for that.",
    "I use it for the iPad and as you can tell I have a centriq over here, so I'm used to drawing Ida angle and so this makes it amazing.",
    "This little easel makes it really easy to go ahead and raw.",
    "This easy easel.",
    "And so appreciate you and thank you for noticing.",
    "This go.",
    "There you go.",
    "So make sure Gary share your work on be hands.",

    "No pressure.",
    "I do like checking out other artists work.",

    "Found somebody on Facebook was a Facebook.",
    "Yes it wasn't Facebook marketplace.",
    "And they had just switched everything to Android, not an artist.",
    "And.",
    "So it was ready, get rid of it.",
    "I said I'll take it.",
    "I have a couple iPads.",
    "There's another iPad here next to me that's doing the live streaming with Sinamaica route to be hands.",
    "This an iPad 9.7 nine .7.",
    "Is yeah 'cause it's the.",
    "So yes, almost or 10 something is 10.9.",
    "He has a 10.9.",
    "And then I have another iPad 12.",
    ".9.",
    "And.",
    "This old are still works great though.",
    "I'd drawn anything and everything, then I gotta few surface devices.",
    "Waiting on that surface studio, Microsoft.",
    "Microsoft.",
    "Send me the app surface studio.",
    "So I can brag on it.",
    "Wouldn't that be nice?",
    "Hey.",
    "Huh?",
    "Oh yeah.",
    "And I can draw faster.",
    "When I have more control.",
    "Yes, and I like the UM, organic.",
    "Feel of drawing a fresco are going to be pretty disappointed in that any work on their get.",
    "I'm very new to the world of Frisco iPad digital artwork.",
    "OK Gary, that's cool.",
    "I won't be disappointed.",
    "I'll just post something, but yes, that's great that you're getting into some fresco drawing with the iPad.",
    "It is.",
    "Adobe fresco is amazing and there's knew changes happening every week, like as an update.",
    "There's always a new update.",
    "And I enjoy it.",
    "I was just talking about that and getting into that aspect of Frisco is that it is a great drawing app in.",
    "My case, I love the.",
    "Vector brushes, that's what I'm using right now.",
    "The vector brushes.",
    "And so.",
    "It's a.",
    "To me it helps me with the artwork that I create because I'm all about the vector artwork and I like to scale my artwork and and so if you have vector brushes the way fresco does then you can draw in vector and have organic looking artwork.",
    "Versus when you draw in illustrator, which is beautiful.",
    "'cause I love illustrator, I love drawing with pencil.",
    "Hey Kendrick, ask your question, let's go for it.",
    "And but sometimes it can look a little stiff.",
    "And so I like Adobe fresco for the fact that I can make it look more organic.",
    "I'm OK with some of these squiggly lines and not, uh.",
    "Going to be a perfectionist and say this line is to be super perfect, but it's going to be aligned.",
    "That looks like somebody drew it by hand and ask what I want in Frisco can do that for us.",
    "Illustrator can to an extent, but illustrator is not made for hand drawing and I'm a pretty fast drawer and so I end up crashing illustrator.",
    "So that's why I like drawing with fresco you'll find fresco to be an amazing piece of software that you can run on your iPad.",
    "It has pixel.",
    "Can I go to the bathroom?",
    "You want me to stop talking Kendrick and then pick it up when you come back from the bathroom?",
    "The proper question is may I?",
    "Any case?",
    "The dobie fresco does have a lot of different types of brushes for different kinds of people, including live rushes and um.",
    "Uh.",
    "Pixel based brushes.",
    "There we go.",
    "That's that I don't like the way that came out, so let's fix it.",
    "Kind of want it more like this.",
    "Of.",
    "And his best to always draw.",
    "The line come in at you.",
    "There we go much better.",
    "Select seal if oh what Kendrick Jose got to say when he comes back.",
    "And I am going to click on.",
    "Garrett and Adrian's profiles see what we get.",
    "And Adrian got a lot of work on snap he can draw.",
    "And Garrett, you got some mood boards.",
    "Word up.",
    "Nolan, you follow some good art.",
    "I like that I like checking out mood boards 'cause.",
    "I need to stay up to date and what other artists are doing.",
    "All right?",
    "Right, I gotta get to drawing.",
    "Taking too long with this drawing.",
    "Come on.",
    "Uh-huh All right?",
    "Let's see, we got here.",
    "Little.",
    "I'm back, I dare you to do a work in Ms paint.",
    "You know, I'm not against it.",
    "A Ms paint I've drawn in worse.",
    "Can I will draw on anything you hand me alright, send me a computer.",
    "With Ms paint installed and our draw on it, how 'bout?",
    "That's a deal.",
    "And as far as velocity, smoothness, etc.",
    "Right now you're in Russia, is that right now I'm already mentioned this.",
    "Now I am.",
    "I didn't talk about my brush settings, however I am using just a vector brushes so these are the vector brushes over here.",
    "I'm using the basic round.",
    "An my settings for it are basic.",
    "I did not touch anything.",
    "I did not move anything.",
    "Only thing I did was turn off the pressure dynamics when you have pressure dynamics on you will get the pressure right.",
    "You can go like that.",
    "And if the if you draw lately, you get a thin line.",
    "If you draw press harder than you get a thicker line when you turn off the pressure dynamics, you get that solid line is one same line.",
    "Wait, no matter how hard you press or how fast you go in right now.",
    "Because of this, our style that I'm working with right now, I wanted to have the whole basic one.",
    "Guys line weight.",
    "But I don't do too much of, uhm.",
    "Of.",
    "Brush settings edits.",
    "I kind of like the way.",
    "Some of the.",
    "Settings are already are because especially when I'm drawing with with Vector, it son really more interested in making sure that I have language that have lines and artwork, that is, that is scalable.",
    "So so not too much adjustment if you're going to work in with.",
    "Water colors, you know the light brushes that are included in Frisco?",
    "Then yeah, you probably will want to play what your settings.",
    "But not so much when it comes to.",
    "Vector brushes",
    "There we go.",
    "And this artwork I already worked on live on Behance.",
    "Do a lot of live streaming on Behance and on Facebook.",

    "The cool thing is that I have.",
    "My life streaming system has a way that I can switch computers.",
    "And even though I'm on the surface right now.",
    "I'll be able to bring you into my.",
    "Surface.",
    "Without leaving the stream.",
    "Never down.",
    "All right?",
    "Jokes are allowed, they just have to be clean jokes like jokes where if a child was to hear it, he would laugh too or she would laugh too.",

    "That's crazy.",
    "Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm still going to do that at a different time.",
    "That's not for this stream.",

    "And it turned out these notifications.",
    "Let's see that right now.",

    "Where is it there goes to saving right there.",
    "Boom boom boom are we going to switch over to a new computer in a second?",
    "Test done.",
    "And that's done done boom.",
    "Alright, so we go out of the document and it's going to.",
    "Sync and save.",
    "So now it's done alright, so I've exported both of these documents there out in my drop box.",
    "Now right as PDFs that's important.",
    "OK, let me maneuver some wires here.",
    "Because this is delicate stuff.",
    "Alright Boom Boom Boom.",
    "Gotta cords and wires you saw what I had going on let me get on this side on this computer.",
    "So I can switch out.",
    "A button.",
    "And you guys don't need to see that.",
    "Yet.",
    "Land.",
    "Move.",
    "Why here?",
    "Uh-huh Move.",
    "This over this is my microphone.",
    "So I had to make sure that I bring it.",
    "Otherwise you case can't hear me OK, got it?",
    "And.",
    "I wasn't prepared for all of this.",
    "I said Oh let me go online and see if it works and it worked.",
    "So now here I am.",
    "I haven't gone.",
    "Bum bum bum yeah everything that I'm doing right now you can see I'm moving things around moving things around.",
    "And now I'm going to.",
    "Let's see.",
    "Just leave that right there.",
    "Let's see if I can put this here, that's good.",
    "OK, I need some room gal.",
    "OK, there it is.",
    "That's good.",
    "So Kendra you like going different places and just saying stuff right?",
    "I appreciate it.",
    "That's good, man.",
    "Somebody, somebody gotta keep it light 'cause life is a little bit treacherous right now.",
    "OK, so now there's ghost isn't working yet, so there's my screen now.",
    "Let me go ahead and put that down.",
    "So now I am on my surface.",
    "This is my centriq and but I'm going to be drawing on my surface and let's go ahead and get my.",
    "Yep, it's working.",
    "Let's go like this so that is not in the way.",
    "Boom where up.",
    "We're making it happen.",
    "I'm glad you guys are still sticking around and be like then dancers know Dan, this is like no OK, light sun is shining so any case?",
    "So we're on my surface is a Microsoft Surface Pro 5 it's a few years old.",
    "This is my centriq so everything is connected and let me go ahead and open illustrator right?",
    "So what we have done so far is I worked on two different images in Adobe fresco which if I was to open Adobe fresco here on the surface, you'll see those same files.",
    "And.",
    "As you can see, already worked on a couple of these files already in illustrator, but if I was to open fresco this open fresco you'll see those same 2 files and was cool about that is is that there will be creative.",
    "Cloud is sinking things.",
    "See there they are right there it is.",
    "My recent files.",
    "I've worked on them on this device also so that's why you can see them right there and so they are up to date and they have synced with what I've done.",
    "On the iPad.",
    "To me, that's amazing.",
    "That's great.",
    "I really like that.",
    "I'm able to jump through devices and have access to the same files.",
    "All right, listen to two streams at the same time.",
    "Cool Kendrick.",
    "I love that alright, so no more fresco.",
    "Let's turn that off, close it, and now let's go ahead and jump into some illustrators.",
    "So let's go ahead and open.",
    "Find that file.",
    "Bom bom bom.",
    "Here we go and discuss 6.",
    "That's the one.",
    "As you can see, if the PDF file is opening an illustrator right now.",
    "Bam, there it is.",
    "This is an illustrator file.",
    "However, there are some housekeeping things that we must do.",
    "A lot of times, um, some artifacts.",
    "From the mobile PDF format shows up here and we have to get rid of some things.",
    "Uh, and so I'm gonna clean up a little bit.",
    "Here we go.",
    "This is the background, so let me go like this and like that.",
    "And then these two groups.",
    ", They're going to go here and that's called background.",
    "I need to clean up this art where we go Boom Boom Boom Boom boom there it is so now these are the colors.",
    "And you guys can see what I got right?",
    "So lot of colours.",
    "There's one of the colors.",
    "And so as long as you keep all your colors on a different layer.",
    "Um, you'll be have them on different layers in illustrator and I like that because I'm going to show you what happens.",
    "There we go.",
    "I like that because I can select all the colors on one layer at one time by clicking on that layer and then I can change those colors.",
    "So there's something here that still stuck.",
    "What is happening?",
    "Oh OK, I'm using that there you go like this.",
    "There it is all vector.",
    "You see that that's all vector.",
    "These are anchor points.",
    "Woo, so that's the suit.",
    "Alright, keep it rolling.",
    "That is going to be loops, know, know, know, know.",
    "Go back.",
    "There we go that one.",
    "Boom this.",
    "Is some of the shadows shadows boom?",
    "And so I'm starting to name a layer suit.",
    "Shadows.",
    "Layer management is important.",
    "You have to know how to manage your layers.",
    "Name them so that the next artist and designer that comes behind you is not faced with a mess.",
    "So here's some that blue that's all blue.",
    "Uh-huh Blue Bam.",
    "There we go.",
    "There we go, clipping pass.",
    "This is the red.",
    "Just like that's a little tedious in the beginning because now you're not drawing, you're kinda arranging and but later on as you're working further and further is very important that you have this step done, rose.",
    "Alright, let's get more layers.",
    "So that's going to be the green, of course.",
    "There we go.",
    "And I know the colors and I can see them, but I'm going to adjust them anyways.",
    "There we go.",
    "I know there's a light green.",
    "Purple, of course, was only two pieces in purple.",
    "Purple.",
    "And let's see.",
    "Alright, let's see.",
    "This is the magenta or something like that.",
    "It's like purple.",
    "And then pink.",
    "This is the bottom tip of the pencil.",
    "There we go.",
    "This like those up.",
    "And this starts saving this as an illustrator file, save as and we're going with illustrator and now vector 6.",
    "It's gonna call it 7.",
    "Seven there it is, save it.",
    "And of course all the other things that blah blah very cool.",
    "Very cool key role in is it done now?",
    "Still saving OK good.",
    "Esco.",
    "Clipping path purple.",
    "This is another purple.",
    "What is going on here?",
    "This purple 2.",
    "Hum.",
    "This is a yellow.",
    "Oral gold or something?",
    "Let's go with gold.",
    "If I can spell gold.",
    "Clipping path gotta delete all these little clipping path.",
    "I'm going to talk to the illustrator team about it.",
    "I seriously am.",
    "Let's go with an.",
    "Dark gold",
    "Uh-huh more layers.",
    "Let's see what we got here.",
    "Clipping path.",
    "This is another blue.",
    "Light blue.",
    "Hum, hum.",
    "This another Blues lighter blue.",
    "Boom Here is the purple for the face, so this is.",
    "Dark blue All right?",
    "More layers.",
    "Cool, cool, this is a Brown.",
    "Hum, hum.",
    "Dark Brown COO COO COO is this another Brown?",
    "Right?",
    "Here it is.",
    "Uh, so dark Brown 2.",
    "Another Brown, this is a light Brown.",
    "I got lots of Browns.",
    "All my colors are going to be primary.",
    "Primary colors only.",
    "I do play around with.",
    "Um, some colors but.",
    "Color combinations, but are not so much light.",
    "And then.",
    "More layers.",
    "Uh-huh Oh, I didn't clean them.",
    "Clipping path.",
    "Here we go.",
    "All right?",
    "Brown I guess that's the hair.",
    "The other ones were the hair.",
    "Alright, go here here.",
    "Delete that.",
    "I don't even know how many Browns I have.",
    "Good thing is that they are in different layers so that I can do more things with them.",
    "And So what color is this?",
    "Unless the pencil.",
    "I'm not there.",
    "It goes here.",
    "And you want to separate these, because once you once you start making adjustments and illustrator is going to start adding extra layers and you don't want to lose the order of your layers and so then all this when I'm doing right now becomes important.",
    "Hi this is the faces of the eyebrows, yeah?",
    "Alright, let's go here.",
    "Cool.",
    "Browse Boom And What is this here?",
    "I need to get rid of that this ellipse.",
    "And.",
    "I think I left that notice there, Scott.",
    "Home.",
    "So this right here is some of the shadow.",
    "Oh yeah, this is all the shadow.",
    "Come on.",
    "Yeah, so let's clear that up.",
    "So here's one.",
    "Let's get rid of that clipping mask.",
    "There we go.",
    "And I think I lost something in translation, so let's keep that good together.",
    "Foot shadow All right?",
    "This is the other for shadow here.",
    "Yes, 'cause I have two.",
    "Yep, it's down there.",
    "Got it.",
    "This one of the shadows, as you can see I turn down the Opacity.",
    "When I was doing the some of these shadows and installed it retains that opacity.",
    "That blend mode is still active, which is great if you do too many blend modes at one of four one layer, it will not.",
    "PDF won't be able to support it.",
    "OK, this is shadow.",
    "And it's a shadow 2.",
    "Got it.",
    "For get this, delete it.",
    "Oh, getting there now almost done this.",
    "Let's see what do we have here?",
    "What is this?",
    "Oh, let's delete that first.",
    "OK, what are you all is my bottom highlight.",
    "Oh, it's one of my highlights now.",
    "This is the.",
    "The left highlight is supposed to be or is still, the highlights highlights.",
    "OK, so let's go here.",
    "Boom Boom Boom boom.",
    "Hi boom this one.",
    "Clear out the clipping mask.",
    "Boom Anna's the other highlight.",
    "Yep.",
    "Hi too.",
    "We had a couple highlight layers, then there is.",
    "My purplish layer that's the bottom highlight.",
    "Oh no, these are my dots.",
    "These are purple dots.",
    "Purple.",
    "But it's really the bottom bottom bottom light.",
    "Bottom light dots and then these are my bottom lights.",
    "Let's see.",
    "Yep, this is the bottom lights.",
    "Bottom goof hold up.",
    "I need the whole thing.",
    "Is there?",
    "What's happening to yeah.",
    "There it goes.",
    "Bottom and then this is another bottom.",
    "Look at all these layers.",
    "Fresco supports a lot of layers.",
    "Then do you have you seen the new feature in illustrator?",
    "We can simplify your vector points throughout your whole.",
    "Please.",
    "Yes, yes it had.",
    "I have an I haven't played around with it enough to find it useful.",
    "And then these are pieces there staying in house.",
    "I'm not hand them off to anyone, so.",
    "But yes, uh.",
    "It is useful so that you can cut down on the size of your document.",
    "It helps out alot except that right now this is a very organic looking artwork and so the anchor points are going to be all over the place.",
    "All right, so that is my lines.",
    "These are other lines.",
    "OK.",
    "Lock that up or turn unlock it.",
    "So why do I do about these lines?",
    "Analyst?",
    "Even right there, that's good.",
    "So now I grab all of this.",
    "And no, no no, no, not yet.",
    "As a matter of fact suits there we go grab these, put it into one in one is desky X.",
    "There it is.",
    "And then this is the background and that's it.",
    "I organize my layers, woo.",
    "Save it, click control S.",
    "And they will save.",
    "You think is barking Kendry Crazy Man.",
    "Alright there you go saved.",
    "Hanging on simplification could work.",
    "I want to make sure that my artwork looks away.",
    "I drew it so I'm afraid of that simplification of the anchor points, but I may try it.",
    "I need to.",
    "I teach illustrator in class and we just never get that far.",
    "With the with some of the designs.",
    "OK, so right now let's take a look at the size of this document.",
    "No rulers show rulers, Huh?",
    "And uh.",
    "That is, let's go with interest.",
    "Boom boom boom it's 11 by 8 size.",
    "Let's fix that.",
    "Boom boom Oh yeah 11 by in 1/2.",
    "I want it to be.",
    "I need a different size, let's see.",
    "8 three and let's see, let's go with a 3.",
    "I still is not that much, huh?",
    "Is 16 by 11.",
    "Letter is 11 by 8.",
    "Well, let's see hey 3.",
    "Very girls.",
    "Phone.",
    "Made it bigger.",
    "Not going to use this background right now, I am going to clean up this right here.",
    "Get rid of that.",
    "OK.",
    "Click and drag across the whole thing.",
    "Hold down the shift key.",
    "Let's go with that.",
    "Uh-huh For those of you who gonna want prints or T shirts, I am adjusting my artwork.",
    "Every goal, bam.",
    "That's done, turn that back on this fix that.",
    "Disconnect that.",
    "And you know.",
    "Do that boom boom boom?",
    "An if I go like this, who knows about?",
    "Some of these tricks and illustrator and Illustrator.",
    "Yep.",
    "I'm not getting all right.",
    "Let's get rid of that.",
    "Not getting what I want, so I'm gonna redraw it.",
    "So like illustrator, listen Adobe.",
    "Why are you doing this to me?",
    "Although I don't, I don't mind that green.",
    "Nice.",
    "Noise.",
    "Downtown downtown.",
    "OK, very cool boom.",
    "Here we go and.",
    "I'm just drawing stuff, I'm just drawing stuff.",
    "Hum a.",
    "Am I didn't work.",
    "Alt, then click and drag.",
    "Who is the wrong button?",
    "This all button alright fine.",
    "I'll make a new one.",
    "How can I do it?",
    "Yes.",
    "And.",
    "Let's go like this.",
    "Hold down shift.",
    "Erica Phone love it.",
    "Yes, Alright, That's my background controllers to save.",
    "Who?",
    "Alright, next we're gonna open.",
    "Let's get the other deska this got thin.",
    "Right here.",
    "Then five is it 5 I think it was fire.",
    "There it is.",
    "It's all vectors, of course.",
    "I gotta clean it up, so let's get rid of that goodbye.",
    "Just get rid of that.",
    "This one I'm not going to separate like I did the other one.",
    "Was actually plantain going simple?",
    "With this design.",
    "And then if I went to spend all the time, well, you know what, I'm gonna.",
    "Yeah, Yeah, 'cause There's not editing that.",
    "I need to do here.",
    "I was going to say if I need to add or take away.",
    "We'll see how it works.",
    "Ha ha.",
    "Getting rid of all this clipping paths.",
    "Later.",
    "Hello.",
    "There we go.",
    "Oh yeah.",
    "How to clip in mass?",
    "And now that we're done, look at that boom back their points.",
    "Vector points.",
    "Back their points carried on my answer your question a second, but do you see this alright so?",
    "Now I'm going to clean this up a little bit more.",
    "I got some more work to do with this piece.",
    "All right.",
    "So the question is, why did I export as a PDF to open in illustrator?",
    "And that's because right now there is no way to sync your files from fresco into illustrator.",
    "Is coming, it's coming.",
    "In illustrator is so right now in photo shop you can see your creative cloud documents when you open photo shop on your desktop.",
    "Not available in illustrator so if you have a vector illustration like this one.",
    "And then you want to open an illustrator to play around with this some more.",
    "You can't, you can't.",
    "You can't just use the cloud.",
    "You're going to have to export out of fresco an import into illustrator.",
    "And so when you do that, you need a file type.",
    "The illustrator is going to read as vectors.",
    "And that file type is illustrator.",
    "And that's why I did what I did and there is there still little things that that keep you from making that claim.",
    "Clean transition from one program to another.",
    "And that's what I'm doing right now.",
    "Cleaning up.",
    "I'm cleaning up all of these layers so that I can have the file that the way I want it.",
    "There it is.",
    "Let's go.",
    "Does that answer the question?",
    "Is the only way that it preserves you layers?",
    "Yes, that's right, that's the only way that it preserves all of these layers as vector.",
    "The only way.",
    "Boom, now before I move this over to the other document, let me save Asan.",
    "We gotta save it now as an illustrator file.",
    "Huh?",
    "Now eventually you'll be able to move files through the creative cloud into illustrator.",
    "And that's coming.",
    "I'm actually going to be testing that ha ha very soon.",
    "Alright, so let's lock some of these layers.",
    "Unlock this want to see?",
    "Oh yeah, that's the Orange.",
    "So what I want is this one.",
    "No where is it?",
    "Let me see how they go orange.",
    "There's the Orange.",
    "So this is the Orange.",
    "And watch what I'm gonna do.",
    "I'm gonna make a copy of it.",
    "Turn this one off, grab that one.",
    "And my orange is actually not all the way Orange Lissa.",
    "Get the orange color here.",
    "Then it, yeah, that's it.",
    "So we have one color and so that's the.",
    "Not the line color, but the fill color boom boom.",
    "There it is Alright COO COO COO I should make it a little darker.",
    "There we go.",
    "I like it all right now that I have that.",
    "So that's a FF55, OK?",
    "FF 55.",
    "Gradient boom.",
    "FF 55 boom.",
    "Look at that.",
    "Is that the only way?",
    "Yes I kangaroo.",
    "Can Kendrick kangaroo can jump higher than the Empire State building?",
    "Yes again.",
    "So now I added a gradient to the inside of the eyes in the mouth.",
    "Awesome is not perfect yet.",
    "Let me see.",
    "Wrong angle, so let's go with the right there.",
    "Here it is now.",
    "It's kind of coming off like that.",
    "You see now we're going to start to add a little bit of gradients into these layers so that we can get the effect that we want.",
    "And in the drawing and not look so harsh.",
    "And unless we fix this, the lighting.",
    "There we go because the lighting keeps changing because of the outside.",
    "OK, OK, OK, so let's do.",
    "Let's go ahead and move this artwork out 'cause we need it out.",
    "Let's move that out the way goodbye boom, skull.",
    "Save this save it's well it's saving let's put these.",
    "Colors away.",
    "Is done saving OK.",
    "Select the layer control C for copy.",
    "Now I have set my pace remembers layers is right there on the screen.",
    "Paste remembers layers on so I can go over here.",
    "Everything is locked up.",
    "Control V to paste and there it is boom I just brought that artwork an it's full layers the way I organized it into this document.",
    "Kendrick, that's funny.",
    "Yeah, that's right.",
    "It depends on the size of the kangaroo and the size of the Empire State Building all right.",
    "I'm sorry I had to leave.",
    "Let me turn this back on over here.",
    "Layers.",
    "Boom, I had a meeting that I forgot all about this crazy 'cause it jumped on line.",
    "I wanted to just draw a little bit and it turned into this big thing and I had to just step away for a second and in case we're back.",
    "So far we moved one illustration in illustrator to another document.",
    "This one I'm going to turn the opacity down on.",
    "There we go.",
    "Look at that.",
    "This kind of faded in the background a little bit.",
    "Uhm, I do have different parts of the skull in different lines in different layers, so this layer what I wanted to do is give it an outline, a very thin outline, so make it thicker.",
    "Yeah, yeah Yeah, but needs to be all white.",
    "Here we go.",
    "Every girls yeah.",
    "So now is a little thicker, maybe little thicker than that.",
    "Uh-huh I did a more dramatic, so that's good and it's too big.",
    "Just go here.",
    "Oh, I don't feel like that's enough, but.",
    "Is going to be.",
    "You know what I got it?",
    "OK cool, so that's that with that.",
    "Next layer.",
    "Box.",
    "Boom, bring that in a little bit ago.",
    "There you go.",
    "Let's see.",
    "There it is.",
    "Grab those two things.",
    "Pat Pathfinder.",
    "Love it.",
    "A white turn that off give me a 2.",
    "Or a 3?",
    "There it is good.",
    "The skulls opacity is at 50, so we're going to do this one at 50 also.",
    "And.",
    "Not only that.",
    "This is the layer where I'm going to add a few things, so let's go with that guitar text.",
    "Click and it's going to say.",
    "Let me type that in.",
    "We got audio, make sure that our audio is working.",
    "This is the layer of it.",
    "Oh yeah.",
    "OK.",
    "I'm going to type draw daily or our life.",
    "Our life is our life.",
    "Come on can I type please art life and now?",
    "Got too many things on my desk trying to clean it up soon.",
    "Uh-huh Let's see every going boom our life.",
    "And it's going to be white.",
    "Or let's do white outline.",
    "Here we come.",
    "Our life.",
    "And dumb.",
    "Hum.",
    "I don't like this poster size.",
    "I see what are bored.",
    "What do we got our board 83.",
    "Inches 16.",
    "By 11 so let's go with.",
    "This with his 24.",
    "And this is going to be 24 by 1624 by 24 by 16 years I guess.",
    "Taking a poster size is there we go?",
    "Did that.",
    "I need more room.",
    "Let's see if we can make it happen.",
    "Yes we can.",
    "Hum.",
    "Uh-huh Screw up a little.",
    "To the right a little.",
    "Slow.",
    "Turn off the back.",
    "Move.",
    "Oh girl over.",
    "The shadow needs to move.",
    "There we go.",
    "No.",
    "Orcas S on the top moved there right there.",
    "Are you dumb?",
    "Hum.",
    "Test done.",
    "The skull.",
    "Just put it over there.",
    "And lock it.",
    "And now we move this over.",
    "See so we can see it art life.",
