    "Wait a minute or two.",
    "To get some people in Jack.",
    "Welcome Jack happy Monday.",
    "Thanks for joining.",
    "Just finishing getting set up here.",
    "Happy to see you hope you had a great weekend.",
    "You could start to the week.",
    "I'm having a pretty good day so far.",
    "Um, been looking forward to streaming I.",
    "I guess I've been off since.",
    "Wednesday I stream for awhile on Friday, but had some technical difficulties.",
    "But happy to be back, I will look forward to the second kind of pumped up from.",
    "From this so well, but yeah, good day at work.",
    "Had a good dinner, will barbecue.",
    "Um?",
    "Yeah, I'm looking forward to getting to work on some vectors.",
    "Tonight's.",
    "Alright, I think I'm going my done everything done.",
    "Yeah, OK.",
    "Looking pretty good.",
    "Very cool so tonight I wanted to start.",
    "Vectoring up.",
    "A sketch related yesterday that's very large.",
    "Shrink this down.",
    "So I've been.",
    "Spending a little more time with the.",
    "Adobe fresco beta.",
    "Uh, but then one of the holdouts who has had a hard time transitioning from.",
    "Adobe Photoshop sketch over to fresco.",
    "And the main reason for that is that Adobe Sketch has these fantastic shape guide so that you can trace with like a pencil's.",
    "If you have like a ruler on paper or a circle template, you can trace around it with your pencil tool and just get like pencil sketch lines of different shapes of polygons, rectangles, circles.",
    "They even have starzan like French curves, and for the type of sketching that I do ahead of coming into illustrator for vector work.",
    "That was amazing and I got really excited about fresco when it came out and it didn't have those tools.",
    "Although the ruler did come out.",
    "Uh.",
    "The ruler did come out.",
    "I think in the last public release, but they have assured us that shape guides are coming and sure enough, in the beta shape guides are there and that's how I got these.",
    "Like really straight lines and then circles.",
    "Is that the templates are there?",
    "Um?",
    "And I can't wait to start streaming that because I feel like my process for doing this is maybe a little too finicky and I should spend less time sketching and more time.",
    "Doing this vector stuff, I don't know.",
    "It's kind of fun.",
    "The other thing about most of the work that I do, this one this drawing kind of breaks that, but most of the stuff I do is usually very symmetrical like this character's head is symmetrical and both in Frisco and in Adobe Photoshop sketch.",
    "I would like draw and I copy it, flip it, move it into place, and I would have like I usually have a red vertical line down the center of a sketch so that I can kind of nowhere.",
    "That Central Line is, so it's not perfect everything.",
    "It would just be like you were drawing it on paper and somehow copying things over so.",
    "Tonight since I finally got the plugin from astute for symmetry, I'll try that out with this sketch for doing the this character's head and we can see how how that plugin works, but illustrator an iPad does have symmetry, we just can't stream that yet, so.",
    "We'll have to.",
    "We'll have to stick with this for now.",
    "But any rate I am excited to get this started.",
    "So as I mentioned, this sketchy did yesterday in Adobe fresco.",
    "And my workflow is usually to do that and I use I treat Photoshop, sketch or fresco as a.",
    "As my sketchbook and it's all where do roughs.",
    "I'm very rarely do anything high Fidelity there, and then I'll move into illustrator.",
    "So yes, Jack, I do have an iPad pro and and I am in the beta.",
    "For that and.",
    "I am so excited about illustrator, an iPad.",
    "I can't wait for more people to see it and I'm glad that that adobes teasing it out a little bit more.",
    "An opening up the beta.",
    "It's so good, so so good I am I have been dreaming of this since the iPad and the pencil first came out like as soon as the pencil came out.",
    "I was like awesome.",
    "Now I need illustrator on my iPad and so this year for all the terrible things that have happened in 2020.",
    "The one positive thing I can point to is illustrator on iPad and so.",
    "That's been that's been really good.",
    "And actually I don't know where to find it, but in the latest little trailer video they did for illustrated on iPad, one of my sketches in that and they had an animator animate.",
    "The drawing that I did in illustrator.",
    "I'll have to find that I don't.",
    "Let me see.",
    "Make sure the slack window isn't popping up where it doesn't need to be, which is right where it is.",
    "Oh weird.",
    "Let's see if I can find.",
    "7:00 PM here.",
    "Not a lot of screen real estate on my desktop.",
    "It's hard to get to this stuff.",
    "OK.",
    "This OK here it is need download it.",
    "View all downloads.",
    "All right, oh that's annoying.",
    "OK, hold on.",
    "All right, so this is the oh that's awesome Jack here in the video to that Sweet.",
    "So I did this sketch.",
    "This was the first experiment that I did with illustrated iPad a couple of months ago.",
    "This little guy and.",
    "This was like the first time I was playing with the like the grid to create these repeating lines and the repeat in his beard.",
    "And then actually, I think for these rectangular lines as well in the rainbow.",
    "And so I said this in this is the animation I want to know who the animator was who made my artwork come to life because they did such a good job.",
    "Oh, where are you?",
    "Come back.",
    "I just exported you.",
    "Find.",
    "I think.",
    "The author is.",
    "OK.",
    "And make it a little smaller so we can see it.",
    "So this animator brought my work to life in a way that I'd never even thought about.",
    "It is so cool.",
    "Really, Jack, you're saying You Think Wayne did those animations?",
    "Oh my goodness, I have to send him some fan letters.",
    "He just kept referring to the animator.",
    "So that's incredible.",
    "But I love this.",
    "I had never thought about so much.",
    "My style is very geometric and almost like rigid and this became fluid an fund.",
    "And so I want to.",
    "This is inspired me to do more animation and try and get more comfortable with that because I think this is just so cool.",
    "Oh, that is awesome.",
    "I need to talk to Wayne.",
    "This is creativity at the next level like I'm so in awe of people who can take a static image and have it moving this way.",
    "So yes, so who knows?",
    "Maybe I'll end up animating this one.",
    "Um?",
    "But I think you know when you look at where we are with fresco an with.",
    "Illustrator on the iPad.",
    "An with Photoshop on the iPad.",
    "We're really getting to that point where you can be truly mobile.",
    "And still feel like you have like a full powered creative suite like the next thing we're going to want is probably some kind of motion tool, but will get there.",
    "We will get there.",
    "Alright, so tonight what I want to do is start to vector create all the vectors for this character.",
    "The other thing I wanted to do was try out this plugin from astute graphics.",
    "Where is it?",
    "Somewhere around here.",
    "I bought I got all of them.",
    "I don't want to open all of them.",
    "Tell Mira me.",
    "So there's an astute graphics plugin called Mirror me which should give me the symmetry tools that I need so that I don't have to manually create symmetry and though so normally what I do is like I said draw the shape.",
    "Make a copy of it.",
    "Flip it horizontally, drag it into place and just keeps entering everything to try and keep it symmetrical.",
    "But this mirror me tool much like the symmetry tool in illustrator.",
    "An iPad should do a lot of this for me so.",
    "Without further ado.",
    "Let's make stuff.",
    "I'm going to show my layers panel.",
    "I'm going to rename this the Skype.",
    "And then I'm just going to drop the Opacity on it a little bit.",
    "Maybe by selecting it first would be a better way to do it.",
    "All right?",
    "And Oh, and also set the one mode to multiply.",
    "And I'll leave.",
    "This is my top most layer, but I'm going to lock it first so I don't move it around.",
    "And below it I'll create a layer or my outline.",
    "And then I'll type it again so that I spell it properly.",
    "All right?",
    "So I'm really eager to try this mirror be tool, so I'm going to.",
    "Start working on this face first.",
    "Even though I've already done the sketch most of the time these character illustrations that I do.",
    "Start out with the face and then I just figure out what.",
    "What's going to go on with it?",
    "and I was watching the movie over the weekend that had skateboarders in it and I thought it would be fun to do a scape themed.",
    "Sketch, so I'm just going to start.",
    "Drawing some shapes.",
    "It is always if you are here, you're hanging out in the chat.",
    "I would love to know who you are, what you're up to.",
    "If you have questions or suggestions.",
    "I would love to hear him.",
    "I will do my best to answer questions.",
    "And we should have the time.",
    "Right, so there's and I.",
    "My goal for tonight will be to get this all.",
    "Vectored up and then pick a color scheme for it, maybe something kind of red and 80s.",
    "Some neons.",
    "And.",
    "After that, this one I'd actually like to bring some texture and so I don't know that I'll get to.",
    "Moving over to photo shop tonight, but that'll probably be where I go next.",
    "Turn of- almost snapping for now.",
    "Now be welcome.",
    "I'm not going to worry about the spiritual just yet, so go to transform.",
    "And flip it vertically.",
    "And then just drag this one into place.",
    "In groupies.",
    "About that position.",
    "They're not super worried about following the illustration exactly.",
    "I think there's a lot of places.",
    "Um?",
    "Where I can improve what I've done so far, but I usually try and stick relatively close.",
    "OK, so the next thing I'm going to do?",
    "Will do the head shape, but I'm actually going to cut it in half 'cause I really want to put this mirror symmetry tool through its paces, so I'm going to do this, but I'm going to split this in half.",
    "Sometimes you gotta experiment.",
    "Alright, send this to the back.",
    "And I'm just going to get rid of this points.",
    "And then I'll join these two together.",
    "And then I've got half a face.",
    "Also want to create.",
    "The shape right here.",
    "Maybe make it a little rounder.",
    "So.",
    "This.",
    "And this is going to come around.",
    "But first I'm going to just hide that and fix my curve a little bit.",
    "Alright, so that done.",
    "I'm going to make a copy of this face shape.",
    "And then select that new shape I just created another use the intersect tool to get the middle of it.",
    "Said that Oh, and then I should also create this year.",
    "Make a rectangle and then rotate it.",
    "It's a little more rotation.",
    "So interesting to me how?",
    "Discord is growing in popularity.",
    "I joined it.",
    "A while back and I never I didn't use it much because the communities that I joined were pretty quiet, but now it feels like.",
    "This chords are all over the place.",
    "I definitely would be out of my element, though I think in a guitar discord I can play, but.",
    "Definitely not very well.",
    "OK, so now I'll select that head shape and this year and Unite them.",
    "He simply Nightshade Mode in the Pathfinder palette.",
    "Window.",
    "Alright, so now I'm finally at a point where I can test out this mirroring extension, so I'm going to group all of these things and then I've got this palette right here.",
    "So this is called Mirror Me For those who have joined since I first started chatting at the beginning of this dream, I.",
    "Do a lot of symmetrical work in my.",
    "Character design at most of my illustrations.",
    "And that you should requires a lot of copying and flipping and constantly censoring things to make sure that everything is symmetrical in the lines.",
    "There are some tools than you.",
    "Illustrator, an iPad included that have symmetry functionality built into it, but so far illustrator on the desktop does not have that, and so Luckily there is a company called astute graphics who make a suite of really fantastic plugins for illustrator.",
    "Here is the website.",
    "And they're on a subscription model, so it you sign up for $119 and you get a years worth of support for your plugins.",
    "After that year you could cancel and you can keep the plugins that you had.",
    "You just can't upgrade them.",
    "Otherwise.",
    "It's like a yearly yearly subscription, but the plugin that is most important to me is.",
    "Uh, let's Scroll down here.",
    "Where are you should be front and center.",
    "Marry me.",
    "So it says apply symmetry to a layer or selection, so I probably could've started working with symmetry turned on.",
    "That might have been better.",
    "Will try it both ways.",
    "Learn more.",
    "Yeah, we're cool with cookies, so this will allow you to draw and easily creates symmetrical art work.",
    "So that's super awesome if you create mandalas like I do with characters like, this would make it so much faster because normally I would do that all also manually, because I apparently like to punish myself.",
    "But anyway, let's give this a shot.",
    "And see if we can figure out.",
    "How to use this wonderful plugin from astute?",
    "Alright, so I'm going to first try this on a selection and then maybe will hide this and just try to recreate like an eye with symmetry turned on a layer.",
    "So if I mouse over.",
    "These buttons in the mirror me panel.",
    "I have one 4.",
    "Symmetry axis will affect selected artwork only, so that's probably what I want here and then.",
    "A button for.",
    "Symmetry axes will affect entire layer an be retained so that I could have done at the beginning.",
    "I think on the layer.",
    "What else here so I can select an X&AY?",
    "I can set an angle and the number of axes that I want.",
    "Fascinating, OK, cool cool.",
    "So I think what I'm going to want is.",
    "Uh.",
    "90 degrees.",
    "Wait, now you're in a coffee discord, Anna cars discord.",
    "That is super awesome.",
    "I love that you have varied.",
    "Very discord content.",
    "I think mine are all.",
    "Minor, either Twitch Streamers or like creative stuff.",
    "So I like in illustrator.",
    "Want to shuffle on some be head streamers and Twitch Streamers.",
    "Very very narrow in my in my discord experience.",
    "But yes, now I definitely do I punish myself.",
    "I think I create a lot more work then it's always necessary.",
    "Ha, but such is Life Alright.",
    "I think I only need 1 axis because I just want to flip this.",
    "Like over the Y axis, so just be the one but will turn on a few more and just see also what that looks like.",
    "I have one channel for every hobby that keeps me saying see now about that is very smart.",
    "If I could limit one channel per hobby that would keep me a lot more focus, but I also have slack to contend with because some communities are on slack and summer on discord.",
    "I don't know.",
    "But you said so you have a chocolate bar for later.",
    "What kind of chocolate bar do you have mouth?",
    "I haven't done something I need to do full oh what was that?",
    "Oh my oh check this out check this out.",
    "Alright, so I just needed to click on the canvas and here is that symmetry tool in action.",
    "So as I'm dragging this.",
    "This is allowing me to choose where I want that Y axis to be placed and when I get to the actual line of the selection it's snapping, which is kind of nice.",
    "This is exciting.",
    "Super super exciting.",
    "OK, so that's great.",
    "Let's click right here.",
    "Will say apply the selection.",
    "Oh boy, Oh yeah, I don't want it again.",
    "Just the one time school settled.",
    "OK, now now.",
    "Oh my cancel.",
    "OK, I think I just need to get off this tool.",
    "There we go alright.",
    "So just like that I got a mirrored version of my artwork.",
    "It is one.",
    "Let's see what the layers look like now that it's created that mirror.",
    "So I have a group.",
    "An inside of that group I have.",
    "The individual looks like I have some.",
    "Some errant shapes inherently, you don't need him.",
    "So it created.",
    "It grouped those teardrops it didn't group.",
    "The Lightning Bolt eyebrows, but that's cool.",
    "Uh, what else it grouped together?",
    "Oh it into one path that combines those two separate shapes.",
    "The eyes it grouped and then the head.",
    "It turned into one path, so that is super super awesome.",
    "Just quickly, the other thing I want to try now that we've seen that work is let's lock this and turn the layer off.",
    "Let's start a layer off by turning on symmetry and just see.",
    "Just see how that works, so I'll.",
    "Select symmetry.",
    "Looks like I have to still tell it where I want that access to be.",
    "Will say applied a layer.",
    "And now let's try.",
    "Straight drying and see what happens.",
    "So I gotta remember which side I first started.",
    "The symmetry on so this time instead of starting on the left side, I think I started it.",
    "On the right side.",
    "So start drawing this.",
    "Eyebrow.",
    "And that's kind of cool.",
    "You can see now with this mirror me plug in applied to the layer.",
    "Now I'm actually drawing with symmetry.",
    "So that is awesome.",
    "I am very psyched about this.",
    "Let me drop this down.",
    "I'm just going to say if this works so that I don't crash and lose it.",
    "OK.",
    "So the other thing, just as an example, now that we have that.",
    "That head shape created.",
    "I'm just going to turn it off this layer 'cause we don't have the usual amount of symmetry.",
    "I would normally have.",
    "So just turn that of- going to turn my outline back on and unlock it, and actually will make a copy.",
    "And just hide the original.",
    "And let's turn the sketch off and just play with this symmetry.",
    "Plug in for a second.",
    "So we got this like weird little character.",
    "I'll make him a little smaller.",
    "Let's say I wanted to use him as the basis for a mandala.",
    "I want to see now how this plugin works.",
    "So if I say.",
    "The number of axes is going to be pen.",
    "And I choose.",
    "This symmetry tool again.",
    "It starts to apply symmetry based on where.",
    "Where I'm clicking in relation to this character.",
    "So the closer I am to the character, the smaller the images.",
    "If I start to drag up.",
    "It's starting to mirror that outwards, which is amazing.",
    "All right click that and say apply to selection.",
    "And then let's just grab this tool.",
    "OK, OK, now now we're doing something.",
    "This is amazing.",
    "So just like that with this symmetry tool with the mirror me plugin from Stu graphics, I've got this little weird character head.",
    "Duplicated a bunch of times all around an axis that I've defined in the plug in, so I had 10 different axes in this so it was mirroring along each of those, so I should have 20.",
    "20 heads here, but if you're creating a mandala piece like Oh my goodness this would save you so much time and I wish I had known about this sooner.",
    "Regrets, but I know about it now.",
    "You know about it now.",
    "If you are curious about astute graphics, I would drop a link in chat for this plugin.",
    "I'll do that right now.",
    "Ccgraphics.com/plugins/mirrorme So I hope you found that as awesome as I did that kind of made my day.",
    "Is link.",
    "That's super cool.",
    "OK, I'm I'm really happy.",
    "That was awesome.",
    "Let's hide that layer.",
    "We can turn it of-.",
    "Actually, I guess we can delete it because it's not a piece of this drawing.",
    "Will turn my sketch back on my character outline.",
    "And get back to oops.",
    "So I have a few different keyboards in front of it.",
    "I keep tapping the round ones at tradition throat cut so.",
    "It's a great night, alright.",
    "I'm going to turn that mirror me plugin off now.",
    "And get back to work on the character.",
    "I suppose I could have actually done all of these with that, but.",
    "Ha such is.",
    "My workflow.",
    "OK, let's create this mouth.",
    "So all I do love all.",
    "Kind of all aspects of creating digital art.",
    "I do have to say that.",
    "Taking a sketch that I've done like this and.",
    "Turning it into vectors is.",
    "Is probably my favorite thing to do.",
    "That's why I love illustrator so much.",
    "Why I'm so jazzed about illustrator on iPad?",
    "These are good times to be using design tools.",
    "All right?",
    "Create the intersection there to grab my little tongue shape and then I want my teeth move.",
    "These teeth should have been mirrored.",
    "It's OK.",
    "Feel little spoiled with it with that plugin.",
    "Now I want to use it all the time.",
    "So I want the Magic to be there every time.",
    "So we get to keep this one simple.",
    "And.",
    "That is looking good for those.",
    "She makes a copy of.",
    "That mouth shape again.",
    "And scrub the intersection.",
    "Of it, she would get my teeth.",
    "So that's my mouth.",
    "No.",
    "Cool.",
    "The other thing I wanted to do with this one actually while I'm here.",
    "I thought it might be fun too.",
    "Create some false dimensionality in this.",
    "In this in this drawing as well, and so, rather than this time bringing it into cinema 40, I think I'm going to add a few elements that are that have a little more volume and then.",
    "With shading and highlights will get into that in photo shop.",
    "Maybe tonight, but more likely on Wednesday in the next stream.",
    "But at any rate, I would like to like to do that.",
    "I find I don't do enough.",
    "Uh.",
    "Enough of that, like death work in Photoshop, so I'd like to practice it.",
    "OK, so I'm just going to merge these two shapes.",
    "Whoa, that's a lot hold on hold on now.",
    "Oh, I guess that's OK.",
    "Threat to the back little bit of false volume around the mouth sucking sound like a little two mouth.",
    "And I don't really want this stripe, I don't think.",
    "In the middle.",
    "Might think about that, so I'll leave it for now.",
    "Zoom in a little.",
    "It's a group of these pieces of the mouth.",
    "Groups Ray to add.",
    "Welcome to the chat.",
    "If I don't know if I was pronouncing your name correctly.",
    "I'm sorry if I if I miss pronounce, but thank you for joining us is great to see you.",
    "I hope you're having a great Monday or Tuesday, depending on where you are in the world.",
    "I definitely am having fun working on this vector.",
    "Will character.",
    "Alright, that's We gotta face, that's a face right there.",
    "Awesome, OK now.",
    "But I want to work on next.",
    "Because I'll do the rest of the body and then move into the.",
    "Into the.",
    "Skip.",
    "So grab the Polygon tool.",
    "To buy something is stuck.",
    "Can't get out of the zoom tool.",
    "So the keyboard.",
    "There we go, kind of.",
    "Among Black Raider asks is that for beginners?",
    "Not sure what you're asking.",
    "If you're asking about the.",
    "About illustrator or about something else if you can.",
    "Clarify your question a little bit.",
    "That would be a big help.",
    "Would appreciate it.",
    "Just making this leave now for my little character.",
    "Can I get rid of this point?",
    "And.",
    "Not really the way I wanted to do that.",
    "Student.",
    "Now get rid of this point.",
    "What is?",
    "Oh, of course.",
    "Oh boy oh boy.",
    "Alright, so now I have a right.",
    "Right angle an.",
    "We've got Molly.",
    "Molly in the chat welcome Molly.",
    "Thanks for stopping by, I appreciate it.",
    "I'm going to flip this.",
    "Starting to feel like I need to find some new.",
    "New music for the stream.",
    "These lo fi beats, Sir.",
    "A little bit like lullaby eyes.",
    "Yeah, Molly Gotta bring the sound effects we've got.",
    "Gotta do whatever we can do to bring the people to the stream.",
    "So working on lots of little stream improvements, the first thing is sound effects us.",
    "Easiest thing I can do.",
    "That way I can tell jokes and have a laugh track so people will actually think I'm funny.",
    "So I can say things and and everybody laughs and I feel better about myself.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Thank you.",
    "I'm all about gimmicks.",
    "Alright, so.",
    "Got my little sleeve going from a little skater character.",
    "It's not quite where I want it yet, but let's get it in the right position.",
    "I've been.",
    "Yes, Jack, you'd need everybody needs a laugh.",
    "Track it.",
    "It is very motivational, makes you feel good.",
    "You feel way funnier than you are in real life it's.",
    "It's changing things for me.",
    "Um?",
    "I so there's a Twitch streamer that I watch who is super super creative and has like a room that's a green screen and does all kinds of like crazy effects like overlays like snap camera like snap Cam stuff.",
    "And there's all these crazy dance videos and it's so artistic and I thought that not only do our streams give us this opportunity to share our work, but can also allow us to.",
    "To have a little fun in like really bring out more of personalities and just have as much fun as with this as we can.",
    "It's it's kind of awesome that you know we can connect with people in this way, so why not?",
    "Why not have people laughing at you while you're connecting with them?",
    "That's how I think.",
    "I don't know if that makes any sense.",
    "But Had a long day and it makes sense to me.",
    "Hello.",
    "Alright, I'm going to draw the arm.",
    "I'll do the finger is next.",
    "So do the arm found here.",
    "Right now I'm going to make some fingers for this little guy.",
    "Around the fingertips.",
    "And decide on an angle.",
    "I think I may adjust it slightly from what I did originally.",
    "And make some copies.",
    "And actually, I'm going to extend.",
    "Out just a little bit.",
    "Good, I'm glad it makes sense now as long as it makes sense to somebody.",
    "Then I feel validated.",
    "That's all I need.",
    "Alright, I'm just going to connect this point.",
    "Still very cute dog under my desk for those who've been wondering.",
    "Who is hiding from?",
    "Potential fireworks That still seems to be going off in her neighborhood.",
    "So now he's getting some air pods.",
    "Alright, we'll get to the tattoos for this character later because I might want to do something a little different.",
    "Same thing with the art on the skate deck.",
    "Not entirely sure that that's That's what I'm going to want.",
    "In the end, so group this arm.",
    "All right now with again with most of the most of the characters that I do their very geometric and in this case I really hold on to that.",
    "So the body is actually made up of just a couple of.",
    "Um circles I feel like now that I've unlocked this mirror me plug in that the next stream we should maybe do a character, Metallica's.",
    "I have not done one in quite awhile.",
    "Did I just?",
    "So is anyone watching anything?",
    "Fun on TV.",
    "Any new shows to binge.",
    "Now says our mine hides two under the table.",
    "I love how dogs and cats think that under the table or a basket.",
    "The world is a better place.",
    "That kind of right.",
    "I agree with you.",
    "There are a lot of days that I would like to just hide under my desk.",
    "I've got a blanket under here it's I think it's probably very cozy.",
    "No hello for now I just want that to be white.",
    "Simpson back this is not white.",
    "Better and you need a black outline too.",
    "Already.",
    "Jax is my dog was legit.",
    "Snoring next to me.",
    "He snore so loud it is not even funny.",
    "That's amazing.",
    "My dog doesn't.",
    "She has like a really quiet, quiet snore.",
    "But I love dogs snore.",
    "I think it's the cutest thing.",
    "She's jacked, right?",
    "There is a sound opportunity for you.",
    "You can record your dog snoring and use that as a sound in your stream and then you can share.",
    "That's more into this.",
    "I'm just I'm full of ideas today.",
    "Hey.",
    "Right, so his pants are just a little piece of this moon shape, so I will.",
    "Just divide this up and get rid of the.",
    "Extra.",
    "Get out of that group.",
    "Send this shape back to the back.",
    "Alrighty.",
    "Valerie, welcome to the stream.",
    "Great to have you here.",
    "Thank you for joining us.",
    "Alright, I'm going to make some toes.",
    "Start with this one.",
    "Select these top two points and then use the.",
    "Corner tool.",
    "Who created those?",
    "I think I might also.",
    "I want speak now actually.",
    "Do want to join those together.",
    "So I'm going to connect these shapes so they snap together.",
    "And that's just using.",
    "I think I just have the smart guides turned on.",
    "Yep, smart guides are turned on, which makes it really easy to get your shapes aligned.",
    "Not something I always said that I'm trying to get.",
    "Better at.",
    "Alright, my legs are actually just rounded, not my legs, but the characters legs.",
    "Are just rounded rectangles.",
    "So I will create those.",
    "This round that off a little.",
    "Mouse is mine when someone bothers her, just shoots a fart at the subject, deadly and silent, and it's pretty effective, like Pok\u00e9mon attack that that is amazing.",
    "I think your dog wins for.",
    "For weird things that pets do.",
    "Hello, maybe the word gets flag sorier cracker.",
    "I have never heard the term air cracker before for farts, but I love it.",
    "That is a wonderful, wonderful word term.",
    "Well, we're taking the stream to just new levels tonight.",
    "Kind of awesome.",
    "Alright, the other leg is kind of tucked in behind the board 'cause it's bent, so I'll move it over here.",
    "I kind of wanted to knees touch just like that and that will go behind the deck.",
    "Oh, now we got Jack is laugh crying.",
    "I got fixed sounds in the stream we are just.",
    "We all over place tonight all over the place that would be better alright I'm going to round this and I'm going to construct this weird kind of bent, what shape?",
    "I've got going on, snap that in place.",
    "Move this other piece into place.",
    "Like so, and then I'm going to group.",
    "These three an Unite them using the Unite shape mode, and then I'll just grab this right most corner and round it to get the rounded piece about the food.",
    "We'll worry about some of the definition between the toes when I get to.",
    "Photo shop and into shading and more detail and so actually when I Unite this shape as well.",
    "OK, I'm going to group all of the oil.",
    "Illustrator don't crash on me, just save.",
    "All right, so we're going to select the legs.",
    "Feet and the body.",
    "And group that and make sure that is tucked into the back and then also group the arm.",
    "You zoom out.",
    "We are well underway here.",
    "We've got this weird character.",
    "Roland.",
    "Roller skate boarding.",
    "Things are going well.",
    "All right, so the tops of the skateboards are two circles, and that's going to help me dance with like figure out the width of the board is going to make this one a little bigger.",
    "Think I'm abusing the sounds now.",
    "This is, yeah, she's a master at it.",
    "Love my doggo.",
    "I love my dog too.",
    "He's a Barker, but he's good boy.",
    "Alright, so I think that'll be the bottom width of this deck.",
    "Like so.",
    "Now I've gotta kill some Mexican food.",
    "BRB, enjoy.",
    "Alright, let's start a line here.",
    "Get a simple board shape going on a snap it too.",
    "The circle.",
    "Not there.",
    "Back a little further.",
    "Get out here.",
    "Keep this line going up.",
    "Excellent.",
    "Zoom out and then just select all of those shapes and Unite them.",
    "Okie Doke It's warm in my studio tonight.",
    "I'm not sure why.",
    "But it's warm.",
    "Oh, looks like I got.",
    "My line.",
    "Off a little bit right here fact.",
    "Actually I think it can just.",
    "Remove the extra point.",
    "OK, cool.",
    "I'm going to add a little bit of thickness to the board and the way that I'll do that is just to make a copy of the deck.",
    "And kind of drag it into position.",
    "I need to make it a little shorter.",
    "So scale it down a little.",
    "That Just like that and then just to get its positioning right?",
    "I'm just going to tuck it in behind.",
    "In front of the deck and actually let's.",
    "The body.",
    "Just sent it back so we can still see it.",
    "It's looking pretty good.",
    "I think I want to.",
    "Take it down a little bit top.",
    "Like that?",
    "And then bring it out.",
    "Just like that and then I will probably just stretch it over here so that that line looks a little more complete.",
    "So I'm going to group these two pieces of my skate deck.",
    "Come and zoom in on this top he's looking, just tweak it a little.",
    "I am just pull this point out a little more.",
    "Just like that.",
    "Alright, so that gives the board a little bit of dimension.",
    "Actually looks like it should bring this part in.",
    "Different way.",
    "So I didn't watch too much TV this past weekend.",
    "We've been playing a lot of video games.",
    "In our house so I.",
    "Was playing with the latest update in Animal Crossing because now you can swim.",
    "Which is probably one of my favorite features in the previous animal crossings.",
    "It was great to get that.",
    "And then I was watching my partner play.",
    "The one of the destiny games.",
    "It was also a lot of fun.",
    "It looks like I got a little bit of A.",
    "See.",
    "Not quite what I wanted.",
    "Think well too is actually just pulled this point right in.",
    "Talk this in behind.",
    "And then I can use a curve to bring it up.",
    "Little more smoothly.",
    "OK.",
    "That is going to work for now.",
    "Cool, alright, so got the first piece of my deck and now I need to make the wheels.",
    "Checking on the Darko.",
    "All right?",
    "No.",
    "All right, I need something please some livelier.",
    "Livelier music here.",
    "The game music we had last week.",
    "See how this goes.",
    "Alright, so guess that angle just about right on the wheel and then I can just kind of manipulate.",
    "The Phillips Try and get it closer.",
    "They had it kind of like the angles that I figured out in the sketch.",
    "So I am.",
    "Definitely not skateboarder.",
    "I had a skateboard in as a kid.",
    "In the 80s I had a big kind of fishtail board and what mattered a lot more to me than actually skating was how cool the graphics were on the deck and I kind of wish I still had.",
    "I still had that skateboard.",
    "Actually this is interesting.",
    "I think I may have.",
    "See I think I might actually have a photo of this.",
    "Perhaps?",
    "Wanna see the skate deck?",
    "'cause maybe I can use the art on it as a reference for this character?",
    "All right?",
    "Give this two more seconds.",
    "Not finding it.",
    "I had hoped.",
    "So maybe kid me was in the photo Gallery here, but it's not anyway so I have Big Fishtail, skateboard had really cool graphics on it.",
    "I used to just mostly hold the board so that people could see.",
    "The.",
    "Could see the art and not my bad skating.",
    "Hey Leon, thank you for joining is great to see you happy Monday.",
    "If you're into skateboard art at all, I love Street art and so you know, skate art is kind of a natural extension of that.",
    "There is an awesome book here.",
    "It is right here.",
    "So there's an awesome book.",
    "Oh, that I like to look at for reference, called the disposable skateboard Bible.",
    "Pull this out a little bit here and it is just page after Page of awesome skate deck art.",
    "Really cool street art.",
    "Fantastic book, I found this in San Francisco at an art toy store.",
    "And just another like really, really cool source of inspiration.",
    "There's like amazing color schemes in these books, so maybe before I do the art on this deck valve, I'll take a look through this and see.",
    "See what I come up with.",
    "I hear you Leon Monday, Monday, so brutal.",
    "Part of me gets.",
    "Kind of excited to start the week.",
    "But I do find myself pretty exhausted after Mondays.",
    "Oh nice, you have that book too sweet.",
    "That's awesome.",
    "I wish Lee on that.",
    "I could say I was much more of a skateboarder.",
    "I really, I love this culture.",
    "And I like to watch people board, but it's not something.",
    "Not something that I do too much.",
    "No.",
    "Not the Monkey King store.",
    "This was, uhm.",
    "So what was it called?",
    "It was like.",
    "It was near Coit Tower was a tiny little store.",
    "I used to go there all the time when I lived in San Francisco.",
    "I'm sure the name will come to me.",
    "I'll keep keep thinking about it.",
    "But actually way back in the day, actually miss Robin Williams at that store by like minutes and always regretted that.",
    "But he apparently was a big.",
    "A big art toy fan and collected a lot of the same same sources like street art stuff.",
    "No Leon, I have never designed a deck.",
    "I've always wanted to do a skate deck or a snowboard.",
    "Never never had the opportunity.",
    "I was thinking about creating a few custom decks and selling them on my site.",
    "But I haven't done that yet either.",
    "I need to get focused on some of these projects.",
    "Leon, Have you ever Have you ever designed to deck?",
    "Something tells me that you have.",
    "Alright, just copying this curve here.",
    "Create a bar before we create.",
    "So this will back.",
    "Oh, Sweet, said Leon says, let's talk about skate deck printing, then let me know.",
    "I've done a bunch of them.",
    "Oh my goodness, yes, you and I need to connect.",
    "Oh, also get to know skateboards are OK.",
    "I guess that would make sense.",
    "Would be like the treatment that a snowboard gets.",
    "It also just seems like snowboards are expensive whereas a skate deck like just the raw materials are also cheaper.",
    "Yeah, I'll I'll get in touch with you 'cause I would love to do something.",
    "Let's do something this summer.",
    "There's a lot of kids around here too.",
    "Who are skating ultimate like longboards, mini boards?",
    "It seems to be simply the thing that kids are doing in town.",
    "I sound very old, but that's that's fine.",
    "That's just fine.",
    "All right?",
    "LMAO is back.",
    "Still hungry now you gotta get that chocolate bar.",
    "OK.",
    "Photo shop photo shop.",
    "Illustrator's really.",
    "Kind of creeping with the saves tonight.",
    "Alright, so I'm going to group.",
    "These pieces of my wheel.",
    "Selians has also snowboards are specific to writers for size and shape.",
    "Oh great points.",
    "You are you very clearly are far better versed in this than I am I have a lot to learn.",
    "Oh, that was not what I intended.",
    "Come on down.",
    "Oh, there we go.",
    "Here's what I did.",
    "Flip.",
    "Put this stuff around a little.",
    "We will get there.",
    "Mouse got the munchies, go full calf or get out now be yeah.",
    "What do we got here?",
    "Mouse says not even not even halfway filled.",
    "Now I gotta get a decaf.",
    "And chocolate.",
    "Oh, I got.",
    "I missed a lot of chat here.",
    "Gotta get look up print minimum of 10 and their cost somewhere around 200 precise.",
    "Oh wow OK.",
    "All Right, This is awesome.",
    "Thanks for a.",
    "Thanks for sharing.",
    "Alright, I this is the hydration portion of Tonight's stream.",
    "A very.",
    "Delicious smelling drink was just delivered.",
    "That's amazing.",
    "So cheers everybody.",
    "Oh, I'm going to guess that this is some kind of a rum punch.",
    "Find it.",
    "OK, OK, whatever this is, it's amazing.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Very lucky I don't have a good.",
    "I don't have a sound effect for that one.",
    "Oh no, not at all.",
    "This is this is the best I want.",
    "I want a nice lively chat this, uh.",
    "This is motivating.",
    "I have never had del Taco.",
    "How does del Taco compared to Taco Bell?",
    "Taco Bell is that's my jam.",
    "Oh my goodness, if that's all OK Leon, I.",
    "I gotta get some skate skateboard art figured out because.",
    "Those prices are right up my alley.",
    "Actually.",
    "Yeah, that'll work.",
    "OK cool, so now I'll take.",
    "This rotate it.",
    "Oh nice alright.",
    "It's run Monday.",
    "Henceforth, Mondays shall be known as rum month.",
    "Can't even talking.",
    "I've had one sip of this drink, so we're in trouble.",
    "This I'm in trouble.",
    "Alright, then, I'll just tweak the shape, I think.",
    "Del Taco is more basic but higher quality OK?",
    "Sounds sounds good.",
    "I'm not sure that we have any appear.",
    "We do have Taco Bell.",
    "There's a couple.",
    "All right, got some pretty basic.",
    "Pretty basic stuff going on here.",
    "But that will be fine.",
    "But who needs seltzer when you got when you got rum drinks?",
    "I will leave the coaster though.",
    "Rum days that see.",
    "Well done early on Mondays are now rum days.",
    "OK, so I'm going to come back to the board art, but for now that will suffice for our simple deck.",
    "Taco Bell.",
    "Lyonses Taco Bell is like donor delicious.",
    "I don't know I.",
    "I don't talk about all the time, if I could.",
    "Just that Chalupa Supreme.",
    "Is wonderful.",
    "Alright, so I want to do.",
    "Do I want to do now?",
    "Oh, for new people who joined, actually, let's take a look at the mirror view tool one more time.",
    "'cause that was fun.",
    "So I'm going to just copy this character.",
    "And start a new canvas.",
    "Anne will create a square.",
    "Wow, I'm It was trying to really is just.",
    "Kinda lagging for me tonight.",
    "Alright?",
    "Let's make this a 20 by 20.",
    "So I love to create character based mandalas.",
    "And normally, the way that I would do that would be to.",
    "You know, start out with a character.",
    "Like this, place it where I like it.",
    "I make a copy of it and rotate it.",
    "And then.",
    "And then drag it into place.",
    "And then I would make it, group it, copy it an rotate it.",
    "Mix puppy again.",
    "Rotated again.",
    "Rotate it again, and so this was the way that I was creating mandalas.",
    "It's slow, but.",
    "I didn't really know how else to do it, so when I was doing a lot of Mandala work last year and I'll show you an example here.",
    "Just so you can see the links that I was going to.",
    "And might be his profile, not the video page on the work page.",
    "So actually, let's go to the.",
    "So this mandala I created for.",
    "Hello.",
    "My windows scheduled too big.",
    "OK so I created this $1 for a show a group show in Berlin.",
    "And in order to create this, I was taking that process that I just showed you where I took a character coffee that flipped it, grouped.",
    "It made a copy of that, and rotated it.",
    "So everything was very very manual and that was fine.",
    "It definitely took a long time.",
    "This actually also did in paper, so that also took a lot of extra time.",
    "However, as I did hear that certainly not the most efficient way to work and.",
    "There have to be better ways to do it, and in the new in the new illustrated for iPads, there are symmetry tools that make this sort of work much easier, which is really exciting.",
    "But until we're able to stream those, I've been looking for other ways to do that, and so a friend reminded me of an awesome plugin called Mirror me.",
    "From the company astute graphics.",
    "And so I bought these set of Plugins.",
    "And tonight, earlier on we tried it out for the first time I want to try it again 'cause it's just fun.",
    "So I'm going to delete all of these other characters.",
    "Number one group.",
    "These two will just take this top one.",
    "So I've got this character here.",
    "Mouse says Oh my God, I love that.",
    "Looks like El Tigre from Nickelodeon oh.",
    "Lt grow is a phenomenal show.",
    "I would love to re watch that.",
    "I need to get that on the list that has to be streaming on one of the one of the networks.",
    "OK so mirror me the plug in.",
    "Works in two different ways.",
    "It'll work on artwork that you select and allow you to mirror it, but it will.",
    "Also you can.",
    "You can also tell it to mirror a particular layer, which is awesome so.",
    "Here's this character.",
    "Alright Cool Leon.",
    "Thank you for joining.",
    "Enjoy your food if we see back awesome.",
    "If not have a wonderful night.",
    "It's been great having you here.",
    "Alright, so now that I've got my character selected, I'm going to.",
    "Tell it that I want a 5 axes.",
    "That is fine.",
    "And now once I click on the tool now I can actually start to apply my work to it and you can see that we should stand.",
    "You can see that as I move the tool around, it's taking that point of the artwork and then is mirroring that and so.",
    "If I start to drag it outwards, I can start to create those mirrors of the character and that can all be manipulated by angle by the number of axes.",
    "So you can get really creative here.",
    "I'm just going to say apply to selection.",
    "And actually, let's create one that's just shapes.",
    "Let's get this thing.",
    "Take that and say apply to selection.",
    "OK, that's amazing.",
    "Now we're creating a mirror of those shapes.",
    "And we'll see it by the selection.",
    "And then let's just take a look at what we got.",
    "So now I've got this crazy abstract beginning of a mandala.",
    "With really interesting.",
    "Uh, combinations of characters.",
    "You can see the mouth coming through here.",
    "There's lots of eyes.",
    "Um?",
    "Just really cool stuff, so really fun to experiment with with plugins like this and a great way to speed up my workflow.",
    "So if you are interested I highly recommend you check out astute plugins.com and if you scroll back in the chat you'll find oh link to that site.",
    "If you are interested that is mirror me.",
    "I should start exploring more of the Plugins as well and see what else.",
    "What else is there.",
    "All right?",
    "I'm going to, I think, work on a different layer.",
    "Now for some of these background pieces.",
    "And these I want to keep also really simple so.",
    "All of these little kind of abstract clouds were created with rectangles.",
    "This woman I'll extend out.",
    "This.",
    "And just keep snapping those shapes together.",
    "And I'll just make a copy of one so that I have it for the others.",
    "But the way I've been doing uses just to Group A number of not group, but Unite the rectangles and then just round the edges so you can take it like this.",
    "This one I can pull outwards.",
    "This one I can pull inwards.",
    "That one actually want us, let's find.",
    "There.",
    "That's good, one last one.",
    "OK.",
    "Select those three and Unite them.",
    "Round the corners.",
    "That's corners.",
    "This one I think all moved back a little.",
    "Sweet.",
    "Thought it would.",
    "Hello.",
    "Grab these two points and around them.",
    "Let's go.",
    "With copy.",
    "So just looking at the time, my guess is that will finish the vector portion of this evening and then.",
    "On Wednesday's stream.",
    "Is when will move from illustrator into photo shop?",
    "And add some textures.",
    "An really bring some volume into this work that normally I don't do normally.",
    "I keep everything really flat, but I want to explore.",
    "Introducing a little more depth into.",
    "Some of my work and so.",
    "Will spend some time in photo shop.",
    "On one side.",
    "If you are newer to the stream and you're curious about my schedule, I tend to stream Mondays, Wednesdays at 8:30 PM Eastern Daylight Time.",

    "There's also some really nice texturing plugins that make things like halftones really easy.",
    "I might use those actually a little bit on Wednesdays stream because I think this work might benefit from some some halftones.",
    "And again if we go we go real ladies with this and going for some of those neons and maybe even looking at some thick outlines with this character that.",
    "Um?",

    "I agree when I think about all the time that I spent working on those mandalas, when I maybe could have invested some of that time into researching simpler ways to do that work.",
    "Like how other people were doing it, it might have saved me.",
    "A lot of time.",
    "But that's how we learn so.",
    "You know, I don't regret doing it the long way.",
    "I feel like maybe I have a better appreciation for for the tools that.",
    "That do exist.",
    "Um?",
    "But yes, sometimes we just have to go with what we know and frankly, you know, sometimes the more detailed work like doing it the long way.",
    "It can be fun, like if you have the time and you want to do it that way, then.",
    "Go for it.",
    "In these strange times, when we're all stuck indoors a lot more, sometimes the long way.",
    "Is the right way?",

    "And punch it out.",
    "OK.",
    "Nope, that wasn't all there.",
    "More clouds.",
    "Alright, let's Springs back out 'cause it's easier to work with.",
    "And put this one down.",
    "OK.",
    "Select the shapes and Unite them.",
    "Start by taking the one that will have pure rounded corners, and then we can select the rest.",
    "Cancel those corner said.",
    "Hello.",
    "Now, this can argue with that it's nice to zone out with stuff we love the sleeping more if we get more done in less time is also cool.",

    "Thunder buddy I can't get over that.",
    "That's so good.",
    "I have the worst that naming things so I always appreciate someone who.",
    "Can come up with a good name.",
    "Oh, just realizing as I do this, I should probably be dropping these.",
    "Nope, No.",
    "Send it into the back.",
    "OK.",
    "Two more to go.",
    "So maybe he's gonna need like.",
    "Thunder Bunny could be his tattoo instead of the word create.",
    "Like written, was like lightning style Thunderbolt letters.",
    "And he kinda also then is going to need like a little Bunny tail, so I'll add that in.",
    "But I love that name so much.",
    "That's so good.",
    "Mel B says I tend to customize everything that has a name, rename people all the time by accident.",
    "It's a gift and a curse will see that's good.",
    "I just don't remember.",
    "I never remember names of things.",
    "I'm terrible at remembering that sort of thing, like can't remember the names, TV shows that I watch movies that I've seen, people that I meet.",
    "That's like a real block for me and.",
    "I hate it.",
    "OK, I think that's all the stars.",
    "Yeah, OK, so let's send that background layer after the saves.",
    "Who called the Sky background?",
    "And we'll call this character.",
    "Actually, no, we won't.",
    "But now we can call it Thunder Bunny.",
    "Ice layer is Thunder Bunny.",
    "So send the Sky background to back.",
    "Let's turn the sketch off for a second.",
    "Just take a look at it.",
    "Yeah, that's cool.",
    "I like where this is headed.",
    "So yeah, Thunder Buddy is going to need a.",
    "A tale.",
    "And then a cool.",
    "Cool tattoo.",
    "I forgot that this arm.",
    "Needs to go on top of the skateboard.",
    "And then the head.",
    "And well in the nose.",
    "Need to be on the top.",
    "Cool.",
    "OK.",
    "So let's see, do we have time to do the?",
    "To do the ramp, I think we do.",
    "So turn the sketch back on.",
    "Right?",
    "Actually, this may be another great example to you, or a great opportunity to use this mirroring.",
    "Mirroring plugin.",
    "Mirror me where are you?",
    "Go.",
    "OK, so I'm going to apply this to the layer.",
    "So I just created an I only want.",
    "1 Axis and I want it to be at 90 degrees.",
    "1.",
    "There we go and then I want the line to be right.",
    "Here will say a fly to layer.",
    "Alright cool, so now.",
    "As I draw this deck.",
    "It should create the lines.",
    "So it's too far with Alan.",
    "Who actually know?",
    "You could do that this?",
    "And get this curve nice and smooth so.",
    "Put that line about here.",
    "Yeah, to hear.",
    "Stop that for 2nd just so I can tweak it.",
    "Illustrator flag in a little.",
    "Stop it down.",
    "Suck both of these points.",
    "And drop him down.",
    "How's that my Well, I am messing this up so you know what silly me back this up.",
    "This would be so much easier just to draw.",
    "A line like this, like I've been doing all along.",
    "And then.",
    "Which is select these points and make sure that the height is where I want it.",
    "And then I can just select this point and curve it.",
    "Better now you'll see that because I have the mirror me plugin turned on, this is drawing both sides of my shape at the same time, which is super awesome.",
    "So let's finish the shape here of the.",
    "Main part of this ramp.",
    "Draw this line up.",
    "Like that?",
    "And I will do the same thing here.",
    "Oh, you know what?",
    "Before we do that.",
    "Save a little bit of time.",
    "By copying.",
    "This one.",
    "And getting rid of the cells?",
    "'cause that's getting confusing and just bring this point out.",
    "Right to that center, symmetry points.",
    "And just slightly OK.",
    "So now.",
    "I can go in and finish.",
    "Just kind of closing up these shapes.",
    "Right on that line and I'll do the same thing for the inner one.",
    "Grab my pen tool and just finished drawing this one.",
    "Oh no, this one goes this way.",
    "This will be an interesting test of the tool of this plugin, so I'm going to make this shape and I'm going to want to punch it out of the second shape so.",
    "What I want to do is select first these two points and curve them.",
    "Like so and then just move this point out of the way.",
    "OK, now.",
    "Looks like this doesn't come all the way to the edge.",
    "So we'll fix that.",
    "There we go and will close up this one.",
    "There we go.",
    "OK, so now what I want to do is make a copy of the shape.",
    "And then I'll select that secondary shape and choose the intersection of them.",
    "And amazing.",
    "So that gave me the full.",
    "That didn't, that didn't affect mirror me at all.",
    "But one thing that you do see is that when I originally drew this, I was slightly off center, so I'm not totally on the canvas, so I'll have to fix that.",
    "I'll make the whole thing bigger and we go to the next part.",
    "Martin Friedman says yay, mirror, I this is I'm so excited about this plug in Montana this is I wish I'd known about it along time ago.",
    "This will change the way that I work without a doubt.",
    "What a time saver.",
    "So just now going to create these extra shapes.",
    "And finish out.",
    "The.",
    "Shape of my.",
    "Skate deck Zoom in a little.",
    "It is definitely from a processor perspective.",
    "It is definitely affecting how quickly illustrators working, but it feels like the tradeoff there.",
    "This kind of worth it.",
    "This is.",
    "Just working so much faster than.",
    "Than I'm used to.",
    "Alright, so I'm just going to.",
    "Bring this points down.",
    "So in the center point.",
    "You can make this a lot easier.",
    "Just by drawing lesson that shape in it's kind of fun to see.",
    "Like the United Tool still works.",
    "Like everything is, just it's Orcs.",
    "Very very cool.",
    "OK, so I do want to create these lives.",
    "So we'll go from here.",
    "They may end up just redoing these when we go into the texturing, but.",
    "For now.",
    "Would rather than.",
    "Just one.",
    "2.",
    "Free.",
    "Or Once a little over.",
    "Two more lines.",
    "That one.",
    "All right?",
    "So now.",
    "We can hit remove axes that removes the mirror me plugin from being active on the layer that I've been working on.",
    "And so you'll see, I'm just missing that one centerline.",
    "That I can draw in.",
    "Just like that and then we can select everything on this layer and group it and then.",
    "Get it centered.",
    "Since we were a little bit off.",
    "Looks like that one looks like right there is correct.",
    "Cool.",
    "Get that second safe.",
    "All right?",
    "So with that we have the majority of this sketch.",
    "Done, there's the little cityscape that needs to go in the background.",
    "We've started out this evening with just a simple sketch here on R base layer and worked on our character who thinks to mauby now has a name.",
    "Our characters name is Thunder Bunny.",
    "We have a few more details like I said to add in before we get into color and texturing and adding some depth and we'll get to those on Wednesday stream which will be Wednesday at 8:30 PM Eastern Daylight Time.",
    "If you're curious to keep up with the streams.",
    "I'll be posting schedules on Twitter.",
    "Be hints and Instagram so if you give me a follow there, you'll see those schedules.",
    "But the best way.",
    "The most reliable way to stay up to date this to give you follow here on be hands.",
    "If you smash that follow button you'll get a notification every time I go live and that will let you keep up with these projects.",
    "If you want to give suggestions for work that you'd like to see me, do changes or improvements that you think I could make to my work, I always love to hear that.",
    "I'm always looking to improve.",
    "Also, love to try out new tools, so if there's a tool you think I should be working with that might help my work or that you just like to see me play with with love to hear those.",
    "So again.",
    "Just really excited to connect with people and hear from you.",
    "Get to know you and make sure that I'm creating things that you're interested in and providing some value here, because this is super fun for me, but I'd like it to be.",
    "Fun and informative for you as well.",
    "So again, if you've been with me tonight these past couple hours, I want to thank you so much for spending your time with me for hanging out and chat, especially Leon, Mouse, Jack Martin.",
    "All of you have joined tonight.",
    "Thank you so much.",
    "You make it a real pleasure to hang out here and keep the chat really lively and always helping other people out and just making this a really fun place.",
    "So like I said, I'll be back on Wednesday to take this sketch to the next level will.",
    "With color schemes with state art with tattoos and texture and just keep pushing this further until then again, my social links are below in the stream description.",
    "But otherwise I want to thank all of you so so much for joining next time I also hope to have more sound effects and maybe a few more stream animations set up so we can keep the fun going.",
    "And yeah, I think I think that's it for me.",
    "Uh, once again, goodnight all and I will see you.",
    "Very very soon.",
    "I'm going to say this one more time before I lose it.",
