    "I'm going to be late to class again.",
    "I know got good reason, though I thought I had everything all ready to go and then you know, as soon as I bring it in 30 minutes before the stream I I started noticing all sorts of errors so.",
    "Quick overview what we're doing today is going to be texting this little.",
    "Sci-fi hangar door, well, let's call it.",
    "And we're going to use it as a stream transition, which I think would be kind of fun.",
    "This bad this bad boy here is going to.",
    "Yeah, nice little overlay and will animate it and do all that good stuff, but we do have a few glaring issues to fix.",
    "Most noticeably, we got some.",
    "Ron facing faces or normal is going on here rather.",
    "We got a few.",
    "Funny things here and there.",
    "It turns out that.",
    "Maybe, just maybe a little little bit of the old movies were sticking off the.",
    "Signal the edge up here.",
    "As you can see.",
    "Now we gotta fix for those.",
    "I just got that fixed going, but we do need to go back and re bake or.",
    "Or Maps so.",
    "If you just mayor with me, we're going to be doing that real quick.",
    "So we got our exploded little meshes here.",
    "In fact, I'm going to go ahead and name that.",
    "Yeah, with all makes sense in a little bit.",
    "Once I do my explaining good enough.",
    "All right?",
    "Got a nice hot high Poly mesh.",
    "I'm going to go ahead and just.",
    "But you will take a look at what that looks like.",
    "I know very nice, but it is unreasonable.",
    "For us to texture this, mostly because I don't want to be the one to unwrap it.",
    "So what we do is.",
    "We pop it down into this nice boring low Poly version with all these hard edges.",
    "All these disgusting 90 degree turns and then we.",
    "We do a few little tricks to make the I think it's rounded.",
    "Let's see what I mean.",
    "So real quick.",
    "Let's go ahead and get these exported.",
    "Preface selection and if you have done this once before, I thought I had everything sorted, but.",
    "Yes, that was not the case.",
    "But that's on me for.",
    "In all of two hours of sleep last night so.",
    "I'll make a few mistakes here and there.",
    "Sounds good.",
    "So now that we got those two experts were going to hop back over.",
    "I know we got so many programs going to actually do are.",
    "Baking in.",
    "Tool bag here.",
    "Just a little bit little bit quicker, so I'm going to do is going to get really sold meshes.",
    "They ain't right.",
    "And then we're going to.",
    "Bring in the new.",
    "Over here.",

    "At these cages.",
    "I think we're good to start with bacon.",
    "So long as I don't forget anything, I think we're good to go.",
    "Got our normal map.",
    "Now we can hop back over.",
    "Right since hop over into substance painter here.",
    "First things first, let's get this sorted.",
    "Do another new one here.",
    "We're going to grab are fixed model.",
    "And we should see I think I shuffled this one around.",
    "This little piece in the top left is going to move down.",
    "And a few other quick changes.",
    "Let's go ahead and quickly grab our normal map that we just made.",
    "The OK discard.",
    "Let's see if we get those fixes.",
    "Nope, this is the wrong one, so I'm going to go ahead and.",
    "Make sure I exported it.",
    "And tell me that I didn't.",
    "In real quick and just going to check my UPS.",
    "Is all fixed.",
    "Cool.",

    "Yes please.",
    "Better one more time.",
    "Beautiful there we go.",
    "Everything is within the lines were looking all good.",
    "Just fine.",
    "Up in our normal map.",
    "Like really funny areas we got.",
    "Oh man, we got two faces.",
    "We can fix that.",
    "We fix that easily.",
    "I was good.",
    "So I mean it ain't the Cleanest But.",
    "Top of the four K in the end of look good.",
    "Alright, we got literally two faces here that would give us problems.",
    "Which it's an easy fix, but you guys know the gel.",
    "You know how it back over?",
    "Be nice if I could tell which faces those were though.",
    "Go ahead and find the.",

    "OK, now.",
    "And a half back over going to fix those faces.",
    "So it's.",
    "Corner that is.",
    "Right here.",
    "Select that and find that.",
    "Probably these two ones.",
    "Wouldn't be.",

    "Let's see otherwise.",
    "Basically the same program.",
    "3DS Max is kind of funny.",
    "Both are owned by out of desk.",
    "But they're very similar products, and it's because.",
    "Believe Autodesk in pot 3DS Max.",
    "Which was another 3D modeling software.",
    "And.",
    "But rather than combining it with my late kept this effort because obviously people like that and I don't know.",
    "It's just where the company's got.",
    "Very similar products, but I think that's.",

    "The basic hard brush.",
    "I already know I don't like this, but.",
    "Bring up the brush choice later.",
    "Just want to see.",
    "Looking at color and shape here.",
    "Something like that though.",
    "Any confuse me so much?",
    "My first concern is like wait.",
    "So why do they have two of the same program?",
    "It was like which one am I supposed to use?",
    "Part of me wishes I went the.",
    "3DS Max grab those God.",
    "Get some nifty features.",
    "They wish my head like it's a little bit.",

    "No, my has similar properties, it's just.",
    "With the UI is and getting through it still a little different?",

    "Just keep making our own.",
    "I just painted ones can be quite harsh.",

    "Texture I know texture is one of those words.",
    "Guess Turner around a lot.",
    "We're making a texture, but we'll set the add texture, it's.",
    "It's all sorts of confusing.",

    "Want anything strange?",
    "Want anything extremists in CCC?",
    "Brings in this.",
    "It is popcorn ceiling material.",
    "Remind it.",
    "I think this is going to be the right map for us, but.",
    "Let's see if this is.",
    "I don't like the noise, but.",
    "Come there.",
    "Still.",
    "And I'm just going to find a little noise map.",
    "So what I should have done and what I almost did was.",
    "Model in the geometry so that I could just select my face is but in the end I lays it out 'cause I was like.",
    "You know what I could just hold shift.",
    "In control, and that'll draw me straight line.",
    "And we are, we don't really too worried about color.",
    "Hers, the black color working with right now is because.",
    "We we have everything set up as we can just go in and turn it into whatever we like which is really cool.",
    "So I always work with Phil layers and masks as opposed to.",
    "Just regular old layers.",
    "Regular layers are lame.",
    "They were fun.",
    "It's just, it's just thanks.",
    "Make sure actually.",
    "Get the thickness somewhere right here.",
    "You could have an outline, so along some of the.",
    "Geo here to mechanical.",
    "Speaking of.",
    "Minor gripes though, just want to have is that.",
    "I click here and then I want to shift.",
    "I can get that point, but as soon as I.",
    "Alton middle click over.",
    "It doesn't stay there.",
    "That makes sense so.",
    "You gotta do it all in one big swing.",
    "Which ain't that big of a deal.",
    "Pretty good.",
    "Is that noise is a little bit extreme.",
    "The rough metal we got going on for the finish, but.",
    "We'll come back to it, so yeah, thank you.",
    "It reminded me to save.",
    "By doing it for me, having said I have not saved yet.",
    "That way everything.",
    "Back Mr White.",
    "Different versions that would be very cool.",
    "Start bringing in the same.",
    "Styling.",
    "I'm going to want a different line thickness here though.",
    "That down to about there.",
    "Off You want the ability to hold shift and control to get these lines.",
    "I'd have to learn how to draw straight lines.",
    "The greatest thing ever.",
    "It will be a 45 degree angle.",
    "Now of course.",
    "And clean up a little bit of those edges there, but that's OK.",
    "Not today though.",
    "Game.",
    "And I think we will pop this over into.",
    "Or K for the final render here for the final export weather and the nice thing about painter here is I can work in whatever resolution I want and.",
    "When I go and switch it.",
    "I goes and recalculates everything.",
    "It doesn't do any dirty upscaling tricks, it's just it's true 4K.",
    "Sure, whatever you want.",
    "Take a guess.",
    "But if you use an AK images then.",
    "That's a big hard drives 'cause.",
    "I want everything up for just 2K.",
    "All right?",
    "You're not the sharpest lines, but.",
    "Don't look.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Yeah, I like that.",
    "Not even do it down here on this labor.",
    "First, let's go ahead and grab.",
    "It's bad boy.",
    "They relieve their annoying things are so high resolution out means more work, but also means your work doesn't get blurred out.",
    "I mean, the higher the resolution, the better I think.",
    "Yeah.",
    "As the big breakthrough, I want to see us.",
    "It's Crazy Resolution Games 'cause then.",
    "Think about how she's just so many opportunities with high resolution.",
    "I don't have to pick and choose where my.",
    "Pixel density is how you know my UV second.",
    "Everything was high res.",
    "I wouldn't have to.",
    "I don't know if it's more high res.",
    "I'll do that short, I don't mind.",
    "Most of the extra work is done by substance painter anyways, so.",
    "If that means I could be thrown down decals without having to throw down decals, I'll be.",
    "All about it.",
    "'cause a lot of times what games will do is rather than.",
    "OK, let's say I wanted to have like.",
    "A cool little bit of text somewhere.",
    "If they wanted this cool little.",
    "Digits printed on rather than going into the.",
    "Textured self and stamping that on.",
    "I will do is actually have.",
    "Gay mentions there's usually these things called decals and.",
    "It just let's them stamp him around without having to worry about.",
    "Their texture resolution.",
    "On the object printed on so.",
    "You know, so I had a.",
    "Very big spaceship and I wanted little.",
    "Little stickers everywhere with all sorts of cool at all.",
    "Details I can use.",
    "His in game projected decals as opposed to put them directly on the texture.",
    "Got her start talking like that but.",
    "And they quote me on that, right.",
    "Just just never quoting a man, he's had a.",
    "All of two hours of sleep today, so.",
    "Anything I say today is not gospel, but.",
    "Dress that I'm you know, one or percent, always accurate, never wrong, right?",
    "Probably the more work.",
    "'cause the more work is all done by painter.",
    "So I was thinking about the.",
    "Oh no, don't worry about me.",
    "I'm I've been looking forward to it.",
    "I love me some streaming.",
    "And I've been like I've been kind of interact with my modeling lately, and this one I finally broke out of that rut.",
    "So I am super excited to be textured.",
    "Something original again.",
    "I'm chilling.",
    "Look at plenty of sleep tonight, I promise.",
    "And I was thinking about the old.",
    "We could do that unreal 5 demo and they start talking about.",
    "Yeah, don't worry, no more worry about polygons, millions of polygons and I passed a man.",
    "Let's go to unwrap that bill.",
    "Like I don't think the auto in rappers have gotten good enough.",
    "The rely solely on that and what I mean by Unwrapping.",
    "I know I looked around all these cooling goes to sound cool.",
    "Basically what it is though I've got this 3D model and then I gotta go through and cut it up so everything lays flat, right?",
    "It's it's basically reverse origami.",
    "I've got this 3D thing and I make it to D and plan everything out.",
    "So if you think about like a typical cube, if you're to make a paper cube, you unfold it and it would look like this pretty much.",
    "This is, you know, if your printed out that you could fold it up.",
    "Make a cube.",
    "Same thing goes for unwrapping everything.",
    "It's just a matter of flattening everything out as cleanly as you can.",
    "An which is all good in said on these nice.",
    "Low Poly models but then.",
    "I start bringing these high Poly models.",
    "This ones got was this have.",
    "Engineer 800,000 tries, it's a lot, it's over over the soap, but having to go through and cut all the different lines, I need an unfold.",
    "It is nightmare.",
    "I don't know who's going to do that.",
    "We gotta get better unwrapping.",
    "We need some Magic AI in movies.",
    "That's what I'm going to say.",
    "Do you quote me on that one?",
    "The next big breakthrough.",
    "Not having to you face.",
    "There are some things like.",
    "I think I think my my box, which is another, my or another Autodesk program for sculpting.",
    "There's there's some sort of.",
    "Texel painting don't quote me on that one, but what it is.",
    "Basically you can paint texture without needing to unwrap and UV.",
    "And but it's very computationally expensive to do so.",
    "You can see that in any real time application, as far as I'm aware.",
    "But if they got some breakthroughs on that could be kind of.",
    "Kinda crazy though.",
    "I gotta be honest, even though I'm.",
    "Run on a tiny bit of sleep I.",
    "I feel super energized.",
    "I stop by fresh cake stream today.",
    "It was like man.",
    "Sky this kind of data stream.",
    "I thought super motivated to go in and do.",
    "There's some streaming my own.",
    "I don't know how I haven't watched more of history and so forth.",
    "This is just awesome.",
    "So good.",
    "Please don't know, fresh cake is another streamer here on be Hans.",
    "The key works mostly in Frisco, and he does these really cool.",
    "The stations you should just go check him out.",
    "I love his art style in.",
    "Some straight lines.",
    "Little thick",
    "Once see too much.",
    "X going on over here.",
    "Let's not worry about that.",
    "Messy.",
    "Little bit smaller.",
    "Then Also do is just grab.",
    "Faces down here.",
    "The screws are pretty gradients.",
    "Oh these things over here.",
    "These are.",
    "After normal map detail.",
    "Sue a boy was talking to Jordan by this other day trying to explain normal Maps without any sort of visual aid.",
    "So let's see how it can do it with some visual aid.",
    "So basically I want over this briefly at the start of the stream, but what we did is we took this.",
    "Super High Poly Model with its very nice rounded rounded edges.",
    "Beautiful curves and we took it over.",
    "To this ugly.",
    "Low Poly Model with its hard edges you know 90 degree edges, which is you know.",
    "There's no such thing, right?",
    "No such thing in real life.",
    "So they always tell me all we do is we.",
    "Do a little bit of baking to get that kind of detail.",
    "So basically what it does is.",
    "It makes it appear as if.",
    "These hard edges have the curve of the high Poly model.",
    "Based on how it draws the normals.",
    "And the normals are basically.",
    "Any given point.",
    "Let's see if I can turn on.",
    "Display.",
    "Anything whatever.",
    "This goes into more graphics engineering which.",
    "I don't know much about, but I can get by.",
    "Basically, it just tells any given pixel which way it's facing.",
    "So with that ends up doing is we make ourselves a normal map which looks like do do do do, do do do this.",
    "It's in this weird purple.",
    "Tone.",
    "Let's see why, but that's what it do, and basically these are just.",
    "In that same gradients of it, it fits in with the normal map.",
    "Is that makes sense.",
    "Give a quick demonstration even.",
    "She replied, Let's not do that.",
    "The norm happen.",
    "The heightmap or.",
    "Kind of very similar.",
    "Um?",
    "Most of the time when I'm working I convert my height into a normal map.",
    "And blend the two.",
    "I play my normal in my height, but sometimes you'll take your height map and use it to actually tessellate and push the geometry.",
    "I shut off my force material before and I did that.",
    "I don't know what happened.",
    "What's going on over here?",
    "Hum.",
    "Hey can use the heightmap to tessellate and actually push out geometry.",
    "What is the normal map is just a?",
    "This looks like that.",
    "I'm away.",
    "This is happening at three over some stuff.",
    "I should have done instead of Tangent app.",
    "I should have been on UV.",
    "That was on me.",
    "Paint just do half right, they did.",
    "Do this for peace.",
    "To her mask.",
    "Then all sorts of funny.",
    "As soon as that pink were talking about the other stream, yeah yeah.",
    "I don't know what happened to my mask.",
    "Whoever.",
    "And all these gaps everywhere, man.",
    "I wanted to do was I should've been brushing with.",
    "UV alignment on so that it doesn't.",
    "Take into account the actual.",
    "Geometry is sitting on top.",
    "I I did the full box here, I'm feel like I'm going crazy.",
    "I thought I did all this.",
    "This is cool.",
    "Thanks KIRO.",
    "Here drawing.",
    "Any questions, feel free to ask.",
    "Some questions in my own is to.",
    "Things are.",
    "Messed up, but.",
    "Remind will do it a second time.",
    "Just redo it, which is really doing man.",
    "Those lines are so nice and straight.",
    "I feel like this is the.",
    "The stream of do overs?",
    "Shell.",
    "What you doing there?",
    "I can be able to match the size, so we might as well redo it all.",
    "And we could get close enough, but.",
    "He would know.",
    "I'm going to make sure my alignment.",
    "Do is purely on UV here.",
    "We don't even rotate.",
    "You're destroying today, rain as well, right?",
    "The way I sat on the listening, I gotta check that out.",
    "Going to be honest, I got totally enamored with fresh cakes.",
    "I totally forgot.",
    "How to go?",
    "Here we go.",
    "Said just change size my brush tonight.",
    "But then you realise.",
    "That's from the Earth.",
    "So good.",
    "Play this Tammy.",
    "Who did see?",
    "Carnaval music yeah I got you I got you hold on.",
    "It's pop it out.",
    "Let's get weird 64, right?",
    "I think it's #64.",
    "Man.",
    "I don't.",
    "I feel like this is going to.",
    "To make my sleepiness like.",
    "Is going to push me over the edge.",
    "I'm losing it.",
    "Best vanity mirrors going down.",
    "Booty.",
    "They went right.",
    "I was playing.",
    "Animal Crossing They had a phonograph for sale.",
    "Now what's what's the difference between a phonograph?",
    "In the gramophone, so I looked it up.",
    "Right, I see I looked it up on my friends, look it up and.",
    "Is that the Phonograph runs on a cylinder, and the gramophone runs on a record.",
    "You know, students round record and Animal Crossing the bacon out, right?",
    "The phonograph is running on a record.",
    "That's not good.",
    "Breaking my immersion.",
    "Can't believe this is a real photograph now.",
    "At the completely wrong type of.",
    "Media playback.",
