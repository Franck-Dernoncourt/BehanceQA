    "So I did that one just to add some more contrast here.",
    "And then I also added a color balance one.",
    "So here we did, um.",
    "You can pull up your adjustments that not that one.",
    "This one so.",
    "You have your adjustment layers over here and if you click on different ones you can see the properties.",
    "So this is what I added to this and I can go back and I can change it anytime I can change it now or I wanted to, but I think it's like good where it is.",
    "So I think that's you know.",
    "Like I I I knew that you know adjustment layers existed.",
    "I just don't use them very much.",
    "I usually flatten and then edit, but I think it worked out well on this one.",
    "Since you know I'm not finished with it, I have some stuff that I want to do some cleanup on and everything, and that's what we're going to work on today.",
    "But just putting those two layers on here.",
    "Before I did any of that and then painting on top of everything like I have a better color palette now.",
    "So AM.",
    "Yeah, um, but what we're going to do today is work on doing some cleanup here.",
    "And doing some like rendering.",
    "And I mean it's like pretty far along, so I think that's pretty much all we have to do here.",
    "But thank you, Douglas.",
    "Um?",
    "So I'm trying to figure out.",
    "I just want to start painting on top of stuff, or I might want to go back in here.",
    "Um?",
    "Where the lines are and maybe just kind of clean up a few things like I know I wanted to go back on top of her hair and add that texture in here because I block everything in with.",
    "Like a lasso tool, so it's very like.",
    "Hard edged and I want to add some of that texture back in here.",
    "Yeah, I think I'm going to go.",
    "Where is my line layer?",
    "Here my lines and.",
    "I am just going to go in here.",
    "And.",
    "Clean up a little bit of this, oh.",
    "Huh?",
    "I don't have the brush their own is.",
    "So I'm going to use the sketch square brush and.",
    "Um, I'm going to hold down.",
    "The I don't know it's called.",
    "I feel like we go through this every time I stream, but for those who don't know, um, this little key with a little squiggle.",
    "Um, if you hold that down whenever you have your brushes selected then it will erase.",
    "With a brush at the same settings as you're like, Brush Alright.",
    "It will erase with the eraser that is the same setting is your brush, so it's really nice if you don't need to like.",
    "Swap over to your eraser.",
    "And you don't want to like have to go through all the eraser settings and change those.",
    "You can just.",
    "Stick with your brush that you're using.",
    "Plus I feel like erasing with the same brush that you were drawing with.",
    "Helps keep everything consistent.",
    "As far as like texture.",
    "Uhm, but the bike is on a different layer.",
    "So we're just going to kind of clean up.",
    "Some of the lines that I don't want in here.",
    "It's not really too much.",
    "Um?",
    "Sing Most of them are on her legs are here so.",
    "Try to get like a sharper line.",
    "The~ OK?",
    "Yes.",
    "I didn't know how to say it.",
    "I didn't wanna say it the Tilden.",
    "I know it for next time.",
    "Next stream when I explain it again.",
    "So right before I started streaming I got.",
    "A package in the Mail and I haven't opened it yet, but I already know what it is.",
    "Uhm, I ordered some new stickers.",
    "From sticker app and I'm really excited to open them.",
    "But I'm going to do like an unboxing video so I can't do it right now.",
    "I've been waiting for them and.",
    "I forgot they were coming today.",
    "So.",
    "That was a nice little surprise.",
    "All right?",
    "No.",
    "Well, so we want to do with the lines on the bike.",
    "Here are they.",
    "Also, something I learned pretty recently.",
    "If you hold down control and then you click.",
    "On We have to have like the move tool selected.",
    "But if you click.",
    "You can find the layer you're looking for, like really easily.",
    "This is like.",
    "There it is.",
    "That's very helpful.",
    "I hate like looking through layers and trying to find like where is this little speck that I need to erase?",
    "Probably should wear my glasses.",
    "I like, I feel like every time I start streaming I get tired.",
    "I don't know why that is.",
    "I think it's like looking at the screen for awhile, just like.",
    "Sleeping.",
    "Even though you know I just started streaming.",
    "And this is actually the first.",
    "Drawing I have done today.",
    "So I went to the post office this morning.",
    "I had a bad time, just not pleasant.",
    "Not a pleasant experience with post office.",
    "Um?",
    "Fat Kind of put me in a bad mood this morning and then had to go to the grocery store so.",
    "Fun stuff.",
    "But I'm glad to be back home.",
    "You know I have.",
    "My references on Pinterest and I forgot to pull them up.",
    "I'm going to go ahead and do that.",
    "They found that I'm drawing a bike.",
    "Definitely need a reference 'cause I do not know what I'm doing.",
    "So this.",
    "There we go.",
    "Drawing this bike because it's very cute.",
    "How come?",
    "Open right here for now.",
    "Except around I'm not making the tires white, they're going to be black tires.",
    "All right?",
    "So as far as the lines go right here, I don't think.",
    "I can really do too much too.",
    "Prove that.",
    "'cause we're just going to pay on top of it so it's OK.",
    "Uhm, I think what I'll do is start out.",
    "Um?",
    "Before I start painting, I'm actually going to add a few.",
    "Adjustment layers.",
    "Um are like blending layers.",
    "So we're going to do.",
    "Some shadows in here.",
    "I think.",
    "I don't want to add some like dappled lighting.",
    "But how about later?",
    "So we're just going to start out with like a multiply.",
    "And.",
    "I think what I'm going to do is actually erase.",
    "Out some highlights.",
    "So we're just going to try to find A.",
    "Kind of like a purple tone to contrast with, like the lighting that I'm going to have.",
    "I'm just going to like put this over top of the entire illustration and areas out.",
    "Um?",
    "Let's see.",
    "Hi, thank you Anthony.",
    "Uh, yes.",
    "I hate drawing bicycles too.",
    "I think this is the first bike I have drawn since.",
    "Uh, probably high school, so um.",
    "Yeah Oh Hi Rachel.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Yeah, um.",
    "So these up.",
    "So this is for the printing sticker club on my Patris on an once we finish this I will I order my prints from cat print now for the print Super Club is it just makes it easier so I don't have to like print them all individually.",
    "I can just make the order and then be done with it.",
    "Um?",
    "But I'll get like the proofs and for those, and then I will get up.",
    "So if I approve the proof.",
    "Then they'll send me in the.",
    "Like Finals And like all the proofs on cat print are free, so that's like really nice.",
    "I use them for like all my printing stuff.",
    "So since I put this like.",
    "On top Like this, a multiply layer on top.",
    "I'm just going to kind of erase.",
    "Out what would be in.",
    "Um?",
    "Or like what would be.",
    "You know?",
    "A highlight.",
    "I'm just kind of coming here and doing that like for the background part right now.",
    "So obviously the Sky is not going to have any shadows on it.",
    "Um, so erase all that.",
    "I saw grass over here.",
    "And then when I kind of erase.",
    "Almost like a.",
    "And glow.",
    "Playing song glow, but it's like the light is kind of like spilling over.",
    "Right here, so it's a really subtle.",
    "Highlight.",
    "I haven't exactly decided.",
    "Um?",
    "Where I went on my lighting to go yet.",
    "'cause I want her face to be like the focal point, so I don't want to completely.",
    "And shadow.",
    "So I think maybe some.",
    "Some federal highlights in here.",
    "Nothing like super bright like this.",
    "I'm in the background, but.",
    "Add a little bit.",
    "On her face.",
    "And.",
    "Will play around with some more intense highlights here in a little bit.",
    "The only bad thing about wearing glasses like I need to see the color and these are like blue light glasses.",
    "Um, so the colours aren't super accurate.",
    "It's like.",
    "Slightly yellow.",
    "Are you still shade like all of my illustrations like this?",
    "For awhile, probably like in high school and then I stopped doing it.",
    "Uhm where I erased out highlights and then more recently I've got back into it.",
    "Not really sure why I stopped.",
    "But I'm having more fun with it this way.",
    "Because using like these blending modes like this is a multiply layer like I don't have to think about.",
    "The color as much like I already have my basic like my um, basic colours down.",
    "And when I put the multiply layer on it, it adds this like.",
    "So this is what it looks like.",
    "Without the multiply layer, so is this really light purple?",
    "And then you make it multiply?",
    "It just adds a good contrast to him.",
    "Um?",
    "Which I can even go back and I can.",
    "I can change color of.",
    "The UM?",
    "Shadows if I want to.",
    "So.",
    "Just like make him really right, go crazy with the color.",
    "Right?",
    "Which Valley right here for now and you know, I can always tone it down if I want to, but for now, we're just going to keep it.",
    "Like this and then, um?",
    "We can make those adjustments.",
    "Later on.",
    "But after we lay down these shadows.",
    "And you know, do do another blending mode with some highlights in here.",
    "What I'll do is I'll paint on top of everything.",
    "And you know, sometimes I actually like.",
    "Do the shadows and stuff after I do the clean up.",
    "Then sometimes I do the.",
    "And I've certainly the shadows first like this.",
    "But I think it just kind of depends on you know how I'm feeling and how like how I want to approach it.",
    "Because when you're doing it this way, you're adding like.",
    "Different color tones in here that you can pick from whenever you are.",
    "Um, picking colors later.",
    "To clean everything up and render it.",
    "Such as kind of depends on what you want to do.",
    "And really, I could just add this stuff in and then I could hide.",
    "This and then go in and render it and then come back and this will be here.",
    "So.",
    "Well, it's like there's so many different ways you can work.",
    "When you're doing like a digital painting.",
    "I think that's like really cool about it, but.",
    "I know it can be a little daunting when you're first starting out.",
    "You don't really know like what is the right way to do this is like.",
    "I mean.",
    "You can try a bunch of different ways and then you figure out which one is the best one for you.",
    "So.",
    "Thank you.",
    "So I'm just adding the this phone.",
    "Taking away the shadows, but I'm doing it very, very lightly.",
    "Just to make it a little bit more subtle.",
    "Um?",
    "Anything that's like more intense, I'll add it.",
    "When I do my rendering.",
    "So just adding that like really subtle.",
    "These shadows little bit.",
    "Um?",
    "Just added so much contrast here.",
    "It's not done yet, but.",
    "It's like a good start and it helps you kind of see like where you want your.",
    "Waiting to go.",
    "And it's also a good way to test out different lighting situations.",
    "If you're like unsure.",
    "How you want everything to come?",
    "To be like in the end, you can just kind of do this.",
    "Try a bunch of different ways and.",
    "Um, just quickly change it if you want.",
    "Yeah, I am kind of looking at this now and I.",
    "I think I might want to go back and.",
    "Do the clean up first.",
    "So I'll just keep this here and then.",
    "Just make a new layer.",
    "Zoom in here.",
    "And this ad.",
    "Some texture to her hair.",
    "I think we'll do that first.",
    "I tend to like bounce around him, work on a bunch of different things.",
    "Shoe, I don't remember exactly which brush I used.",
    "When I did the illustration on the left.",
    "I think it was on another pencil brushes here.",
    "Probably not this one.",
    "I don't know if we're just going to play around it and see how it goes, but I also do need to add some like darker tones in her hair.",
    "I don't know.",
    "I kind of lost the contrast in here.",
    "Oh, but before I do anything else, I am going to add my value check layer.",
    "So that is where you fill a new layer like on top of everything.",
    "You fill it with white.",
    "And then you change the blending mode to color.",
    "So.",
    "Uhm, I can just kind of like check.",
    "How everything's going up and right now I'm seeing that.",
    "The color that I made the lines on her arm.",
    "They had a little bit too much contrast.",
    "Compared to her skin tone, so I think I might.",
    "A white and this line up a little bit just because it's like you look at the rest of the materials here.",
    "And there's not as much contrast in between, AH, the line and the colour like, especially down here on the bike.",
    "Like everything is kind of like cohesive like that, but.",
    "You know this this area, this area I guess on her legs to really the only part that's not the same.",
    "So this kind of helps me like this value check layer helps me see that.",
    "Um, 'cause I did like when I was looking at it like this.",
    "It was like something looks a little bit off.",
    "And not as cohesive him, it was the color that I chose right here.",
    "Put these lines.",
    "Um?",
    "And then I'm also seeing that right here.",
    "Right here.",
    "This town in this tone are very similar.",
    "In value and we want this bike to stand out more.",
    "So what we can do is go back down.",
    "To like yes.",
    "No.",
    "Trying to find the lines for the bike.",
    "Are there?",
    "I'm just going to paint on top of this clipping mask.",
    "I mean on the bike.",
    "But if you go to your eyedropper tool an you can do sample current layer.",
    "So instead of picking up this black and white and picking up all of the colors.",
    "On the bike.",
    "Where?",
    "I don't know.",
    "We want to do current layer in the one below it, 'cause this is the colour of.",
    "The bike, so I want to add some more of this color.",
    "Like right here.",
    "All right here.",
    "Turn.",
    "Yeah, so something like that.",
    "I'm probably should add.",
    "Are you so other brush?",
    "Because it's.",
    "Not really the one I wanted to use on here.",
    "Yeah, but I find doing this really helps.",
    "Like using the value check layer.",
    "'cause I can go back and look at like some of my older drawings that you know, I never even check the values and I can tell like.",
    "Um?",
    "The way that I painted them.",
    "With just with color and not paying attention to a contrast as much.",
    "I can just tell that.",
    "They just look just look a little bit off.",
    "Same thing here.",
    "With this little bike handle, I think we could.",
    "You don't have to use this right now.",
    "Because we know what we're looking at.",
    "We just want to look at this bike.",
    "Uh, the handlebars and I'm just going to.",
    "Add a little bit of.",
    "Highlight in here.",
    "On the top.",
    "So that kind of makes it stand out a little bit more.",
    "I do not know why the oranges.",
    "Are on top of the bike.",
    "Why is that?",
    "All right?",
    "So yeah, basically like that's what I do with like value, uhm, power like, make sure things are standing out.",
    "Um, like you know, contrasting with each other some more, especially like working with color.",
    "Think it's important.",
    "There are some people they just start out and they do the entire painting in black and white and then they go back.",
    "And do like overlay layers on top of a black and white painting, but I like working with color so it's just a way to keep me in check by using this.",
    "All right?",
    "Um, so now?",
    "So we have that I am going to.",
    "Do that clean up, but I said I was going to do.",
    "Control.",
    "Alright, so I am actually going to.",
    "Try to color pic from maybe or not.",
    "Get some of that darker tone in her hair.",
    "No, I did not pick a darker tone.",
    "Let's see.",
    "Like not picking up the colors.",
    "Sometimes it is sometimes not come on.",
    "Whatever, I will just do it manually.",
    "I'm pretty sure this is the brush that I used.",
    "You know, maybe these lines right here.",
    "I think once I add my darker shadows in here.",
    "And maybe paint on top of this little bit.",
    "I think they might look a little bit more cohesive than they do right now.",
    "So I'm basically what I was doing before.",
    "He is.",
    "Kind of blocked out.",
    "They're shapes.",
    "And then we went back in and we added a few.",
    "No little curls.",
    "But I'll do that.",
    "After I get everything kind of blocked in.",
    "We want to keep in mind like the direction of the hair and like the volume.",
    "From here.",
    "So I think I kind of talked about this when I was doing the painting on the left.",
    "But you want to think of it as like a shape.",
    "I got 3 dimensional form.",
    "So it's like right here on this side I can see like it's kind of.",
    "Doing this.",
    "Like this is a section, this is kind of a section.",
    "You know?",
    "So that would be like 3D modeling lines.",
    "Um, kind of like that.",
    "On top of it.",
    "So if you think about it more like that then you kind of.",
    "Uhm, you understand where to put the highlights.",
    "Moraine Lake were to block in your shadows.",
    "But right now I'm just kind of layering.",
    "Up some of the color I picked.",
    "Um, like a combination of this background color and the dark color that I picked.",
    "When I started working on the hair.",
    "So I'm going to have like.",
    "A base color, and then I'm going to go back in and like punching those darks.",
    "I might, I might even need to go back and erase some of these little lines in here.",
    "Oh, I forgot to turn my phone volume down.",
    "Yes.",
    "And since we're working on top of all the other layers, I don't have to worry about.",
    "Like you know, if I did something like that, just erase it.",
    "I also think it's important to try to utilize your your pin pressure and just kind of like lightly.",
    "Press sometimes and then you can go back in an.",
    "You know, take up a color in here since it's pretty much the combination of this one and this one.",
    "Uh, so you can just find new tones to add.",
    "That way.",
    "Plus a few out some of the background kind of show through.",
    "I think it looks nice.",
    "Like what you have underneath here.",
    "Thank you, I wish I had this outfit hanging.",
    "So cute.",
    "So the theme for the printing secret club for this.",
    "This illustration was called the Citrus Grove and I actually like.",
    "I've been planning on doing this drawing for like two or three months now.",
    "So.",
    "I like, I already made up the little like um, little card thing that I put on Instagram so it says like you know this one theme is whatever and it'll have like a little.",
    "Kind of like a preview.",
    "Of the illustration, which is not like you know, it's not like a little like cropped piece of the illustration, 'cause usually like I'll do the illustration during that month.",
    "And Mail it out the following month so this one is going to be this ones for June, so it's going to be mailed out in July.",
    "But I'll just post like.",
    "A little like square thing that's got like this one had like a tree an like an orange slice on the sticker had little question marks on it, so I had already made that up like months ago 'cause.",
    "Uhm, I need.",
    "This is kind of like what I wanted to do.",
    "That's I've got about her back.",
    "Um?",
    "So I can see the color a little bit better.",
    "So I'm looking Oh my gosh, I think I lost my pin pressure.",
    "OK.",
    "So the darkest darks are going to be.",
    "Down here like.",
    "They were going to erase some of this stuff first.",
    "Out here, um.",
    "Thank you I.",
    "I don't know like I feel like.",
    "Some people find it really hard to draw her, but once you kind of think about it a little bit more like you know the direction it's coming from.",
    "And like you're like, think about it in big shapes.",
    "Then it really.",
    "Kind of changes the way.",
    "That you approach it.",
    "So.",
    "I do have a tutorial on YouTube, like how.",
    "To draw hair.",
    "I think it's kind of old at this point, though I don't remember when I did that.",
    "Might have been this year.",
    "Maybe it was last year.",
    "I just don't know anymore.",
    "I have no concept of time like I didn't know what day it was when I woke up this morning.",
    "Oops.",
    "I like I worked yesterday, um, just working on like.",
    "Patris, on commissions and stuff.",
    "But like I don't know it's Sunday 'cause I'm working.",
    "I've been trying to get get a lot of stuff done recently, so then like.",
    "Working on the weekend so.",
    "Sometimes I'll stream on the weekend too.",
    "It's like just get some more stuff done.",
    "Call Just trying to like get the pen pressure back.",
    "It's like not working right now.",
    "Come on.",
    "It never does this for this long.",
    "Why it's doing it?",
    "Play I can't shade if I have my brush like messing up like this.",
    "That is.",
    "I don't know guys drive me crazy.",
    "OK.",
    "So.",
    "Gonna continue adding a little bit.",
    "Texture on the edges.",
    "And add some curls.",
    "And here before we go back and erase the lines.",
    "See.",
    "I feel like I need more coffee today.",
    "I shouldn't drink any though.",
    "I probably couldn't fall asleep later.",
    "Try not to drink too much coffee like I like coffee, but usually drink like 10 ounces.",
    "The day, like in the morning.",
    "But I know some people that go back for coffee like they just keep filling it up.",
    "They have big pot of coffee and they just keep drinking it.",
    "I don't think I could do that.",
    "I would not be able to fall asleep.",
    "I think.",
    "OK, so I think this is.",
    "A pretty good start.",
    "Here.",
    "We're going to go back and we're going to find these little scribbles.",
    "Not this one.",
    "OK, so we're going to come in and we're going to erase some of this using the same brush.",
    "So we don't have to take all of it out.",
    "So leave a little.",
    "It.",
    "I don't need to go back and add those Flowers in her hair too.",
    "I don't do it now.",
    "I will probably forget.",
    "OK, so I think that looks better already.",
    "Zoom out a little bit.",
    "So we added so it looks closer to.",
    "Are dumb.",
    "Original design on the left.",
    "I'm going to add a few.",
    "Big uhm shadow areas.",
    "I am coloring on the wrong layer.",
    "Don't know where that is.",
    "Oh the adding more lines look.",
    "I'm just going to come in here and lightly, just.",
    "Have like the darkest shadows.",
    "Doing this like.",
    "You know her hair is like pulled up, so you've got these kind of like lines going this way.",
    "Um, up to her ponytail and I am separating that and making it more obvious that that's what's happening by adding like a darker shadow like in here and then kind of coming back out this way to show the direction of the rest of your hair.",
    "I'm also thinking about shape.",
    "Of the overall.",
    "Peace.",
    "Uhm, and I think here in a little bit I'll just.",
    "I'll probably end up using.",
    "Liquefy to pull this part down a little bit and maybe like push it in to make the shape more similar to this one so I don't want to do that right now because.",
    "I just want to wait until.",
    "I can merge this together.",
    "All right?",
    "Hey we got a little bit of our cleanup done.",
    "OK.",
    "No, I'm not gonna do I think.",
    "Form of an.",
    "I'm going to add a little bitty fit.",
    "Highly right here.",
    "I like tablet.",
    "And here and on the top of her head.",
    "All right?",
    "So.",
    "Um?",
    "Her earrings are actually pretty much done.",
    "OK, perfect.",
    "I'm just going to pick up this color and then I'm going to.",
    "Actually, I'm going to pick up this color.",
    "I'm going to try to get it somewhere in between.",
    "That looks much better.",
    "Like matches.",
    "More.",
    "And selling a little bit of the red like peek through.",
    "But the most part.",
    "I needed that.",
    "Just help it look a little bit more cohesive.",
    "Yeah, that's a lot better.",
    "Um?",
    "Which tablet and pin are you using?",
    "So I'm using a centriq.",
    "24 Pro, I think that's what it's called.",
    "2024 pro I just got this like last month so.",
    "So like learning a lot of a lot of things about it, trying to get the colors to match from my computer.",
    "To the tablet has been a little bit of an issue, but.",
    "You know we are trying our best over here.",
    "And then the pin is just the pin that it comes with.",
    "I think it's the.",
    "2nd generation of pin.",
    "I don't really remember what it's called, it's just it's the one that it came with.",
    "All right?",
    "No.",
    "No.",
    "Trying to find the right shadow tone here.",
    "Just a matter of like picking colors from the canvas and seeing if hoping it just messed up my color that I found.",
    "Hang around to orange.",
    "Can you go more red?",
    "Maybe even just pick this color up.",
    "Yeah he goes good.",
    "That'll work.",
    "Basically I'm just coming in here and.",
    "Going on top of the.",
    "Um lines and the color that I already did.",
    "I'm making it more clear like what's going on here.",
    "And like honestly, this.",
    "Illustrations already like.",
    "Pretty clean I would say.",
    "Uhm compared to like some of mine.",
    "Like sometimes I will come.",
    "You know, go straight from sketch to color an.",
    "I won't really do like any of this cleaner line work.",
    "Um, which ends up, you know, it's Messier at the beginning.",
    "And.",
    "You like, will just clean up on top of it.",
    "And do you like basically the same thing I'm doing now and I would get, you know, very similar.",
    "Results.",
    "While my coloring alot background now what even happened here?",
    "OK.",
    "You know, like.",
    "If I added any kind of like shadows at all last time, but it doesn't really look like I did, which is odd, 'cause I normally do that.",
    "Like I usually add like a little purple tone in the shadows and then go back and come.",
    "Kind of play with the color a little bit that way.",
    "No, that's not it.",
    "OK, kinda like what I already have down here.",
    "But basically, you know I'm putting down these colors and I'm just picking back other colors that already have down here.",
    "Blending them together.",
    "Um?",
    "You know, if I don't exactly love this color, I can just lightly paint on top of it.",
    "So some of it shows through still, but.",
    "It turns it down a little bit.",
    "Then I can pick.",
    "Color based on the new one that I made.",
    "That might be a better shot of color.",
    "So you can't like that little bit more.",
    "Feel like there's just something off about this brush right now.",
    "It's like I used this one.",
    "Quite a bit and just feels a little odd to me like I'm not getting the.",
    "The same blending that I want.",
    "Maybe it's 'cause I'm trying to also avoid.",
    "Running outside or drawing over top of the lines.",
    "Even though I can erase them, I.",
    "I'm still doing that.",
    "Not on purpose, just out of habit.",
    "No.",
    "I don't think this.",
    "But I added right here was necessary.",
    "Just looks odd to me.",
    "I don't know why this is not blending like it normally does.",
    "Like this is the whole process right now.",
    "Sing a little funky.",
    "Yes.",
    "I think I normally have something like 40, so that doesn't make sense.",
    "Yeah, I'm just having trouble seeing on the tablet right now.",
    "Maybe I should close my window, said the lights or something.",
    "So I can look up on the computer and I can see that it's a little bit different.",
    "Play playlist smooth is like what it looks like on the tablet right now.",
    "Very strange, I don't know.",
    "Maybe just lowering the opacity alot will help.",
    "Maybe I'm zoomed in too much.",
    "I'm like trying to.",
    "Get all these little little bitty details and I don't need to.",
    "Make it more frustrating than it needs to be.",
    "Maybe like afraid edge with a textured brush.",
    "Um?",
    "My after I work on.",
    "Her legs.",
    "Call dad.",
    "Some shadows here.",
    "Jason cleanup Since this little afraid part would be sitting on top.",
    "Well, thank you, um.",
    "Lately I feel like.",
    "Alright, I feel just so uninspired to draw anything.",
    "Um?",
    "Terry device uhm.",
    "Well, I.",
    "I'm like starting to feel the same way lately.",
    "I'm just like just really tired.",
    "I'm just really tired all the time.",
    "I've been so busy.",
    "I think.",
    "Maybe you need to take a break.",
    "I think brakes are very beneficial as long as they're not like.",
    "Too long, like don't take like a month off.",
    "I know like some people.",
    "I say that helps, but I disagree.",
    "Every time I've taken a long break.",
    "I've I felt like I forgot how to draw and that was miserable.",
    "Just trying to get back into it.",
    "So I don't.",
    "I don't take really long breaks anymore.",
    "Um?",
    "I might take like a week and just try not to think about drawing and then try to come back to it.",
    "Um?",
    "Or you could try, you know doing like challenges that you find like online like I know you know there's the character design challenge.",
    "Or do they have like prompts and stuff?",
    "I think it's like a monthly thing.",
    "I personally have not done one of those, but I've done like draw this in your styles and I I love doing those.",
    "Those are always fun.",
    "So just maybe try doing something where it's like you don't have to really think of the concept as much like.",
    "Just think about.",
    "You'll be thinking more about the actual like.",
    "Drawing.",
    "Aspect of it, uhm?",
    "So I think the thing that makes me.",
    "Feel.",
    "Burnt out is like.",
    "Having to think about things a lot more, and if I just kind of like.",
    "Do something where I can turn my brain off and just do like a draws in your style and just enjoy the process.",
    "Thanks, that really helps me get back in June things.",
    "Hum.",
    "So.",
    "Yeah I I do have that.",
    "You might have seen it already, but I have like a video like how to improve your art.",
    "On YouTube.",
    "And I do talk about like you might be in.",
    "You know the art improvement cycle.",
    "Where?",
    "You you're unhappy with your art because you are better at observing.",
    "And critiquing your own art.",
    "Then Um, like your ability right now.",
    "And that's like when I get frustrated, so it's like whenever.",
    "I can look at my drawings and like I'm like, well, I know what's wrong with it, but I don't know how to fix that.",
    "Um?",
    "So the way to kind of get out of that is to do more studies and.",
    "You know, try different things, I think.",
    "But I explained everything about that, like in the video.",
    "So that might be more helpful than me.",
    "Just kind of rambling and trying to remember everything that I said.",
    "Because like on the other side of that.",
    "You know you have.",
    "You might have those days where you're like.",
    "Yes, everything is going so good like I drew this thing.",
    "I really like it.",
    "But really, like you'll probably look back on that and say, like, Oh yeah, I could do that better now.",
    "So there's always like that balance.",
    "It's going to go.",
    "Um, back and forth.",
    "Um?",
    "Uh, do you know any other specifics where you could find the monthly character design challenge?",
    "I think it's on Facebook.",
    "I know I follow them on Facebook, it's like.",
    "Um?",
    "Right, maybe on Instagram that gets called like C.",
    "Their character design.",
    "Channel Character do you OK all I think about it just character design challenge on.",
    "You might not Instagram or on Facebook.",
    "They have like a group.",
    "So it looks like this.",
    "It's like a whistle and like.",
    "2.",
    "Like a pen and pencil.",
    "So that's what it is on Instagram and it's the same on like you can find the link on that.",
    "But to that on YouTube.",
    "So, uhm.",
    "But I've always meant to do one thing.",
    "I've never I have not gotten to it.",
    "I just feel like I have too much so I have to do, um.",
    "Maybe I need to like?",
    "Right that into my schedule or something.",
    "That I do.",
    "Because I mean.",
    "To be honest, like lately I've been feeling.",
    "Like the same way, kinda like about my art.",
    "Like I.",
    "I like how this looks.",
    "I like how you know some of the stuff that I've been doing lately looks.",
    "But at the same time, it's like it's not.",
    "It's not really like how.",
    "I wanted to look like I want to.",
    "Get into more like I want to be drawing more stylish things like push it further and further and further.",
    "And I tend to.",
    "Maybe fall back on.",
    "Realism because of the way I was taught.",
    "Again, college and stuff about uhm?",
    "Um?",
    "Anatomy and everything, which I think anatomy is very important to learn about.",
    "At the same time, it's like.",
    "Character design I thought it's a whole different thing.",
    "'cause ear.",
    "You're taking.",
    "What you know, an pushing it to a point where it's like.",
    "You know?",
    "Where it's um?",
    "You're talking about like shape language and everything, rather than just like.",
    "Draw what you see.",
    "And I I've always found that really fascinating, and I've always appreciated.",
    "You know, really good character design.",
    "I'm trying to get her knees.",
    "Right, I know it's like.",
    "I kind of like lost it when I painted.",
    "On top of everything.",
    "But it's like.",
    "And kind of see.",
    "Be like.",
    "I don't know.",
    "It's been awhile since I've done figure drawing and I really need to do that too, like there's so many things that you need to like, learn and then you have to keep practicing them to like make sure.",
    "I guess.",
    "You stay consistent.",
    "With that I'm not like figure drawing is.",
    "Very important to spend time.",
    "On that helps you like loosen up.",
    "Everything but.",
    "Um, how do you get the brush to show?",
    "Do you mean this?",
    "Is that what you mean?",
    "The like cursor.",
    "Because it's probably.",
    "Um?",
    "Preference.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Right?",
    "I probably got it in here, right?",
    "Let's see tools.",
    "No.",
    "I would imagine it somewhere in this like.",
    "So.",
    "Brush Outline or something like that.",
    "Um cursor.",
    "No.",
    "I think it's This is under preferences and Cursor, Yeah?",
    "There it is founded.",
    "Normal rush tip is what I haven't said too, so the standard it looks like this I think, and then, um.",
    "Yeah, but yeah, I know if you if you have your cat books turned on.",
    "Um caps lock.",
    "Not the right cursor.",
    "That happened to me.",
    "Um Oh, I'm procreate.",
    "I think it's under the same kind of thing.",
    "I think it's definitely under some kind of preference, I don't remember.",
    "Plans changed it in so long.",
    "Right?",
    "Yeah.",
    "We got some legs now.",
    "We can go paint.",
    "Little fringe part of her shorts.",
    "Um?",
    "Which we are going to do with.",
    "The.",
    "10 Oh, maybe a fuzzy and so on.",
    "Bring it with the fuzzy pencil.",
    "And I'm just going to pick up this color.",
    "I'm just painting on, you know what I already?",
    "Then To give these shorts Aluma texture.",
    "I'm gonna make sure we don't have them all like.",
    "You know in line super perfect.",
    "Because.",
    "They are ripped.",
    "So they wouldn't be.",
    "Perfect.",
    "No thanks, this part was necessary.",
    "All right now I can go back on top of here.",
    "Clean up some of those lines with the same textured brush.",
    "Z.",
    "I don't know if I want to.",
    "Take that out earlier.",
    "Um?",
    "Oh, you're welcome.",
    "I'm glad I found it on here and I kind of remember where it is an appropriate to uhm.",
    "Hopefully you found it.",
    "Um?",
    "Yes, we will be working on a background, so don't worry, I will.",
    "Try to come.",
    "Explain that as I go, you know backgrounds aren't my.",
    "Focus really, uhm?",
    "And it's hard to explain how to do a background without this, like doing it.",
    "Like I'm more like I know.",
    "More broadly, painting like portraits and characters and stuff rather than backgrounds.",
    "I did do backgrounds for my thesis and college just because that was the whole point is like take something you don't normally draw.",
    "And try to learn how to draw it better.",
    "I know.",
    "That was a challenge I put on myself.",
    "They didn't make me do it, but that's what I picked.",
    "And as far as backgrounds, you want to make them.",
    "Less detail than your main subject.",
    "Um?",
    "But before we do get to the background, I am going to paint this little white girl quick trying to make it look decent.",
    "Probably added.",
    "Today so far.",
    "I'm going to group that and so we can.",
    "Take a peek and see if I like it.",
    "Hum.",
    "OK.",
    "Make another layer, just pick up.",
    "Talk rush again.",
    "How to block this in kind of quickly 'cause I don't really want to work on the bike.",
    "We want to have that same kind of painterly style as everything else.",
    "I don't want to like overly render it.",
    "But for this bike, I'm definitely going to add some.",
    "Highlights with I mean shadows with a multiply layer that will add here in a minute.",
    "Doing stuff like this doesn't hurt either.",
    "So here I'm just kind of like making my lines like a little bit more clear.",
    "And.",
    "So I need to pull up the picture.",
    "Be.",
    "Here is the bike that I'm looking at.",
    "Hum, I don't know what the back was like.",
    "I think I just made this up.",
    "Microsoft, the Little Reflector Thingy.",
    "So it needs a little bit of.",
    "Bread, but I don't want to make it too bright.",
    "That's OK, I don't mind this color.",
    "Maybe it is a little distracting, I don't know.",
    "Do you have to go to art school to work as an artist?",
    "I don't think you do.",
    "But Um?",
    "You definitely need.",
    "The skills to make a.",
    "Like to make good art that people will want.",
    "To either buy or wants you to make for them.",
    "Or to like build a strong portfolio so it's like.",
    "You know it doesn't really matter where you get those skills from, as long as you get the skills you know.",
    "So I mean, I did go to college for art, but I was not taught.",
    "Any digital art in college?",
    "Or I was not taught any digital art in a school setting at all.",
    "'cause it wasn't offered like where I live.",
    "So all of my.",
    "Learning as far as digital art goes was.",
    "Come on my own time.",
    "And just, you know, trying different things out or like if.",
    "I was, you know, working on something and.",
    "I was having trouble with it.",
    "I would just say like just go to Google and be like How do I do this?",
    "Um?",
    "So.",
    "Yeah, I don't know.",
    "I'm uh, actually have a video coming out.",
    "Um in August.",
    "About like that part of my art journey 'cause I just released a video on YouTube talking about like.",
    "Why I started doing art and um?",
    "My, uh, it's kind of like.",
    "My our journey and high school and um, like I talked about.",
    "Going to ringling for pre college?",
    "And that whole experience.",
    "But I I made two parts, so the second part is about like.",
    "My experience in college and then.",
    "Um my.",
    "Like how I started doing freelance.",
    "So.",
    "That's like coming out in August.",
    "But I actually have that on Patris on right now for those.",
    "Patrons.",
    "That support me in the YouTube here.",
    "Uhm, but it's just because I get their credits for that video and it wasn't supposed to be 2 parts and then it ended up being a lot longer of a video that I thought it was going to be.",
    "So I was like, well, we're going to split it up and.",
    "I want to put like a 30 minute video on YouTube.",
    "So, like in August, still have there.",
    "Credits for that video, but I'm taking like a break, this one from Patrion to focus on some other things.",
    "And Uhm.",
    "That's why it's like coming out in August instead of July.",
    "I like.",
    "And you talk about them.",
    "Pretty much what I just said about like do I think you need to go to art school 'cause I mean I did go to art school I mean it wasn't like art school or school like, you know, like Ringling or like Christy or something.",
    "Um?",
    "Because it was just like a local University that had an art program.",
    "But I'm still like, you know, I didn't learn from like a classroom like how to draw.",
    "Like this?",
    "I learn more traditional like how to do like proper anatomy and like how to.",
    "Paint on.",
    "A canvas with oil paints.",
    "Kind of thing.",
    "So it was like it was different, but I still like learned stuff that I could apply.",
    "To this.",
    "So.",
    "Yeah, um.",
    "Are drawing from mood boards considered plagiarism?",
    "I don't think so.",
    "Um, as long as like you don't want to draw like.",
    "Exactly the person that you see.",
    "Like if I.",
    "Let's see, I'll pull up.",
    "A mood more that I made.",
    "Because I did do like a mood board challenge thing.",
    "Uhm, I think you know if you hear something like moodboards underpinned.",
    "If I did so I did make a character out of this mood board, but it's like I just threw her in this outfit and I gave her some Flowers and a bag of like that's not.",
    "The thought of copying anything looks like you're making a character inspired by that.",
    "OK.",
    "I have a sticker that I meet her.",
    "Actually.",
    "See.",
    "Yeah, you can totally see it's like the same shirt.",
    "So she's got a bag in the Flowers.",
    "But like it can be inspired by that.",
    "I mean really.",
    "I don't know where I heard this, but it's like once an article of clothing is made then it's like.",
    "You can just make the same articles, clothing and it's like not plagiarizing it, uhm?",
    "But if it's if it's still a design, it's not made yet, then you can't plagiarize the design.",
    "In that stage.",
    "I don't know, it's weird, I don't know where I heard that from, or if it's even correct, so.",
    "Um?",
    "But I mean this isn't any kind of like crazy outfit, but.",
    "Would have to be thought about alot.",
    "It's like I wear stuff like that, um?",
    "But I mean even stuff like this.",
    "I think I did a mood board, kind of like this.",
    "And you know, I didn't draw this girl, but I think I drew her hair similarly.",
    "So.",
    "But I wouldn't be going in and like.",
    "If I say I.",
    "Made a mood board and I.",
    "Person that.",
    "Like they made a mood board and it was like this girl was on my mood board an I drew this exact same picture an I sold it like I don't think that would be OK.",
    "But you can be inspired by maybe her pose, just like laying down in some leaves.",
    "You don't have to draw her, uh, so just switch it up enough to wear it.",
    "Not the exact same thing.",
    "I would say.",
    "I get back to move forward that I was looking at.",
    "For my Pinterest Board hears like this is basically my mood board for this, it's like.",
    "Like I use this pose.",
    "For this.",
    "But like.",
    "Come back.",
    "But it's like I needed a pose reference.",
    "So that's what I found was like this works.",
    "This is the idea I had in my head, but I mean, you know I've got oranges and stuff and it's not like I'm drawing this.",
    "For this, it's like the whole like feeling of it.",
    "This like kind of painterly brush.",
    "And see how that goes going to do something like lines like this.",
    "Like very kind of like layered and choppy looking.",
    "I don't know.",
    "I feel like I'm kind of like in between.",
    "Files like.",
    "I am kind of looking at different directions to take my art style an adult.",
    "I don't know.",
    "I'm doing a lot of like experimenting with different brushes and stuff right now is like this fresh that I'm using right now is like the one that I always used to use for everything no matter what it was.",
    "And you know, I was trying to get away from that, but then sometimes I look at my old art and I'm like why do I like this better?",
    "Looks sad.",
    "So I'm like trying to figure out how I wanted.",
    "I want to like paint things in the future.",
    "I guess not everything has to be like the same all the time I can switch it up, but I don't know which ones.",
    "My favorite way to paint anymore.",
    "Same for awhile there.",
    "I was trying a lot of like really textured brushes.",
    "On characters.",
    "Like I did.",
    "One uhm.",
    "Actually another sticker.",
    "I think it's on my wall.",
    "I don't think you can see it, but it's like a fairy.",
    "It was one of my drawers in your style challenges on Instagram.",
    "But if you like, look closely at the lines on that one.",
    "It's a lot more textured than what I would normally use and.",
    "I like how it turned out, but it was difficult to.",
    "Try to capture that look 'cause I'm not used to drawing that way.",
    "Thing being more precise, like I like to be messy whenever I paint.",
    "So maybe that's just not for me, even though I like the way it looks when other people do it.",
    "Maybe that's just not.",
    "How my stylus supposed to be?",
    "'cause it should be something that comes naturally.",
    "Well, you enjoy doing and I didn't really enjoy doing that.",
    "You know, I like how it turned out.",
    "The.",
    "Very frustrating.",
    "Took longer than I thought it would.",
    "That's why I paint like this rather than.",
    "You know, going in and doing super clean lines.",
    "In the first place, 'cause I like painting over stuff.",
    "I like sculpting.",
    "The colors on the here.",
    "Coming back and admin those lines.",
    "Paint over the whole thing.",
    "Just change the color a little bit.",
    "That's what I like to do.",
    "How old do you have to be to make and sell art?",
    "Uhm, I don't know how old you have to be.",
    "Uhm, you might need to look that up like.",
    "On line somewhere.",
    "Um?",
    "I didn't start selling art.",
    "Until I was.",
    "What year was it like 2017 or 2018?",
    "I think so.",
    "I don't know how old I was like 20.",
    "Siri 24 maybe 24 I don't know.",
    "I turned 27 on Thursday so.",
    "I don't know.",
    "No.",
    "Hopefully it's working.",
    "You might have to be like you know, old enough to work to sell.",
    "Quite could improve the peace.",
    "But that would also be like for one of my patrion tears, probably the one the $10 here where people get their YouTube credits.",
    "Channel Come on dude.",
    "That's annoying, I can.",
    "I can make him leave.",
    "She's just pretty feisty.",
    "I don't think he'll stop anytime soon.",
    "Uhm, I, I mean, I thought that would be like an interesting YouTube video and it would also help people.",
    "Um, I've seen some other like artists on YouTube doing that.",
    "How do I know that's kind of cool?",
    "That's interesting to watch, because really, it's like you can apply.",
    "Other people's critiques to your own art sometimes.",
    "Whenever I I took some classes on school ISM.",
    "And they like they have a directed course where you have, like your instructor, who will critique your work and give you feedback and stuff.",
    "But like if you take the.",
    "Like I don't know what it's called, it's just like you get the videos and like the lessons you get, like the critiques from other people too.",
    "And that's like really helpful just to watch those.",
    "So then you kind of understand, like, oh, this is.",
    "This is what they're looking for.",
    "But yeah, I think that would be.",
    "Pretty cool to do, it wouldn't be this month, but.",
    "Mrs patreons like on pause right now.",
    "But I might do that.",
    "In July or no, no no.",
    "It's July now I won't do it in August because I already have a video for August, so we might do that in September.",
    "I don't know 'cause I have to figure out like.",
    "Yeah, well logistics of everything like.",
    "But what if I get too many people wanting one and?",
    "How do I like get them all done?",
    "I don't know.",
    "I don't remember how many people are in that tier.",
    "I think total look like.",
    "80 something people.",
    "Between the bacteria and then the other two that are above that, that would also get that benefit.",
    "So I have to figure out, like you know how.",
    "Do I get those all done?",
    "If everybody wants one like I know like everybody probably won't won't once because.",
    "You know?",
    "I don't know how everybody feels about having their work critiqued.",
    "So like in a video.",
    "And like outlook.",
    "Out in public, you know.",
    "Alright, wait.",
    "Critique differently, so I don't want to like, like of course I'm not like being mean or anything like it's always very respectful critique.",
    "Like even on discord and stuff.",
    "Just other people.",
    "In there were always very nice.",
    "Not even happened here.",
    "Hello.",
    "Welcome to our stream.",
    "Just working on cleaning some stuff up right now.",
    "I can share this bike.",
    "Looks like a bike.",
    "Uhm, I want to move on to the background soon.",
    "I'm just trying to get the rest of this done.",
    "Oh, thank you.",
    "Um?",
    "Which app are you using?",
    "So I'm using photo shop right now.",
    "Romans orange got a little weird.",
    "Do.",
    "I think I need to go back and erase some of these lines out of here.",
    "OK, what are you doing?",
    "She sniffing awful.",
    "I don't know what that means.",
    "So I don't think I ever told you guys is whenever Oakley like I don't know if you just heard him do it, but he sounds like.",
    "Because.",
    "He sounds like Tarzan.",
    "Like when he's trying to talk to Jane.",
    "I don't know why he does that, but it it always makes me laugh.",
    "I think it's funny, wants attention.",
    "He's very silly.",
    "Elk Lady I said on my lap.",
    "Hope you don't need my bag please.",
    "He's trying to eat the the paper on my trashcan earlier.",
    "Finding He's a mess.",
    "Marley's being good, he's laying on his blanket.",
    "I know please.",
    "Trying to eat my purse on the floor.",
    "Sir, very different dogs.",
    "Oh, honey.",
    "Um is digital art better than just doing traditional?",
    "I wouldn't say it's better.",
    "Uhm, I just prefer digital to traditional.",
    "Because I am.",
    "I like having the ability to undo and, um.",
    "Apple.",
    "Siri up there.",
    "I didn't mean to do that.",
    "Just having like the ability, I don't know.",
    "It's like I feel like there's more flexibility with.",
    "Digital art than there is with traditional.",
    "And also I'm very impatient and take a long time.",
    "Well, I mean this takes a long time to but like.",
    "I don't know.",
    "And is preferred this it just depends on what you prefer.",
    "I mean, digital art is a good skill.",
    "To know like if you're going into like animation industry and like.",
    "Trying to get a job.",
    "And there good to know how to use photo shop because it's like the industry.",
    "Standard, but uhm.",
    "Yeah, uh.",
    "They don't really do a lot of like traditional stuff.",
    "Um, because it takes longer.",
    "So I'd say like it's a good skill to learn, but that doesn't mean it's better.",
    "You know, I.",
    "Like I started out doing traditional like pretty much everybody starts out during traditional art.",
    "'cause it's more accessible.",
    "Thank you stick'em pencil.",
    "There you go.",
    "I don't know why this bike is so hard to draw.",
    "I think it's hard to paint.",
    "Probably 'cause I want to move on to the background and it's not letting me.",
    "It's the only thing standing in the way.",
    "I feel like I have a piece of her in my life.",
    "Just for my pin.",
    "Um?",
    "Don't look at me.",
    "Oh no, I have something in my hold on I'll be right back.",
    "Um?",
    "I had a big old piece of frozen my so that was not fun um.",
    "We got some questions.",
    "I see.",
    "Hum.",
    "How do you blend on digital art and how do you color a background?",
    "Well, we're going to work on coloring a background in 2nd.",
    "Once I finish his bike.",
    "And then I'll talk about that.",
    "But with blending, I would say to.",
    "Try to lower your opacity.",
    "Of your brush.",
    "And really try to utilize your pen pressure.",
    "Because, you know?",
    "Like Most tablets they have.",
    "Pin pressure where?",
    "So you see, like this is me pressing like as lightly as I can, and you can barely see it, and this is the opacity turned all the way up and then it's like I can do this.",
    "I can press harder and then it's.",
    "Like that, so I mean, it's just being like really gentle with it.",
    "And you can also so my flow of my brush up here is that 80.",
    "If I lower it.",
    "It's like less.",
    "Comes out onto the canvas.",
    "Um?",
    "Um, so I just like I usually just press really lightly.",
    "And I I keep, you know, picking up the color.",
    "But I want to use.",
    "Putting it down.",
    "Boy, I really lost all this.",
    "The structure of the bike here whenever I.",
    "Hum.",
    "Start working with these lines.",
    "I need to pick a color.",
    "Try to create a little bit more structure here, uhm?",
    "How smart are my glasses?",
    "Um?",
    "This is my first time joining the chat on the cancel welcome.",
    "Um, do you like procreate or photo shop better?",
    "Um, I like them both.",
    "I've been using photo shop a lot longer an I prefer using photo shop when I am.",
    "Making big pieces like this.",
    "But you know?",
    "Procreate is so good for.",
    "I mean, you can use it for a lot of things, but.",
    "I like it for sketching, mostly since.",
    "It's on my iPad.",
    "But yeah.",
    "I use both so.",
    "Right now I'm using photo shop.",
    "Of what digital art pad do you recommend XP pen or who Jan?",
    "So I've used both of those.",
    "My who Jan one actually did a giveaway for it and it was very similar to the Wakeham intuos pro that I have.",
    "Um, which was a tablet that I mainly used like before this one.",
    "Um?",
    "So.",
    "That one was good and then the one the other one that I got was a dumb.",
    "XP pen artist.",
    "Wells pro I think it was called.",
    "I did a review on both of them.",
    "They were both on my YouTube.",
    "But I don't really know like which one.",
    "I would prefer out of the two brands necessarily because they were very different tablets like that one did not have a screen and the other one did.",
    "So I think.",
    "It's kind of A.",
    "Different in that way, so I can't really say like which one I like better.",
    "Uhm, I will say that what the XP pen I did get a little frustrated with the.",
    "What was that like connection issues?",
    "It was the display one.",
    "But it wouldn't like keep my settings that reflect the settings would reset every time my chapter my computer would turn off.",
    "Close, frustrating.",
    "I don't know if it was something on my end or not and it didn't.",
    "That wasn't happening when I did the review.",
    "It happened later on.",
    "So.",
    "I don't know.",
    "I don't like this like, uhm.",
    "Oh, what am I using as?",
    "As far as I'm using a graphics tablet so it's.",
    "Um, so why come Centriq 24 pro?",
    "Um?",
    "What do you recommend posting?",
    "Uh.",
    "What do you recommend posting a draws in your style?",
    "Uh, do you mean like when you're making and you draw this in your style for other people to draw or your.",
    "Like Are you asking if there's a suggestion of a draw this in your style that you should try to do.",
    "Um?",
    "I'm so confused as to what's happening on this bike.",
    "I don't want to draw this by right now.",
    "Why did I do this to myself?",
    "Um?",
    "Can you do a tutorial on a side profile?",
    "I will do that eventually.",
    "I still need to do my leg.",
    "How to draw a face?",
    "Tutorial like I have like how to draw knows how to draw a mouth.",
    "Had it all eyes.",
    "How to paint here like I have that kind of stuff on my YouTube channel?",
    "But I don't have the full face tutorial, but after I do that one, I'll probably do the profile view which that like profile view is actually something I do struggle with from time to time.",
    "So, uhm, I want to also.",
    "Make sure I know how to teach that before.",
    "I teach it, you know, like I want to be like.",
    "Um?",
    "Like I want to be an expert before I be a teacher, you know.",
    "So.",
    "I don't want to like teach you guys wrong.",
    "Um?",
    "What video do you think I should do?",
    "Coloring skin tones are coloring on toned tanned paper.",
    "Uh, it depends on what you're using.",
    "Are you using?",
    "That kind of paper.",
    "Uh, because it's like when you're using that kind of paper is basically like you're starting with.",
    "Like Gray or.",
    "Like Tan and then you're dumb.",
    "Like building up colors on top of that.",
    "So I would say.",
    "To start with the.",
    "Maybe the other video?",
    "Don't know what I'm doing.",
    "Hello.",
    "Say like I would not make a tutorial on how to draw bikes because I don't know how this is working.",
    "How does a bike fit together, don't know.",
    "No problem.",
    "Um?",
    "OK.",
    "I'm trying to wrap this bike up very soon so we can look at this background finally.",
    "Don't want to spike anymore.",
    "Huh?",
    "Or maybe we should move on from the bike to do the background and then come back to the bike?",
    "Um, what kind of brushes do I use to do the base for the background?",
    "We have this that we cleaned up.",
    "And now we're going to go into the background.",
    "I'm going to go all the way.",
    "Down here.",
    "Pointless line here, alright so.",
    "I'm just going to put my background.",
    "Here in a group and.",
    "The rest of the character in a group I know she's already in a group, cool.",
    "Um, I'm going to make a new layer in between.",
    "The background and the character.",
    "That's going to be the clean up for the background.",
    "And So what I'm going to start out with is.",
    "I'm gonna.",
    "So I have all this kind of like blocked out.",
    "I guess I can show you guys like.",
    "So this is like what I drew.",
    "This is my sketch and then I like.",
    "Set it to multiply an I layered it.",
    "Like layered colors on top of each other with the multiply on top of that.",
    "Um, so now I'm just going to paint over the whole thing.",
    "We're going to start in the foreground with a.",
    "Textured brush I think I'm going to do, um.",
    "This.",
    "Sharp render maybe?",
    "Trying to get something that would be like nice, untextured for like dirt.",
    "Um will be flat painting.",
    "I think we're going to go with this one.",
    "It's a flat painting brush, uhm?",
    "And I'm going to pick up this color that already laid down, and we're going to make it a little bit.",
    "More red.",
    "We want to add some depth in here.",
    "Make sure we have our.",
    "Pen pressure turned on.",
    "I'm just going to.",
    "Gently brush in.",
    "This.",
    "It's OK if I go on top of the graph.",
    "Because we'll end up putting the grass on top of this dirt, so I'm just kind of like layering this in right now.",
    "Um?",
    "Trying to get rid of these lines that we had.",
    "Go back and pick up some of this color.",
    "Um?",
    "This will just be like a base for our.",
    "Color here, it will just do most of the shadows.",
    "Um?",
    "Kind of like this.",
    "I'm going to do them better than that.",
    "I'm going to probably redo that altogether.",
    "Um?",
    "But for this like party here I started out with a bigger brush and now I'm kind of like.",
    "And I'm like change depression made a little bit smaller.",
    "Trip tips like get some textures in here.",
    "And then I'm going to.",
    "Yeah, some like little highlight areas.",
    "Oh that's too much.",
    "What happened here?",
    "Let's start a new kind of look like a dirt Rd.",
    "I think it would be nice if we threw some kind of grainy.",
    "Texture on top of this.",
    "Um?",
    "How do I found or how do you find shadow color?",
    "Or how do you color or find shadows?",
    "Uhm, well, I think mostly like picking color or something that.",
    "Um?",
    "Kind of comes overtime.",
    "I I had to watch a ton of videos on like.",
    "Color theory, I think that's a good place to start is like watching stuff about color theory.",
    "It's very complex and it has everything to do with.",
    "He like.",
    "So this axis right here.",
    "I like your value like light and dark.",
    "This one is saturation.",
    "And then this is Hugh, so this right here is up in the top corner.",
    "That's like the purest form of this.",
    "Q.",
    "Along this side, so it's like I pull it this way, it's making it.",
    "More desaturated an in this ones like making it darker in value since the war saturated but darker in value.",
    "So it's like learning about that and like you don't want to like have colors like this.",
    "Um?",
    "Like generally speaking, if you want your paintings to be more cohesive.",
    "But I mean something you have to like.",
    "Work on a lot an practice.",
    "So and then as far as shadow colors.",
    "That has to do more with like lighting and, um.",
    "It's like.",
    "I don't know.",
    "Um?",
    "Sorry, I'm trying to do this and talking same time.",
    "So like your lighting and stuff, so it's like.",
    "Warmer shadows will have army warmer light will have cooler shadows, so generally speaking I have like blueish purple shadows in like typical lighting situations.",
    "Like if they light and stuff.",
    "But I learned stuff about lighting and shadow from a book called.",
    "Um color an light.",
    "By James Gurney.",
    "Oh, you know what I did all this was on the wrong layer or no, it's not.",
    "You know what I did I have this adjustment layer turned on.",
    "So whenever I pick up colors for cancer on one cool so I have to paint without my adjustment, I'll have to come back and turn it back on.",
    "But yeah, color and light by James Gurney is the book that I recommend if you're trying to learn about lighting.",
    "Well, and color I guess.",
    "It is a fantastic book.",
    "Um?",
    "It talks about like the shadow colors and stuff and like divided up into sections and as a bunch of different lighting situations.",
    "Very helpful.",
    "I know you can like find it online so.",
    "Um and like there's little things that you'll need to learn about, like, um.",
    "It's it's like.",
    "Um?",
    "Look what happened to her forehead.",
    "Something happened.",
    "I don't know it's because I have this turned off.",
    "She had like spots on her forehead, then it's like words that line come from.",
    "Um?",
    "So.",
    "As I talk about atmospheric perspective.",
    "Like important to learn about.",
    "So basically I mean will actually do this later but.",
    "It's like stuff back here.",
    "You get more of the Sky color.",
    "Um mixed in.",
    "So.",
    "Right now I'm just kind of like.",
    "Blocking in like Maine.",
    "Parts of the background and I'm going to.",
    "Take another brush and.",
    "Add some texture and some light color variation in here.",
    "Yes, I got this like basic green down here.",
    "And I'm going to take a.",
    "Darker green with a.",
    "Cooler shadow tone.",
    "Just slightly.",
    "Hum.",
    "And I'm going to run for this.",
    "Maybe not I don't know.",
    "I don't know what version is, maybe this one.",
    "This graph is pretty far away.",
    "It's like it doesn't really matter if it's detail or not, like I don't have to go through and.",
    "Do this you know.",
    "Closer up stuff I might do a little bit of that like right here.",
    "But I'm going to get a general.",
    "Kind of like.",
    "Texture laid down like that.",
    "At least, that's how I can do it.",
    "I always go back and I pick up the original color that I had down here.",
    "2.",
    "Hum.",
    "But I mean at this stage is always like this part always looks a little rough, but like once you add the lighting and stuff on top of it.",
    "I think it looks a lot better.",
    "Um, how do you know you're good at art?",
    "Well, I think an important skill to learn is how to look at your art critic, Lee Ann.",
    "I know like usually early on, that's not a skill that, uhm?",
    "We all have to play cure ability observe.",
    "And I mean really like, good art is subjective, but it's like.",
    "If you're planning on.",
    "Selling your work or doing art for other people.",
    "There's a certain like.",
    "I don't know, um.",
    "It's like people are looking for a certain quality so.",
    "Um, by you having the ability to.",
    "Like looking at.",
    "Wait, you guys soon.",
    "Right now or something, um.",
    "Are you having the ability to look at your own work and say OK?",
    "Is this on that level like that's so important to be able to do?",
    "So I think I don't really understand like how to learn that other than like experience.",
    "Hello.",
    "You know, it's something that's.",
    "I think it comes over time with.",
    "More drawing experience.",
    "Don't know, hopefully after party I think.",
    "I hope Chris let him outside.",
    "His Jingle in the door.",
    "So we probably trained him like has a little Jingle Bells on the door.",
    "OK, so we're just getting some texture in here.",
    "Right now trying to.",
    "Get something going.",
    "I like I did this the wrong direction.",
    "I don't know what I'm doing.",
    "Send something working this way the whole time.",
    "Yeah, I like the grass right here.",
    "It's not our focus, so we don't want to like.",
    "Overly detail, everything will just wanted to be kind of.",
    "Kind of subtle.",
    "Have like the values in there, but.",
    "I'll probably end up blurring the whole background anyways.",
    "So it's like why spend your time doing something.",
    "It's just going to be covered up, you know.",
    "What's my favorite fresh for coloring?",
    "Actually switch it up a whole lot.",
    "Like that talk brush that I was using uhm?",
    "Like I you see, is that like all the time and then like I found the gene sketch brushes.",
    "So I use those a lot like.",
    "Every brush that I've used in this video has been one of those except for the top brush.",
    "But I was using like sometimes.",
    "But I think, uhm?",
    "I don't know if it's in the replay of the life stream or if it like shows up right now, but there's something called the tool timeline where it'll tell you like which brush I'm using and stuff.",
    "Like when I'm using it.",
    "Thanks, pretty cool.",
    "So I think this is a good start.",
    "Last night saying pressure.",
    "Oh, you should just go for it.",
    "Just post it.",
    "Doesn't matter if people don't like it or not.",
    "I'm posting my art.",
    "I was like 14.",
    "And I posted on deviant art, and I mean, you know, I've got my fair share if.",
    "Mean comments over the years, but.",
    "You can like take that and you could be.",
    "You know?",
    "Sad about the comments.",
    "Or you could be like OK, well I'm going to look into fixing something like not all comments of course are like.",
    "Not all that makes sense.",
    "People sometimes are just mean to be mean, but I gotta comment on one of my drawings like a couple years ago.",
    "That said, like Haha look at her nose like just making fun of it an.",
    "I was like what's wrong with the nose and then I started looking at it more.",
    "I was like maybe I should look into the knows more than try to learn how to draw knows better.",
    "That's what I did and now everybody says I like the way you draw noses.",
    "I like it better to better than I used to do.",
    "Um?",
    "But I mean critique in general is a good thing like.",
    "That's how you grow.",
    "No.",
    "So yeah, I definitely think you should go for it.",
    "Please post it.",
    "It'll be OK.",
    "Using this pressure switch it.",
    "Oh, how long was your question?",
    "Um?",
