    "All right guys welcome back today, I'm going to be doing some texturing this time, using substance painter.",
    "Cut my model here, so we just threw together.",
    "It's a little cart for the community evil, setting what kind of village so.",
    "And we're just going to use sort rarely have in painter here.",
    "Maybe I'll happen to designer if their stuff I need but.",
    "Let's get started so.",
    "First things 1st is I have this set as 2 different texture sets.",
    "I've got one for the cart and one for the wheels and also the handles in a little bit more.",
    "Yeah, F3 here, I can pull up my UV's.",
    "This is the current I have it split up a lot more than I would usually.",
    "Usually I wouldn't work with so many seams but.",
    "We try something different this time.",
    "Specifically, I have 'em all separated based by.",
    "What type of material would be inward natural seems to be anyway so?",
    "If you look up here.",
    "All these panels are these pounds right here.",
    "And since these panels would most likely be separate material like in the real world to these right here.",
    "There be like a Seven piece of wood so I'm thinking like planks going horizontally and then.",
    "All right here.",
    "You know little beams going up and down and support.",
    "So I kept them separated there first thing like to do any any model is too big color Maps.",
    "You working with 2K.",
    "So 2048.",
    "It's it's non destructive so you can only change it later.",
    "Change your output and ourselves.",
    "You're working sites, with that.",
    "I don't have a high Poly mesh for this one.",
    "So I'm just going to say bagel texture sets.",
    "Just going to go through it's going to give me or ambient occlusion and whole bunch of other.",
    "Maps like the curvature in position that'll be good for.",
    "Using generators and things like that.",
    "Already.",
    "See it when I had to meet all their Maps if I had a high Poly it would.",
    "Big that detail into the normal but I don't for this, who it won't pop.",
    "The wheels back on and you can see.",
    "Now you just the tiniest bit of shading here was from the ambient occlusion.",
    "My friend I really just helps make it pop so.",
    "We're just going to start I think we started the actual card, so I can hide my wheels right here in my texture set.",
    "Now, almost exclusively work in failures.",
    "So you're going to pull up a wood material.",
    "But if you have wants to choose from.",
    "Honey over these planks, I got 2.",
    "I can't remember which is which.",
    "We're medizin designer.",
    "While ago.",
    "A number of Black Mesa little height at all.",
    "I think I will start with the inside here.",
    "If I select this little checkerboard pattern that will do it by.",
    "I can.",
    "Mask by shell so pressing actually can see switches between black and white.",
    "Its weight that pass through the Black Mask obviously so.",
    "Fylkir.",
    "My my you VS.",
    "Whenever I use the shell, it just does this entire bit.",
    "There's also I think is object so this would do everything.",
    "That's one object, then you can also do it like by face.",
    "Like that.",
    "And.",
    "I'm just gonna do this, or that.",
    "You know, and this one OK.",
    "So I'm going to have separate layers for this and this one.",
    "I guess these 2 in this one 'cause this one is laid out.",
    "Yeah, so these 2 are laid out horizontally in this ones vertically.",
    "Sort of rotate I'll show you what I mean, Skype that.",
    "Go into the material here and rotate it 90 degrees.",
    "I mean, we're going to throw the scale.",
    "There we go, we get some tiling here.",
    "Looks pretty good.",
    "You don't quite line up here so I'm going to.",
    "Through each one of these separate.",
    "Find.",
    "Under scaling we like first.",
    "I know if I if I press CI can switch through the different Maps.",
    "So the base color.",
    "And am to go back to material see everything in mind.",
    "Show.",
    "Think 10s pretty good scale.",
    "I was going to say this.",
    "Do any fill air.",
    "Actually, I'm going to.",
    "Just copy this failure.",
    "Likeness.",
    "Hide.",
    "OK.",
    "Here, I can just.",
    "Surrounded the offset try to get lined up.",
    "Now I can also uses a trip planner.",
    "It will give me here we go.",
    "We see make it easier to see.",
    "No pun intended.",
    "No one's here in here.",
    "Actually.",
    "This change my scaling little bit, yeah.",
    "Maybe.",
    "It's not perfect, as I need to be there.",
    "And we can do that one more time for this side over here.",
    "Shut this time, we're going to be rotating it.",
    "There we go.",
    "No this isn't.",
    "That's good enough for now.",
    "Go ahead and throw all these in a folder.",
    "Sorry about the name later.",
    "Hum.",
    "All this bump here this normal's a little bit intense mean to dial it back, I can go up here.",
    "And switch it to normal and then.",
    "Just going to do it now.",
    "Doing the right one wanna do this.",
    "We need to add A.",
    "You filled it only effects that can be hype what I'm looking at here.",
    "So if you are.",
    "See height.",
    "Actually can check here.",
    "Yeah, OK.",
    "Sing multiply.",
    "Yeah, there, we go, we still multiplying that all.",
    "She's at the flat knees out just a little bit.",
    "Too extreme my default.",
    "It's alright.",
    "What is hot today?",
    "Very warm.",
    "Alright let's do this one now.",
    "Not to worry about.",
    "By the color, I think it's an alright color.",
    "He would tell us the loan on the outside little more well let.",
    "That's the new here same thing.",
    "Do.",
    "For their mass kissed him down here.",
    "We are updated.",
    "90.",
    "At that scaling here.",
    "Submit Lurg.",
    "Like 8.",
    "My bed.",
    "I am seeing like a lot of detailed tile here worry about that when we get to like.",
    "Add dirt and grime and stuff.",
    "Once again.",
    "I'm just going to come down these sites.",
    "Little too extreme.",
    "I could go in and put a parameter for that.",
    "In the material itself, which is not a bad idea.",
    "But for now since I have this way.",
    "It's not too hard just touch effect height normal.",
    "Once we get to multiply there, we go.",
    "It would be better to have a slider in the material but.",
    "This gets the job done.",
    "Now I'm thinking.",
    "I don't want this all to be the same shade something this raining here.",
    "Maybe a darker wood or maybe even.",
    "Make a metal or something totally different.",
    "I'm thinking these little bits are going to be like iron rebar.",
    "Maybe we have more raw wood for this insider.",
    "But biscuits start naming here nor is going to confuse fast, so this is just going to be the.",
    "Kurt lips.",
    "For bed.",
    "It's gonna be.",
    "Hi addressed there, we go.",
    "Camp thinking.",
    "So that's alright.",
    "Smiths with these rails you're kinda.",
    "Kinda look we can get out of those.",
    "And that Black Mask was gonna throw on a color right here just for.",
    "So I can ask it out.",
    "There we go.",
    "6 Santa sleigh now now we're going for so I'm going to throw down.",
    "Don't know.",
    "Don't know.",
    "Do a lot of materials, we can work with here.",
    "So it can turn Iran.",
    "Rough.",
    "Something a lot darker than that.",
    "I think I think I might stick with would be honest is supposed to be like.",
    "The peasants card anyways, it seems like unlikely to have.",
    "A lot of medals or anything like that, so let's go back.",
    "CR Woods, OK, so this plank material, I made?",
    "The size down here.",
    "I know it's not well name, but this is supposed to affect the gap in the planks.",
    "So I have, I have 2 in here.",
    "I need to delete one.",
    "One has it 1 doesn't have it working?",
    "I think it's the other one.",
    "Yeah, here, we go there, we go and now it's got no.",
    "So these lines right here.",
    "But separate planks now that's all gone need to mess with the scale here.",
    "I think maybe it darker wood.",
    "I don't think I gave it any color control, so.",
    "The few things we can do here just like the height, adjust we can do the same thing, but with color.",
    "So if I throw on like just a black color, I can tell it to multiply.",
    "No.",
    "Ask through now.",
    "The scroll through see.",
    "Now you know multiply my pH.",
    "I just need to tell yeah here we go OK.",
    "And then I just needed throw on.",
    "I can copy this mask detail here.",
    "Copy mask and then paste it too.",
    "Yeah.",
    "And now this is ask acting as just just multiplying that black color.",
    "Now by the wood so just overall darkens it in a few different ways.",
    "You can go about doing it with just my way.",
    "and I like how it works.",
    "So we don't have a ton of texture resolution.",
    "On these railings.",
    "We look here, I think.",
    "Yeah, it's this over here, maybe.",
    "Used to.",
    "It's not me.",
    "It's not nothing but that's the entire thing rap so.",
    "Link one faces like.",
    "He.",
    "Not very large.",
    "Yeah, so this is the Top face here.",
    "And this is the bottom.",
    "Some can mess around.",
    "It was too much.",
    "Eat till I get that early should add A.",
    "Maybe we can do that for a time, but I can go back and look at the material in designer and maybe have a modifier for these not straight here.",
    "Or, a little parameter that I can change that we can just turn them off 'cause right now, I think they're just.",
    "A little too extreme.",
    "If you just bring this, yeah, OK.",
    "Since I didn ask out this high to test is just affecting all layers below it right now.",
    "I really should add make a note of that, but I should add.",
    "I had adjustment true for the material that we can just do it straight shooting.",
    "The thing without having any extra layers, not hard to do.",
    "Just.",
    "Look at this from as many angles that can.",
    "Get a fence so I think.",
    "Once again this is going a different direction.",
    "And if you think about it logically it would it really make sense for them to cut the wood in this direction like something if you chop down a tree and you need.",
    "A long piece, she would cut it, I guess vertically as opposed to horizontally so.",
    "I'm just going to mask this out, not that one.",
    "Now this one yes.",
    "And we'll just cut paste that.",
    "And this time it's clear that mask.",
    "And again here and rotated 90.",
    "And there, we go.",
    "The highest resolution, but Gets the job done.",
    "And, of course for final renders you can only just change it just like this.",
    "They can pump up to 4.",
    "Kane just because of how it's all all set up and how substance painter works.",
    "It preserves all that detail.",
    "You don't know it's not stretching anything.",
    "So that just means everything is just gonna be that much more crisp and see.",
    "I don't usually work in 4K.",
    "Cause your computer to chug issue depending on your specs and all that.",
    "But I will do my renders sometimes.",
    "In 4K and Quick good I'm just going to go ahead and name.",
    "Use.",
    "These layers before I forget what they do.",
    "This is my real April Durkin.",
    "This will just be.",
    "Real.",
    "Sites seeds and Rail.",
    "Black.",
    "Again, we can throw these all into a folder or proper.",
    "And just color rails and I'm thinking about it, I'm going to go ahead throw down to save.",
    "Try to keep everything organized but.",
    "So many folders.",
    "I gotta get like proper naming scheme going.",
    "Substance painter.",
    "There we go.",
    "In toilet cart.",
    "Turn off.",
    "Boot enough alright.",
    "I don't want to put the word on this side, but maybe.",
    "You know what you're going to do that on the same thinking.",
    "We follow the same scheme here with these panels right here.",
    "It'll be like the lighter color would that I have over here and then these beams.",
    "Maybe the darker one.",
    "I think that'll give it a nice contrast.",
    "Let's just go ahead and see.",
    "Norman testing it out.",
    "Second, one, I don't know maybe who knows their down 90.",
    "Yeah.",
    "I should put so this is a little let me explain one go into here.",
    "I should have paid more attention when laying on my UV's you can see here.",
    "These 2 panels are laid out upside down.",
    "Um.",
    "I could.",
    "Could do quick fix.",
    "And see how the mall lined up nicely here.",
    "Except.",
    "Which two is it anyways and just?",
    "It's just.",
    "Throughout a mask.",
    "In case these 2 middle ones.",
    "You still",
    "OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, yeah, this was too.",
    "I see now and while I'm thinking about it.",
    "Let's see if any, others are like that.",
    "Yes, OK.",
    "Yes yes yes.",
    "And.",
    "I think this whole site is upside down.",
    "But.",
    "It's OK.",
    "Set for this one.",
    "Right.",
    "If Me 2 seconds.",
    "I'm going to hop over in my modeling program.",
    "And just rotate the issue vise and I should just be able to bring it.",
    "Right back in and.",
    "Plug and play no problems.",
    "Which I'll be right back?",
    "OK, we should be good to go so I'm just going to pop up here and say.",
    "Oh, it's project configuration risking change the file expert to hear.",
    "Ulting goes point plan then.",
    "Nothing will break yeah, there, we go.",
    "Nothing broke.",
    "Now let's see if anything fixed.",
    "Early fixed.",
    "Oh, it is beautiful look at that easy fix do second fixed too.",
    "Awesome OK.",
    "I know how to do that I could have gone in and on the thing with separate layers, but you know.",
    "Extra work and all.",
    "It's just a little neater little cleaner.",
    "Little less of a hassle.",
    "Well, so I can do that might as well.",
    "Cool.",
    "Cool, cool cool.",
    "Poopoo Doo Doo.",
    "Beautiful.",
    "There we go.",
    "This mask is all sorts of funny just going to clear it.",
    "And I'm just going to grab it all.",
    "From the UV's here.",
    "Much easier.",
    "And look at this now, my planks lineup.",
    "Perfectly just great.",
    "Fantastic.",
    "Now you only can do is these I used the wrong one again.",
    "First, one.",
    "Yeah, OK.",
    "We can increase the gap that I thought it was a little weak.",
    "We got something like that there we go.",
    "How much better?",
    "I like it.",
    "Looking good.",
    "Very nice indeed.",
    "One thing I would say about this material that I need to fix or like.",
    "It's a bit of an issue is.",
    "You can see here that this like stain continues on over here.",
    "So the planks don't really feel.",
    "Like different blanks, they feel like they're all connected.",
    "It's an easy fix.",
    "If you just I think it's like vertex normal you can grab the each.",
    "Each plank and then just shifted so it's not a.",
    "They don't line up both help break it up.",
    "But that's something you want if you.",
    "You had no planks like that.",
    "But it's honestly.",
    "It's not that noticeable.",
    "I think they lined up all the way around.",
    "I think it's a pretty good size there.",
    "Very nice and this will be.",
    "Boo.",
    "Hello caps lock panels.",
    "There we go.",
    "Very nice.",
    "This last trip that we're all good all good.",
    "Maybe maybe on the outside here.",
    "Maybe just maybe it isn't plant.",
    "See how it looks.",
    "So if I missed with the scale.",
    "So I mean, you can kind of see these plants are hard to see anyways.",
    "But if I go in here.",
    "Give you that line completely.",
    "That's alright I think.",
    "Well, OK.",
    "I think I want these pieces vertical let's try that but I don't know.",
    "Looks Alright.",
    "I want to go ahead and had the wheels.",
    "Looks good looks good.",
    "We're just gonna do that old dark and again.",
    "It doesn't matter what color it doesn't matter what color but?",
    "I'll show you what I mean?",
    "Once again multiply.",
    "So add another black mask and.",
    "They're right there looks good so maybe I want to trade.",
    "Not my friend with the colour maybe on Celine.",
    "Yeah, let's take over mature almost like mahogany if I just had a little bit of red.",
    "Might be too.",
    "2 fancy firm donate for here so.",
    "Spell it up maybe.",
    "You know, maybe it's like.",
    "But of a paler would.",
    "So take a look at the second divide if I want to lighten it instead.",
    "I think darker I think darker looks better.",
    "I don't want to be the one to be the same as the railing.",
    "But after I want to be the same as the planks.",
    "Also I don't want to look too busy so.",
    "Gotta find that happy ground.",
    "Alright looks good looks good.",
    "Right.",
    "It's coded populous on the other side, too.",
    "And dark in.",
    "This holding shift right click move around my environment here, so I can.",
    "Check different angles of the lighting.",
    "Describe drink here.",
    "All right.",
    "Alright let's try let's do some of this.",
    "These are posts.",
    "I'm thinking, maybe here's their like iron reinforcement.",
    "Maybe like a rod iron to see what materials I have.",
    "Whoever right I don't think I've made 1.",
    "Now I do, do not.",
    "And if I did I probably would have spell it anyways.",
    "Browse always a good bet.",
    "Not only remember more bump.",
    "You know what?",
    "Service safe I want to.",
    "I have the perfect material for this.",
    "I want to go check a different project, they've done.",
    "Let's see if he's in Recent.",
    "Yes.",
    "This is another project, I did, and I'm thinking this metal is perfect.",
    "I want to see what I used here.",
    "Just.",
    "Shut up iron.",
    "Open.",
    "What are you?",
    "Oh, OK, you smart material here OK.",
    "Perfect again.",
    "I really liked how this how it turned out.",
    "It's nice it's very nice OK.",
    "Stop back over.",
    "To do, don't need to save any changes here.",
    "So I'm gonna look for hold and here we go.",
    "Erica.",
    "Now I can just add a mask, the tire.",
    "Over the entire folder.",
    "I don't do if everything below just perfect.",
    "We could get rid of this one.",
    "No, I think.",
    "Yeah, let me.",
    "See here.",
    "I think it's with all these are.",
    "Normally, I would have these stacked.",
    "But I wanted to have you know?",
    "Keeping them separated just let you be more unique with them.",
    "So each one can look at the little differently aren't the highest resolution.",
    "PDP.",
    "Go in just messed with a different.",
    "Factors here.",
    "Those wheels could go away wheels.",
    "Yeah, I don't have.",
    "From LA to resolution work with her butt.",
    "Should be good enough?",
    "Do we have?",
    "We have colored control, so here we go.",
    "Situation.",
    "Things out like some rest, it looks like.",
    "Will it hard to see what I'm doing on these?",
    "Aural intensity down a bit.",
    "I'm smart material doesn't look like it.",
    "Well, funky alright.",
    "Did I do that?",
    "Yes, I did OK.",
    "Is quite small detail?",
    "Having a little trouble with it, but Getting somewhere.",
    "Really that yourself.",
    "Let's get a quick render see where we're looking.",
    "Just keeping an eye on that iron I think looks alright.",
    "Could have done something more interesting with the geometry there but?",
    "It is what it is this would is looking a little rich all things considered.",
    "But 2 luxurious for you know.",
    "Pretty aesthetic.",
    "I'm going with with a Curt Sue that's easy fix will keep that edge off.",
    "Now.",
    "Give me a little sniffly today.",
    "Is this color panel no all the other ones are the panel?",
    "Oh naming is the hardest part.",
    "I don't know.",
    "It's kind of dark in her name.",
    "I think if it's the same color will just kinda plan into itself but.",
    "Just a shade or 2 right?",
    "That's enough to break it up, I think.",
    "Can pretty so far looking good?",
    "I can good let's.",
    "To this on the back here.",
    "Gonna be the right way.",
    "No, that would've been too good with me if I had the right direction.",
    "Well, actually.",
    "To need to fix old school these site, I don't know panels.",
    "Again, you know, many panels.",
    "Just got duplicate these to clear that mask.",
    "Pop it down here here they do Yanks.",
    "Looks like I have some.",
    "Texture stretching here must've been an oversight Leavis.",
    "I don't think it's worth going back to fix to be honest.",
    "You know what I know exactly where that happen.",
    "No well.",
    "We can make it work.",
    "Topic this real quick.",
    "See I don't see it when it was OK, I was there.",
    "You know what it's not noticeable the sideways and soon sideways.",
    "Supposed to vertical so I'm just going to going to keep it like that.",
    "I'm contemplating having this.",
    "Post rate here in the morning painting, having this, this corner post be like a different would again.",
    "'Cause.",
    "You know if I was like to imagine how this is made right.",
    "This would be its own plank.",
    "These ones would be their own.",
    "Ultimately, we should probably also be there, only going sideways.",
    "Hum.",
    "But I can't be asked.",
    "I don't think you would look that good to be honest.",
    "Maybe if I heard in these edges, where they connect.",
    "You had a little.",
    "Breaking in that might be nice.",
    "Let me try it with this blank real quick.",
    "See how that looks.",
    "So.",
    "This time I'm going to use.",
    "My face tubal here we go.",
    "Jenna scared of all these faces.",
    "Sometimes it's easier to do this in 2D.",
    "Language forgot some metal over here.",
    "OK.",
    "Here's our spot.",
    "Perfect.",
    "Perfect perfect.",
    "I think this would be a good spot to reduce reintroduce this darker wood.",
    "So I'm gonna go ahead and.",
    "Let's see grab one of these uses dark and.",
    "Concert actually I'm just going to do this.",
    "Minus will just have it in the rail section.",
    "Here.",
    "Problem you don't look.",
    "Dark and Alright, OK, I got this.",
    "I know why no biggie.",
    "This is this there, we go.",
    "There we go.",
    "This is its own shell, Yep perfect.",
    "Perfect was it.",
    "Again.",
    "So that's alright see now.",
    "I wish this was just a little books to root it but.",
    "We can probably work that end with a height map.",
    "So let's try that out, 'cause I am what am I doing?",
    "I like I think I like how this looks.",
    "Yeah, OK, yeah, I do, I'm going to start with I'm going to use it down here.",
    "On this, I don't know this extrusion here and that will just help frame it really nicely.",
    "I want to do this.",
    "It's going to be filled there.",
    "'Cause everything is filler.",
    "Be high.",
    "I don't want to be like a?",
    "Nor can color just so I gotta lean view.",
    "Now I think.",
    "OK, there, we go, yeah, so like I was saying, I broke this more seems in this model and I usually would normally like these would probably connected to the bottom down here.",
    "Because they can be, but this time I broke them up there.",
    "We can just pop the materials down like this.",
    "Alternatively, I could have created like an ID mask.",
    "But because I wasn't sure how is going to lay it out ahead of time?",
    "I went I went with this route that we can just change it on the fly.",
    "If that makes sense.",
    "So I'm just thinking right now.",
    "Get the dark and down as well perfect and.",
    "So this is going to be.",
    "I don't know bottom in bottom side sides.",
    "Oh yeah.",
    "Do the same thing clear that mask again.",
    "And I like that name.",
    "You like So.",
    "Hood with 90 degrees of rotation.",
    "There's something like no one would probably receive but.",
    "So let's do this way anyways bottoms.",
    "I don't know banks, they don't know.",
    "Sure.",
    "I'm not great with the name in when you have so many layers like this, it's hard to.",
    "The differentiate each one.",
    "Hello.",
    "No.",
    "I see colors changing up there.",
    "Pete the mask.",
    "So you can go this one layer and you can see specifically where the mask is so I can see I missed scopes.",
    "Super Subs I missed this.",
    "Elsa miss, this man.",
    "Think that sold a mask and I want.",
    "Bring me to color.",
    "There we go.",
    "These sides getting organs.",
    "Must be?",
    "Yeah.",
    "OK.",
    "Come down with the bitter cold or something.",
    "A sore throat.",
    "Sorry for not talking much hello, I think I probably.",
    "Im yammering away.",
    "Kurt is looking good so far OK.",
    "Let's let's finish.",
    "This bottom off and then maybe take a little bit of a break.",
    "Now I'm thinking.",
    "Occured useless same wanna go down.",
    "I don't know, but I also think it may be like.",
    "What if it isn't blanked?",
    "Like this whenever I'm just going to.",
    "Scale for it.",
    "GN news.",
    "Sold would Certain colors so.",
    "So the lighting doesn't matter let's see.",
    "Rotator 90.",
    "It's a good thing to keep in mind when they not your UV's is their orientation.",
    "So if they're all rented on 20 degrees and be kind of a pain to get.",
    "Material like this, where you want to be lined up properly.",
    "Working yeah.",
    "I just use red is like.",
    "It's going to call it a debug color.",
    "It's just so I can.",
    "You know something stands out, I can see where I'm masking.",
    "Probably better to use like?",
    "Yeah, like that color.",
    "It's one that really stands out and now.",
    "It's like unreal use shade like that.",
    "Heard is 'cause like doesn't show up at all in nature, so.",
    "It really pops out, I don't know if that's true but.",
    "It makes for a fun fact.",
    "It.",
    "Oh dear, Oh dear.",
    "So this is one of our missing iron bars.",
    "I think this is just going to go as a.",
    "Now I see material is the other ones so nothing special.",
    "You don't see you, Mister Yeah, hello.",
    "I thought maybe there, we go.",
    "Menu sneaky sneaky sneaky there, we go.",
    "Everything worked out that needs to be marked out.",
    "Let's throw material mode.",
    "Some light.",
    "And would I don't boy Oh boy.",
    "I had spring it below.",
    "Just give it scaled up.",
    "Here we go it's good enough honestly.",
    "It's not special but it doesn't doesn't break anything.",
    "And my allergies are just oof.",
    "Give me a run for my money alright let's get the siren sorted out before I forget.",
    "AM.",
    "Me and I think as the other ones.",
    "Looking good, I can get an similar already OK.",
    "We do this weed eater Weedy Wheels are good to go.",
    "So not sure what I wanted to hear.",
    "CCAC.",
    "More wood.",
    "Wood.",
    "Would would He will.",
    "Would would Yikes today I don't know.",
    "I messed up my UV's.",
    "Where are they?",
    "Where are you I know what happened here?",
    "But this right here.",
    "Good I might be able to get away with it, I might be.",
    "'Cause they ended up Bri mirroring for this.",
    "And I really just like.",
    "Threw everything off.",
    "But I darken the base here and I remember doing it, but",
    "Sure looks like it.",
    "You know, I didn't.",
    "Why are you so much darker?",
    "I don't know.",
    "No biggie.",
    "Are you being?",
    "Think it's been overlaid in mirrored maybe.",
    "Just maybe can find out here.",
    "Yes, it is OK.",
    "Hum.",
    "I don't know if it's worth fixing to be honest.",
    "It's not a hard fix maybe I should.",
    "Adam.",
    "It's OK, if it's mirror in the stretch pit ain't so bad.",
    "As far as I'm curious is why the colors, so far off 'cause.",
    "And I did Oh.",
    "You know it, it was an accident, but I actually like.",
    "The darker bed.",
    "So yeah, it looks like when I was.",
    "Barking the railside at bump the bed, which is Alright.",
    "It's good or mask, yeah, sure did.",
    "Hum.",
    "Actually, like decks and pops out from the.",
    "The sites of it, so let's do the same here.",
    "Just do the whole object.",
    "No, we can't pull shell.",
    "Yes.",
    "Oops.",
    "Kind of why this lineup.",
    "Find Canada now.",
    "It would be the same.",
    "Assuming I didn't ask.",
    "That means the scale.",
    "When I laid out my UV's is different.",
    "Not a huge issue but.",
    "So not.",
    "Not not a problem you know.",
    "Good.",
    "No no no.",
    "I don't think that noticeable.",
    "We got a bit actually in what is good learning experience we got a hard line here.",
    "Let me show you how to deal with seems.",
    "It might this myth that may not work, so great 'cause we got these plank lines.",
    "Hum.",
    "We'll see.",
    "See if I can remember how to do it paint layer.",
    "I think you set it to pass through.",
    "And then you use?",
    "With this clone tool.",
    "Satisfied and then blend away like that.",
    "Ain't perfect, but it will help.",
    "This holding vien clicking a set my source.",
    "Still, going to have a hard line.",
    "For some of the Maps, but like it was good for the color.",
    "Being seen third line still line up and.",
    "Not much I can do about that.",
    "Just do our best to soften ease a little bit mostly where these.",
    "Stains are.",
    "It's clean him out a little.",
    "Truce clean him out there, we go.",
    "You did, Great I like bad.",
    "Like that sums up a lot of my choices.",
    "You know this was like a here proper.",
    "Something that was it just some decoration.",
    "I really go back fix it.",
    "Maybe even incorporate.",
    "Is right now this front piece?",
    "Is a separate peace from the rest of the model?",
    "I did that start I need to add extra divisions to the model or heavenly in guns.",
    "But you know, we gotta say if this is a set piece.",
    "I go back and fix.",
    "It maybe make it part of the model.",
    "But it's not so I won't and it's not so bad.",
    "I don't expect the player or anyone to really get in there, you know, we're going to look at it from.",
    "The distance of Farah now so far away.",
    "Second guessing this would like I don't know if it stands out enough.",
    "Patterns really easy to see them repeating down here, but I don't get cleaned up free dirty it up ironically.",
    "I think it's good.",
    "I had missed it before after gets you know before after not bad.",
    "We spend a little more time do it better, but it's good enough just call it seem Blurt.",
    "Very nice.",
    "Very nice indeed.",
    "Right I don't do thinking if I want to add dirt before doing the rest of the texturing going for about an hour and 15.",
    "Let me put this into 2 parts 'cause I also have.",
    "8 barrel I want to make per texture.",
    "Mister D this bad boy up there.",
    "Let us.",
    "I don't wanna do this normally if it was metal can be arrests.",
    "It's going to pop it through, but it's not.",
    "I've got a nice mud material that.",
    "Maybe good here also a dirt material my work I don't know what I hear.",
    "That and you fill it, see what I got let's see what I got nerfed.",
    "Mud.",
    "Forrest I'm going to have to dig out my materials.",
    "Turn.",
    "See here.",
    "News dirt this one looking forward.",
    "This one.",
    "Great naming scheme.",
    "Just bring it to the current session right here, I get to decide for what to bring it in so all my projects and see.",
    "It just this project or this time, having the window.",
    "Open 'cause I'm not sure if this is the right one.",
    "Don't that way.",
    "1st.",
    "Yikes.",
    "OK, now this is well let's see.",
    "Oh, boy, I remember this one roots, no roots.",
    "All dirt please.",
    "That personally so I'm thinking.",
    "No rocks no pine needles.",
    "With Forrester.",
    "You know there's still look like.",
    "Roots.",
    "I really clampett.",
    "We clamped it clamped to those mistake.",
    "Oh, it's Witcher Hello off.",
    "Look at that I thought of everything.",
    "No, I did I did I know quite what are you?",
    "Either way, I don't know if this is good.",
    "Dirt material anyways.",
    "Saidabad dirt material.",
    "Not great one, but Anything will do just gotta Tyrolese roots.",
    "Who's that song instead?",
    "I think I broke out of my playlist somehow anyone sick.",
    "And be no stop.",
    "OK.",
    "Yes, I like that this is like a?",
    "Happy so dumb.",
    "Roots need to go.",
    "Today really OK so.",
    "And pull up the old designer.",
    "See hot fix this material is an old one, I made this.",
    "Quite some time ago so.",
    "Well.",
    "Let's see.",
    "Might be a little bit.",
    "Not my best work if you don't mean.",
    "This is like over the years, too old.",
    "Now even the water level, they look at all this.",
    "Bring up some water.",
    "This one required heavily on.",
    "Very nice indeed.",
    "Right I don't do thinking if I want to add dirt before doing the rest of the texturing going for about an hour and 15.",

    "Now even the water level, they look at all this.",
    "Bring up some water.",
    "This one required heavily on.",
    "Kind of this material like tessellation in mind.",
    "That's why these roots look so flat, but You know if you bring this into a game engine or something you can tessellate the Heightmap and.",
    "And.",
    "And push it up so it looks nice, then and this would be an OK.",
    "Well, we, we met to speculate it's going to try.",
    "We had a generator just dirt.",
    "In fact, it seems too strong not inverted straight down.",
    "I might not need to go back and fix it.",
    "To kill the height in normals little little bit overwhelming.",
    "Little yeah, see a little I mean extremely.",
    "And see if out of all these parameters.",
    "I bet that's not what I have right.",
    "Of course not, Can edge witness though?",
    "Nice.",
    "I look at me, I have Oh.",
    "I might not need to go back and fix this.",
    "I can set the size here just down there like.",
    "Show me the mascot quicker.",
    "No mask.",
    "There we go OK.",
    "Early is a will there's a way.",
    "Where we have 1/2 decent dirt?",
    "Once again, too bumpy it's OK like on the.",
    "Big flat area here, but Besides I mean?",
    "Gives a nice caked mud affect I guess.",
    "I just want to bring you down just ever so slightly.",
    "I wish we just say you have no height controller.",
    "It's on the right.",
    "Yeah, I just finished some color.",
    "Let's see.",
    "Let's see.",
    "Made perfect in Norman.",
    "There we go.",
    "I know we didn't need to do it multiplier, but honestly that.",
    "It's nice to have this.",
    "This later.",
    "The desert for all of them I'm going to go into each layer individually.",
    "Let's get something slightly bumpy.",
    "Round thinking about it, you can have your height back, I don't think.",
    "You really matters and it looks like it doesn't.",
    "Beautiful and we're going to not generator a black mask.",
    "And then we can throw it on a generator.",
    "Dirt.",
    "It's extreme.",
    "Extreme dirt.",
    "You don't look like you took my.",
    "My suggestion there.",
    "Perkins 'cause the generator.",
    "I feel ya.",
    "No biggie.",
    "One issue.",
    "Is the dirt is a very similar color to the wood so?",
    "It's not really coming across.",
    "Now I have.",
    "2 dirt colors.",
    "Turn off that generator you get a better look now just clear that mass.",
    "We were all together, it's work on the dirt a little more.",
    "This is what I thought was a good color.",
    "Little late think I wanted on the darker side.",
    "So we can just do that thing where we multiply.",
    "I guess another layer.",
    "To be do.",
    "I think if I was to do that I would do like fill here.",
    "Now 'cause it's mask.",
    "DD.",
    "It did did it be.",
    "It wasn't the normal is the height map was in it.",
    "Sure was Silly me.",
    "Silly silly.",
    "OK, that makes a lot more sense water was going on and goes crazy little bit crazy, but you know.",
    "To that level geez OK?",
    "Dirt power here.",
    "Let's get some more crunch.",
    "Well, it might be too much.",
    "This was looking a little bit shiny, 2, I'm going to go back and drop down the roughness.",
    "Really happy with this so far.",
    "You happy need.",
    "And another thing I can do is throw down a pount layer's not that.",
    "And I can hand paint some stuff too.",
    "And also how to remove a?",
    "Let me do that a little bit of hand paint.",
    "I don't have my.",
    "Tablet setup right now, so it's not going to be the best.",
    "Let it will be nonetheless there.",
    "Going to grab a nice dirt brush.",
    "Something like that, we're just gonna.",
    "These corners, I think are little bit too.",
    "Say predictable I don't know that.",
    "Not what I mean by that exactly but.",
    "You know.",
    "Don't really don't think like you can really picture dirt or mud getting up there.",
    "Be very you know just.",
    "You know we could even do.",
    "Each night look terrible.",
    "This current stamp in this year in there.",
    "Is we could?",
    "Shut down an Alpha of like foot.",
    "Yes, for make more sense than a shoe.",
    "Considering for the time.",
    "And then we can like.",
    "Have it selects owners walking on their you know get some mud around.",
    "I've got Jalen stuff on right now.",
    "Turn all that off.",
    "I probably won't like how this looks.",
    "But I thought it would be.",
    "An interesting idea, yeah, I know I don't have.",
    "Have a good sense of scale.",
    "I did model this against the person but.",
    "Their little man's not here right now, so it's a little tough.",
    "To tell.",
    "So Congress.",
    "Can you throw down some mud?",
    "This present next to switch year end.",
    "Delete or I think there might be a little too much.",
    "Switching back to get a little bit more.",
    "I know, but she did for awhile 'cause like playlist is repeated isn't it.",
    "Can I add more songs?",
    "I see this would be a little bit easier to do with a tablet but.",
    "It certainly get by without one.",
    "You know, maybe Give me the farmers had somebody hands and he's always grabbing.",
    "Curve in this right here.",
    "Fairly recent comes up and.",
    "Most the peak in the cart takes a look like that.",
    "Or maybe that would clean away the dirt and we have little spots without it.",
    "For Little hands girl you know.",
    "Stuff like that.",
    "Thank goodness for out of safe 'cause Man Oh man.",
    "I'm always forgetting.",
    "I am Really, like, how it's come together.",
    "Knows it.",
    "This is thing texturing is.",
    "Early on it's like goof I don't know about this.",
    "Once you add these fine details.",
    "You know get some dirt that brings it to life mean nothing is clean, specially not old stuff.",
    "So once you start, adding The Dirty late OK.",
    "On a serious coming together right now, I'm just kind of shaking my hand.",
    "This place with little bit of random.",
    "I mean, it's good.",
    "Got these settings here do that randomize the position the size and.",
    "The rotation of the brush only doesn't look uniform, which is exactly what you want, but Really old shaky hand does the job, too or helps at least?",
    "No maybe the dirt goes a little bit higher on this backside 'cause.",
    "The cart would lift up right and so someone's caring it.",
    "They lifted up all the dirt slides right back.",
    "Maybe that's what we got going on.",
    "It is really put you know, maybe some Hey, maybe that's like caring dirt around.",
    "So how much do I put in here probably that.",
    "Hey we can even throw some dirt on here.",
    "Right right terribly vien.",
    "Looking pretty good.",
    "Set up a little.",
    "You could look less like crime scene.",
    "I wanna bring it up on the walls again.",
    "Very nice now we can use this time to address like I don't know if you guys can see these patterns, but rate here repeats here repeats he repeats here can use this dirt just to break that up.",
    "Had my repeating texture.",
    "Looking good.",
    "Really after that have is turning out so far.",
    "Picking longer than I expected, but honestly.",
    "No biggie.",
    "I enjoy it anyways.",
    "Bill.",
    "Throw down a Part 2 tomorrow as well.",
    "Hey looking pretty good, I think.",
    "It's dirty this side up down.",
    "Oops.",
    "Little bit shiny on the word I think not.",
    "May be worth fixing maybe not I don't know.",
    "Probably worth fixing.",
    "You know, I think that's a good layer of dirt and let's just.",
    "Get some quick before and after is just so you get the idea of like how important.",
    "Messing up your stuff is like it just really.",
    "I mean, it's night and day this looks good about giving wrong.",
    "I like how this looks but.",
    "Through that dirt on it looks real.",
    "If I say so myself item me back to my own horn but.",
    "I like it.",
    "My leg is so much more than a little bit more.",
    "Look at this first panel looks I don't want them all that dirty butt.",
    "Make a femur in that state would be good.",
    "Don't wanna lose that sense, if.",
    "Rihanna miss, though I don't want to let the uniform.",
    "Prime makes a little more sense heaven concentrated the bottom.",
    "If I was imagining it imagining it, it would be.",
    "No maybe trainee covered in mud all the mud search dripping down Lansing these corners.",
    "This thing grab those kind of things you're texturing.",
    "Really helps just add another layer.",
    "Respect side looks clean, Huh, it's no good.",
    "Naked dirt.",
    "Watch video.",
    "So much truth.",
    "Too much dirt.",
    "Which is why we go back and take away?",
    "Given we take here.",
    "Even we take.",
    "Still, not much.",
    "Maybe this corner here is always sitting in the dirt right 'cause.",
    "To 2 real card?",
    "Well, actually I should sit forward so maybe not so much.",
    "Maybe not so much.",
    "But that just tells me that these parts right here, probably quite messy, maybe a little Polish from all the.",
    "But grabbing with their hands.",
    "I am happy with this.",
    "Now we've been going for almost 2 hours here.",
    "But it just flew by.",
    "This is so.",
    "So easy and relax now here we go time to cover up all those darn marks.",
    "To stand out so much.",
    "I was talking about earlier really just hide it all over the dirt.",
    "Anything you don't like.",
    "Dirt it away.",
    "Not that dirt.",
    "Dirt dirt dirt dirt.",
    "OK.",
    "Looking pretty good.",
    "And be ready to call it.",
    "Thinking of this Kurt needs anything else, I guess.",
    "Maybe a touch up the old roughness while I'm thinking about it and we can just do this.",
    "The same way we did the height and darken.",
    "Turn to fill.",
    "Only the roughness.",
    "And How do I want to multiply?",
