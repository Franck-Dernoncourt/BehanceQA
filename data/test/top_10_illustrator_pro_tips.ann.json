    "Alright, Hello there everyone, you should be able to see me.",
    "It's good to see you everybody that's out there.",
    "I see you artful thank you for saying hello.",
    "Feel free to.",
    "It's good to have you here and let me know where you're from.",
    "Hello Alright we're gonna get started I thought I'd do a Top 10 list if that works for you.",
    "Top ten illustrator pro tips.",
    "Things that I use like a lot that helped me out alot so.",
    "That is the plan.",
    "So Farook and everyone.",
    "Let's get into this.",
    "Feel free to say hello in chat.",
    "Would love to hear from you.",
    "So let me just go ahead and switch screens.",
    "As you can see here.",
    "Sure enough, I'm in illustrator.",
    "That's right, I'm trapped in illustrator.",
    "There we go finally seeing some names.",
    "Dohan Nikki Brandy, Robin.",
    "Hello from Detroit to get to have you here from Chile as well.",
    "Fantastic, that's what I'm talking about.",
    "Did a bunch of pro tips.",
    "Have a bunch of projects lined up for you, so let's get into this Steve.",
    "What's up?",
    "Benjamin cool.",
    "Sandy from Miami.",
    "Hum.",
    "UK in the House Indiana Alright, Malaysia cool well let me make this worth your time.",
    "We're going to do my top there we go.",
    "Top ten illustrator tips first one I actually use is going full screen and hiding everything in illustrator because this is a fairly new but we go to window, there's presentation mode and I know it doesn't have a shortcut next to it, but basically it's shift F will bring you into presentation mode, 'cause chances are you have all this junk on the sides.",
    "Like logos and copies of text and things like that and this just makes it look more presentable as you kind of present your design, so that's typically what I'll do.",
    "I'll remove those, that's my just first quick tip since I was presenting this slide.",
    "Now let's get into this.",
    "So another thing that you might run into, and I'm going to select all of this text and I'll go over here and I'll just pick a color right?",
    "And let's crank up that color a lot right under my properties panel.",
    "Check out the stroke.",
    "Make sure that stroke is on the outside as well, but this is what you run into.",
    "It's like, hey, you know what.",
    "It looks fine, and maybe I'll just kind of.",
    "I don't know.",
    "Make it a little brighter.",
    "I would love to throw a little pink in there.",
    "That's what it needs.",
    "It needs to be a little more pink.",
    "There we go right?",
    "This is the problem.",
    "This is what happens.",
    "You run into this the it's no longer filled, right?",
    "the T isn't flowing into the R and all that good stuff so this is a problem.",
    "So what people typically do?",
    "Is no break up the text right?",
    "You'll go in here and you'll create outlines.",
    "You can't edit it anymore.",
    "It's a huge issue actually, but you will like make it 1 solid object.",
    "But again you can't edit it.",
    "So that's the problem.",
    "So what you need to do in this case is select your text down here in your parents panel you want to.",
    "Hopefully you can see that it's kind of small appearance panel right down here you want to click right here, add a new fill right?",
    "And this is where you overlay.",
    "That with white and guess what?",
    "It is still editable.",
    "As we can see, right?",
    "So that's what you want to do.",
    "Use the appearance panel, add a fill over it in.",
    "Your text is still going to be editable.",
    "Cool Papa new Guinean House.",
    "Good to see you.",
    "Uh Michael J Welch, Awesome Serbia, everybody's here so this is really fun for me.",
    "I'm going to do a quick night scene.",
    "OK, I have this text right here that is fine.",
    "Right, let's just put all that text on its own layer.",
    "Why not paste in place?",
    "And let's just hide that 'cause I want to actually get into using the pencil right over here.",
    "The pencil tool here it is just hit N for pencil right?",
    "And you have these different settings so we can go from accurate to smooth, right?",
    "And you can turn on a number of items in here, but I'm going to make this just like a Meadow scene, right?",
    "So like.",
    "Landscape and I'll keep it actually at accurate, right?",
    "Initially I'll click OK.",
    "Let's pick a nice color, just like a gradient, and now I can make like jagged mountains and every single jagged point I have is going to give me a vector point, right?",
    "Like that will just kind of dragged down to the bottom.",
    "I'm just using a mouse, will connect that like so right?",
    "And there we have all of those points as expected.",
    "Right, but that's what I use.",
    "I use these options for my my designing right.",
    "I'll have it kind of catch a little bit of that light like so, right?",
    "And that's what I have right there?",
    "Those jagged mountains.",
    "The cool thing is, if I would decide I want to redraw any part of this, write a lot of people actually don't know this, but check this out as I roll over this line, it says, hey, you know what you can edit this part of this line, so you could just draw and get rid of that point like that, so you can redraw and reshape.",
    "This all you want just by drawing over it super easy.",
    "Hopefully you get the idea, but that's what I would do.",
    "There we go in this case.",
    "As I start to make this scene hit N for pencil, we're going to take it up A notch.",
    "Just one we can draw some more Hills, right?",
    "Some rolling Hills into a Valley like that.",
    "This will give me less points.",
    "Will see that come through in a second right gives me those sort of like less points as well so again I'm just creating this nice mountain range layer by layer, right?",
    "We're going to get into this a little bit more.",
    "Taking this down on this smooth Inns clicking OK?",
    "And then just kind of drawing out another sort of Ridge if you will.",
    "You get the idea.",
    "I'm just playing with the pencil tool makes life easy for me, but I want to get into more of my pro tips 'cause I have a lot I need to talk about.",
    "But again, I'm just kind of setting up a nice little scene, right?",
    "Controlling these pencil tool making.",
    "It may be jagged and all that detail when you need it and then when you don't need all that detail.",
    "Hey guess what?",
    "Just change it over to smooth as you can see in this case.",
    "I do want this to be a little more smooth, maybe not quite that smooth, but again, just kind of redrawing that part.",
    "You get the idea.",
    "OK, let's move on.",
    "I got other things to show you.",
    "How was there a moon in here really fast?",
    "Just 'cause I.",
    "I would like one in here right?",
    "Maybe a little gradient like that.",
    "OK, maybe changing these colors as well.",
    "Let's change this to a white right and it could fade down into maybe a little bit of purple.",
    "I don't know something like that, just kind of adding to it.",
    "Alright, we can do.",
    "We can do that, sure, alright?",
    "Have that done.",
    "I could throw a glow in here using graphic styles.",
    "Just give it a nice glow and then we have our nice moon that's going to light up this this landscape, but I want to put some stars in here now.",
    "You ready sand up from Croatia.",
    "Awesome, Rodrigo.",
    "Fantastic, let's get into this so many tips.",
    "Let's take a look at this.",
    "Let's take a look at the star of either way.",
    "I'll go into the star tool and sometimes you're thinking Oh, a star.",
    "do I really want this exact star?",
    "Well, we can come in here and we can always as I drag out, I can toggle between different points so I can make this 789 pointed star just by hitting the up and down arrows is all I'm doing.",
    "Also, if you hold down the option key you'll get a true star like so.",
    "So I just gave this a true star.",
    "Look if you will.",
    "Let's get rid of this really fast.",
    "Get rid of that outer glow.",
    "Hum kind of deciding if I even want this, I don't know, but really I need to fill the Sky with this with a bunch of stars, so I'll use this one.",
    "I also drew out this one that I kind of like as well.",
    "We could see it off to the side right here, right?",
    "I might consider using it.",
    "I don't know.",
    "I'm not sure which one I'm going to use, but.",
    "You know what I can actually make a scatter brush with both and I use brushes all the time, so let's grab this star.",
    "Let's drop it in here.",
    "Let's make it a scatter brush.",
    "Click OK and this is what usually will happen.",
    "It actually you can't have gradients when it comes to scatter brushes.",
    "So That being said, and I wanted to point that out to you, change it to white.",
    "Go into brushes.",
    "That is typically the added element.",
    "Let's drag it in their scatter brush.",
    "Click OK.",
    "Guess what?",
    "We can scatter both sides.",
    "OK so will have this.",
    "Size be random, right?",
    "Maybe 80, you know.",
    "Actually, let's make it really small.",
    "10% the size we could make it a little larger as well.",
    "152% the size play with the spacing being random on both sides of the line and you just going to want to play with a lot of these numbers and be sensitive to how much it's going to scatter it right again random like so actually.",
    "No, I don't want to rotate it.",
    "Rotation is going to be fixed, will click OK.",
    "Will hit N 4.",
    "Pencil or I could use the pen, but here's the star that I have.",
    "I can draw out that line like so when we get a bunch of stars using this scatter brush.",
    "Here is what happens you ready for this?",
    "Let me know if you have questions.",
    "Good to see everybody in here, but this is pretty cool so I just threw out all these stars with this scatter brush.",
    "But the problem is like if I go over here and I want to draw add more stars over here.",
    "Right, I have to go back in and select that brush like each time so it's a pain.",
    "It's like I gotta draw this other line, select that brush, give me a break, right?",
    "I don't really want to do that.",
    "Actually.",
    "what I want to do is I want it to always keep the appearance.",
    "So right down here.",
    "Let me check.",
    "I live, I'm live.",
    "Write down here, I'm gonna turn off.",
    "New art has basic appearance so don't default to that basic line appearance right?",
    "Just give me the stars or the last used apparent every time I draw right?",
    "That makes it much easier.",
    "And by the way, all these stars are actually being controlled by the strokes so I can change the stroke of these as well.",
    "If I get them all selected, selecting uh, let's just grab say this line right here, right?",
    "Taking that point size down a little bit.",
    "As you can tell, right?",
    "Taking that down a little bit, just changing the size of those stars.",
    "OK, you get the idea.",
    "We made stars.",
    "That was fun.",
    "Let's move on, alright?",
    "Ha ha ha.",
    "That's funny, uh.",
    "Do you have to create a new brush for the star effects?",
    "Yes, I did create a new brush right over here, right.",
    "Anne, I have about 1000 brushes in here that I end up using a lot so that's why one of my tips is basically using brushes.",
    "'cause again I use them all the time.",
    "Even this one.",
    "This is a fun one.",
    "Like if I wanted to have a snake in here, there's my fun little snake that's also a brush as well.",
    "Right now we can kind of redraw whatever we want to do in that case.",
    "Cool alright?",
    "Let's get rid of that.",
    "Let's move on another fun thing.",
    "Since we made this starlets kind of have some fun with this really fast right?",
    "Let's jump over here.",
    "Let's grab.",
    "Hours fun gradient.",
    "I'm going to do this.",
    "This is just kind of a fun tip I have.",
    "I'm going to make this star OK, but I'm going to hold down the tilde key and let me undo that.",
    "Oh, that's really trippy.",
    "Oh, that's awesome.",
    "Let's turn that off.",
    "But all I have is this one line, so let's just increase this.",
    "Let's do this ready.",
    "Pull down the tilde key and then click and drag.",
    "And as you can see, you're going to create duplicates of that particular star, right?",
    "That's pretty trippy, right?",
    "Just the tilde key click and drag when you create a star.",
    "Kind of fun.",
    "All right?",
    "Let's Scroll down.",
    "So again, that's a super fun, but the tilde key does more things I want to get into that later.",
    "By the way, notice how it created individual stars right in here, but I could always change this anyway.",
    "I want, which is really fun.",
    "OK, so let's remove that brushes.",
    "Here's another fun one.",
    "Let's turn on this stuff.",
    "So these are just like pro tips and tricks probably for these stars actually.",
    "Let's do this.",
    "Select same.",
    "Selecting the same stroke color properties, I'm just going to change this to overlay.",
    "Oh yeah, there we go, just change that mode to overlay.",
    "Just making it look kind of like a fun story scene.",
    "But what I want to do is I want to add a new layer and I'm going to show you what we can do with the.",
    "A simple ellipse 'cause actually what I want to do is I want to have these Rays of light shooting out from this moon, right?",
    "So right now I just drew a circle and we could see this line right here.",
    "So see this line.",
    "We have this nice thick line.",
    "Properties panel you can see this 23 point.",
    "We could make it 60, but check this out.",
    "This is the cool thing as we go into these stroke.",
    "We can change this to a dashed line, so will change that to a dash line.",
    "Will give it a 20 points with a 20 gap like so we can up this 240 right?",
    "And now we're getting these crazy bands and let's really crank this up now as well.",
    "OK, let's go up to 100 right?",
    "Let's change this to 500.",
    "Boom there we have this awesome.",
    "These awesome like Rays of light.",
    "And will again change this to say overlay for instance.",
    "And now we just have this.",
    "It's like burst coming out from.",
    "It's a little intense.",
    "I might need to change it a little bit more, but this burst is just kind of coming out from from that sun and it's a little intense.",
    "I get it.",
    "I probably want to change that a little bit.",
    "Let's do just some nice softly.",
    "It drop down the opacity.",
    "Kind of like that.",
    "Right?",
    "And even move it behind.",
    "Some of the other things, so let's grab my moon.",
    "Let's make sure my moon.",
    "I think I actually have a blend mode on that move blend mode on that moon, but you get the idea cool.",
    "Easy enough, illustrator is saving, so let's have it do its thing.",
    "Wait for it, wait for it again, just fun bursts.",
    "I can outline this and use it like anything else.",
    "I would actually have that trail out by the way.",
    "But let's just size this up a little bit.",
    "There we go.",
    "There we go, let's do something like that.",
    "Cool, that works so far.",
    "OK, let's go into.",
    "Some other fun things we can do.",
    "So many things we can do.",
    "Yeah, let's dive into this.",
    "Let's add a texture over the tops lot of times what I'll do is I'll grab.",
    "I don't know, just a if I want to add some texture to this I can grab a rectangle, go into say affect Gallery for this rectangle and choose something like film grain.",
    "So this is what I'll do 'cause I want to give it.",
    "I don't want to make it look like the everything that you see that coming out of illustrator or it doesn't have any texture, but I'm just adding film grain to this.",
    "We can control the graininess as well, right?",
    "We're expecting that click OK, right?",
    "Keep in mind I can apply this to every object, but really I like to make it a layer over the top of everything to give it just a nice film grain.",
    "So putting that over everything as you can see taking that down right there, wait for it again.",
    "It is a lovely filter and let's change the blend mode.",
    "Again, to something like overlay we could try and now we just have this nice texture.",
    "Right, hopefully you can see that you see that texture just creates a nice texture for this particular seed, so I'm into it.",
    "Alright, stop touching my face that is funny.",
    "Wash your hands.",
    "Ah.",
    "So cool we can kind of step ahead, in fact.",
    "We can even see this version that I made earlier, right?",
    "We can see kind of a lot of those similar properties as we'd expect, but I might consider recoloring this as well, and that's why I love recolor artwork.",
    "I can start with this original one, I'll lock down that that texture.",
    "Let's just select everything.",
    "Let's go into edit, edit colors, and recolor artwork right there.",
    "Already think the colors are pretty good.",
    "But you can easily see how we could jump in, may be locked down each of these color stop, so they are also going to be related and we can try some different scenes and we can go from day two night and change this.",
    "So drastically, if we want to again going from night today in a pretty smooth move in general, right and always unlocking those colors, shifting it a little bit more, I can have some more dynamic range of colors.",
    "This works on anything showing you that they work on gradients.",
    "They can work on more things.",
    "If I decide I want to even have some free form gradients, which is also one of my pro tips in here as I select this.",
    "This sun, right?",
    "I should really make something else, but again, let's just take this.",
    "This just has a linear gradient on it.",
    "Has an outer glow OK, it actually has a just a gradient going from.",
    "White to transparent, so that's all that's happening.",
    "It's just that gradient, right?",
    "But let's go in here.",
    "Let's select this color range.",
    "For instance, I'll go into my gradient panel, pull this out, right look, I don't even need all these color stops.",
    "Let's pull those off, right?",
    "Let's take this one.",
    "Let's shift it more yellow and have this one.",
    "A little brighter, for instance, but really what I want to do is I want to show you this right in here we want to make a free form and gradient clicking right there.",
    "I should have drawn a bird or something else, but will just deal with this because I could.",
    "I could have a radial gradient, but really what I want is I might want to have a highlight on this side.",
    "So right over here will have a white there on this for this point right here?",
    "Adding yellow like so and then for this bottom part we can dive into really tweaking this.",
    "Into the color that I want, right, like?",
    "So.",
    "Let's get it away from that.",
    "There we go added this other Third Point right down here.",
    "By the way, I can make a line too, so clicking right here we can make a line so.",
    "Lines click.",
    "Click.",
    "Click and now it's going to create that smooth curve and this could kind of be more like a shadow, giving this a little bit more depth.",
    "Haha Alright.",
    "Now you guys are being funny.",
    "Alright, so you get the idea.",
    "Not crazy about this, but I did want to show you.",
    "The ability to add freeform gradients.",
    "I probably could have done it on a bird in here or something, but you get the idea and here's kind of the final illustration.",
    "Let me.",
    "I think that is it.",
    "OK, uh.",
    "Fantastic, do you guys have any question how to combine shapes?",
    "We do that all day long I did it with these clouds right in here when we start combining shapes let me lock down everything and just play with a new layer right?",
    "So we do this with the clouds.",
    "Super easy to do, will make sure that it's just going to be white coming here.",
    "Boom boom, let's just add a couple.",
    "Circles like so OK we can select all three of these and we could easily use this shape builder tool right shape builder let's us to kind of determine what to keep and want to take away.",
    "But I can combine these two circles like that, combining that little part like so combining that over there, you get the idea.",
    "Throw gradient on there and that set up so you get the idea.",
    "Thank you, Angela.",
    "Thank you everyone.",
    "I think I've gone for.",
    "A while now.",
    "And.",
    "Yeah, so I could you could see how I did this tree.",
    "By the way somebody's asking about doing the tree.",
    "I can unlock it.",
    "Yeah, these are just simple spheres.",
    "There's nothing really too complex about it by the way, just three simple spheres right down here.",
    "We just have this, you know, base for it, so I don't really know.",
    "I think what's clever about this actually is right down here.",
    "Adding the shadow.",
    "So what is this?",
    "Will guess?",
    "What if we go in the properties panel?",
    "Or even my appearance panel?",
    "Let's get rid of this in my appearance panel you can see that there's a Gaussian blur for that shadow, so I'll turn that off and you can see.",
    "It's just that tree shape with a gradient on it, and the blurred sells it a little bit more and makes it look nice and I should probably put it underneath the tree, but that's OK.",
    "You get the idea cool, I think that's about it.",
    "There's more tips I have, but that's all I got for you right now.",
    "Yeah, this is another thing I would do.",
    "Another fun thing actually would be to add patterns on some of this stuff, so this is another thing I'd think about since we were talking about texture, let me just grab this.",
    "I can go over the parents panel and I can add a new fill and in this case I'm going to add.",
    "Sort of just a different sort of grain, so we have all these different options for these different little dots that we can add for this week and take this down to like soft light.",
    "OG is no not not quite overlay.",
    "You're not really seeing it darn it.",
    "Let's just keep it normal, right?",
    "But what I could do here is I can control.",
    "The density of this particular pattern so I can grab the scale tool and this is my last tip.",
    "Then I'm done or the rotate tool, but I could grab the scale tool and hold down the tilde key, right?",
    "It's the Squiggly Little Line, and I can click and drag and make that pattern tighter, right?",
    "Like that just by holding down the tilde key, right?",
    "Same thing for rotation if I decide I want to rotate it differently.",
    "Holding down the tilde key will allow you to rotate the pattern and not the object itself.",
    "Alright, which is super helpful, and again, let's take down this.",
