    "I measured as he difference in creating just for fun and when you have to do a project for work purposes, yeah there is.",
    "Because when it's just for you, you're the only art director, so it's just you, and sometimes that can actually be harder.",

    "I don't know what colors are going to use yet, so we're just going to run with us and see how things go.",
    "Really, really.",
    "Two textured, let's see if I do.",

    "Um?",
    "'cause I don't want this to be dark.",
    "I want it to be nice and warm.",

    "I was playing with techniques practice, so I'm just going to try to implement them here and see if it works.",
    "Um?",
    "I'm at a point right now.",
    "We're like, I know I can see in my head what I want my art to grow up to be.",
    "And.",
    "Like stylistically, and how I render it, but I need to learn the render techniques in order to make that happen, so I'm in a weird Limbo.",
    "You have chick in baking in the oven and salad ready to go with it.",
    "Yum.",
    "I had a charcuterie tray last night, just 'cause I didn't hit that point where I.",
    "Waited too long to eat.",
    "And so I didn't have like I didn't have the energy or the will to cook anything.",
    "And I would also like.",
    "As having anxiety attack last night I was.",
    "Having one a little while ago.",
    "I'm not sure what is triggering them this week there just.",
    "They're very prevalent.",
    "Which is why I have to drink some Wine.",
    "'cause That's the only thing I have right now to take it down.",
    "And.",
    "So I did that last night and that was that helped and so I had a charcuterie tray.",
    "Who was the only thing I could get myself to make, and then I munched on that and play Animal Crossing.",
    "Um?",
    "Hi fresh cake, how are you?",
    "Mark, I definitely have a question.",
    "Why not outline and fill as opposed to brushing the whole fill?",
    "OK so I'm gonna show you what happens with my brushes.",
    "So you see how there's this nice little deckled edge here?",
    "If I do that, you see there's a lot of texture in there and I still.",
    "It just looks.",
    "Right?",
    "And then if I do that, it just black and.",
    "So part of it is just like it's an aesthetic thing.",
    "I just don't like how it looks if I if I fill it in.",
    "Yeah.",
    "I'm going to.",
    "I'm going to rasterize layer style so in my layers down here at the correct color.",
    "And their impulse will darker and I'm going to pull.",
    "I made a few brushes before this stream so I could do like transparencies and stuff.",
    "Hum.",
    "Which like if you guys want them, let me know.",
    "Three of them are not my own, so I can't.",
    "I can't share three of them.",
    "Um?",
    "But I can give you mine if you want them.",
    "One of them is.",
    "Two of them are Quiles.",
    "Those come with Adobe said probably share those out, but I'm not going to.",
    "I will tell you though, on some of them if you have to turn of- build up, which is why I have them saved out separately 'cause I had to turn off build up.",
    "Because I was getting some weird stamping prior to every stroke.",
    "Hum.",
    "There is that I can show you actually.",
    "And then the other one is one fight.",
    "Jamie sketch and they have fantastic brushes.",
    "OK, system has OK, here we go.",
    "So see how this one here has built up selected this is Kyle's buttery ankaran every stroke you see how it's stamping you turn it of.-",
    "And it doesn't happen.",
    "So if you're having that issue with any of your brushes.",
    "You just have to turn off build up and then save the brush out separately.",
    "Which is annoying, but you know it's it's something to do with, I think a new update so.",
    "I've also this glitch where it turns off your.",
    "Um?",
    "Your pressure sensitivity, and I'm not sure how to fix and that one.",
    "Most of the sort of guessing where the.",
    "Shadow school right now 'cause I can fix it later.",
    "I feel like I need to make this a little bit warmer.",
    "Somerset throw saturation layer on here.",
    "Yeah, that feels a little better.",
    "I assume you're saying I'm never experimented much with brushes outside of default settings, be at I am.",
    "When?",
    "I started freelancing.",
    "I hadn't either.",
    "The way I used to do.",
    "My lettering work, especially early on was I would do it all by hand with pencil and.",
    "Um?",
    "I did all this by hand with pencil and then I would.",
    "Use a light box and trace it and then I would scan it and then I would take it in Photoshop and I'd invert and I do whatever you need to do.",
    "And then I discovered Kyle's brushes.",
    "Since I started playing with those.",
    "And that opened up a whole New World of possibilities for me.",
    "And then over that time I started to.",
    "Learn how to kind of manipulate them and change them up so they did what I needed, needed and wanted them to do.",
    "Um?",
    "And that made.",
    "All the difference and I started doing work completely.",
    "Completely in Totale Analog.",
    "In that or I did it all digitally, so I started playing with brushes like.",
    "Seven years ago.",
    "And they really, really helped a lot.",
    "I would live in that Hobbit hole looks cozy.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Fresh cake.",
    "And you love the birds.",
    "And if you want the bird sound, I linked him in the.",
    "Thing I don't know what you're actually has a point.",
    "They are linked in the description.",
    "I'm gonna end up keeping these outlines in here, but eventually I'm going to go over this and like fill in them selectively.",
    "Um?",
    "I think with this I think I need to fill this in like with that versus transparencies to start, so I'm going to.",
    "I'm going to select this color and then I'm going to try to pull it.",
    "Make an orangey Brown.",
    "Yes.",
    "And if you need to erase things, you can hit the.",
    "There's this key up in the top right corner, top left corner of the keyboard.",
    "And if you hold that down while you're painting or drawing with your brush, it'll turn your.",
    "Filtering your brush into any racer so you can keep your.",
    "You can keep the texture going.",
    "Like, well, end up doing once we get a little further along with this is all start.",
    "Like painting this out, but I'm going to do it with one of the transparent brushes.",
    "Wrong button.",
    "Um?",
    "So it gives it like kind of softer edge.",
    "You can see here how it's like.",
    "It's masking it out really slowly.",
    "And there's fits that.",
    "I'll have to go back in and do on the other one.",
    "I like so I could do that, or in theory I could also.",
    "Um?",
    "Create a new layer.",
    "And I can just paint.",
    "With White Over it, as well as an option.",
    "And then I just paint baby.",
    "Oh nice, I'll take a look.",
    "Just stand your Instagram with legs lol.",

    "Thank you.",
    "I actually don't think I will, I'm.",
    "I'm doing like Oh I have.",
    "Would you look at that?",
    "I have built up no wonder I saw a stamp happening.",
    "Do all of mine have?",
    "All of these have oh.",
    "I thought I turned that off.",
    "Dang it, now I'll take care of that later.",
    "I yeah, I thought about it, but I'm trying to create things that.",
    "Are less from lion on typography, so like I can still do typography, but I want to get the hang of this and then.",
    "Eventually I will combine both illustration, an watering into a harmonious.",
    "Money is a moment.",
    "So let's go back to here.",
    "I'm going to copy this.",
    "I'm going to go in and I'm going to turn off, build up creating new brush.",
    "Delete the original.",
    "There OK, and then I'll do the others later as I even need them.",

    "Yeah, I love Alan Watts his.",
    "He's got, uh.",
    "Quite a few quotes that I really resonate with and.",
    "Help me get by.",
    "There's one in particular, but like it's his piece about the mind.",
    "And anytime.",
    "Really struggling, I pull that up and I listen to that.",
    "Where it tells you to focus on last song you know, trying to force everything to stop in your brain and instead just.",
    "Let it.",
    "Let it happen because it'll quite itself.",
    "Um?",
    "As long as you give it enough time.",
    "If you haven't heard it, I implore you to.",
    "Go on.",
    "On YouTube and look up Alan Watts the mind.",
    "It's worth it.",
    "It's really worth it.",
    "Yeah, and it's in.",
