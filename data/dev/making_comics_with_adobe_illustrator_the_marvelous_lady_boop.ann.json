    "All right?",
    "Good morning.",
    "Alright, so let me get my headphones here here, not cooperating.",
    "There we go.",
    "Now we good.",
    "Alright, so today I am working on um comics so Thursday are comics.",
    "Panthers day is Thomas de on defense and today's comic is the return of a character that I've had in the comics just once.",
    "It's a lady bug that likes to fly around and boot noses.",
    "So I don't know if anybody reading my comics would remember her.",
    "I only did one, but I've always intended to do more with that character and let me show.",
    "Let's see I think I've got it right here.",
    "It's right about here.",
    "Yeah.",
    "So this is the first one that I had her in.",
    "She heard her Senses are tingling and she Springs up and she flies around in boots, mochi on the nose.",
    "So I've intended to do more with her and I really kind of I like her.",
    "She's a little ladybug and she's only just to force it positively so.",
    "In today's comic, I have her observing that coconut is really stressed out and so she Springs into action.",
    "She lands on her head and then instead of grouping Earth on the head, she produces a note that says, I believe in you.",
    "So I think it's a nice simple message and I can do things like that and have this character and come back and kind of, you know, support the other characters since yesterday how had time to take a look at Instagram to add a few small?",
    "It's alright, yes.",
    "I appreciate the support.",
    "I did last night I posted the color for the volume to cover.",
    "Actually let me go ahead and show that on stream let me just go ahead and open that file up.",
    "I was so happy with how this turned out.",
    "It's uh.",
    "It just I don't know I I wanted to brighten up the color a little bit.",
    "Uhm, and because on the last cover it was a little bit desaturated.",
    "I don't know.",
    "I just.",
    "I wanted to change it and kind of subtle ways, but I wanted to still have a cast of characters on there and have the general same feeling of being outside walking through the Woods and experiencing the world together.",
    "So the first one is the they're having a picnic in the Meadow and.",
    "It was interesting at the time I drew this one, the floof characters weren't that big in the comics, but since then I've drawn them quite a bit so they are now more of a central character.",
    "And so I had to add them to the front cover and make them more central.",
    "and I realized I forgot, um, spring bear and Berry on the front, but honestly, I didn't have any comics with very in it.",
    "He yeah, no, I haven't had any yet, so.",
    "Besides, you know the ones I started with, so I did have spring bear.",
    "I may add her in the background of Sanlu, but for now this is the final cover and dumb.",
    "Come but yeah.",
    "Boyfriend about it came wroxeter.",
    "How are you welcome?",
    "Welcome.",
    "I just showing the last thing I did I don't have cleaning.",
    "Goodnight Hello.",
    "Thank you that's not helping much, so I'm going to leave it off.",
    "I might turn it on later.",
    "But OK, so yes.",
    "Now I'm working on this comic, so this is going to be probably split into 12345678 panels plus the.",
    "Final info panel.",
    "So I've gone over this a couple times.",
    "When I create comics I'm thinking about not only the regular post on, you know, let's say Facebook, Twitter my website, which would be this more of a vertical format, but I'm also thinking about how to post them on Instagram, which is a 10 panel swipe so when.",
    "Little bit.",
    "So I kind of have to keep that in mind, and when I'm splitting up these panels, I've gotta figure out.",
    "OK, so this is going to be a continuous wide and then these I can split apart 'cause these.",
    "No problem here and see even this.",
    "All of these are going to be fine.",
    "This I'm not going to split into two, I'll just make it 1 even though.",
    "In reference to everything else on the page, it takes up a 2 panel.",
    "I don't think it's necessary necessary for Instagram, so I'm just keeping that in mind and their other platforms like you know, webtoons and topos.",
    "I know webtoons they prefer lyca mobile format, so you're going to be scrolling vertically and so the longer format is preferred there.",
    "So when you're getting ready to do your web comic, it's always good to kind of think about the places you're posting and let that inform your layout a little bit.",
    "If you're making these for traditional.",
    "Thomas printing production, that's another.",
    "That's a different thing.",
    "You've got different options there.",
    "You've got two page spreads that you can play around with, and you know there's a lot of really interesting stuff that's done with those those layouts, and it's a little different in mobile work, so.",
    "Hold on just a second.",
    "I'm noticing some dropped frames.",
    "If you guys see are having trouble with this stream, just let me know.",
    "'cause I.",
    "I've been noticing some problems with my router lately and it's really frustrating.",
    "I can't seem to have a stable stream.",
    "See I'm getting 14 down an now it's stable.",
    "Now what's going on with my connection here?",
    "I guess I'll keep that.",
    "Open and if I need too I will.",
    "Hey Larry, how are you doing today?",
    "Just a second I'm going to be are be an closed Dorcas Tuxi busted in.",
    "So he's like rude.",
    "All right?",
    "Alright, we back.",
    "And my.",
    "My video lives in the background dropped so.",
    "Make sure that that's OK.",
    "I want to approve comment.",
    "I'm not sure why.",
    "It doesn't like.",
    "There we go.",
    "Alright, so.",
    "Let's get to work.",
    "My typical Message here is I have a very messy sketch.",
    "She can see its litter literally just a mess.",
    "And.",
    "I grew up my sections.",
    "And then I drop them down into transparent.",
    "Only move this over here and I need to drop this down to about 30%.",
    "And then I'm gonna create my second layer where I put my liner in my color.",
    "Sorry.",
    "Let's go.",
    "Alright, so I imagine my little lady bug.",
    "I haven't really had this layout switched.",
    "I had it leading with coconut, but I think I want.",
    "I like the UM, this directionality better because if I had coconut over here I would have to.",
    "Have my ladybug kind of jumping against the grain up.",
    "She would.",
    "All of these panels would be reversed and I didn't think it really.",
    "Felt right 'cause the way you really coming this direction and to have my character you see this and then she's jumping this way.",
    "It just didn't seem as natural to me.",
    "This way.",
    "It kind of flows better between the frames to have her seeing this noticing something that's over here.",
    "It's continuous so she jumps and lands an it just.",
    "I don't know it, kind of.",
    "I'm sure that I could probably have made the original work, but.",
    "Haley's how are you welcome?",
    "If you have any questions, just let me know.",
    "I am just going over a little bit of my thinking as I started comics and I was talking about layout and how I originally had these two portions switched and so the action was kind of going against the direction of reading and so that just that felt really weird to me.",
    "So I had to switch that up and kind of reverse the entire thing when I was in the layout stage, which I did before I started stream.",
    "I kind of like to start stream with this stage intact and so let me show you an example.",
    "Let's go to where's my last web comic office one?",
    "This one will work.",
    "So this is shows the kind of final stage of a chronic for me.",
    "You can see here is my initial sketch that I will eventually move out of my artboard an I'll just have the line art in color here, but this is how it starts out.",
    "Very loose and then I come over and I line everything and then I am apply the color and final text.",
    "If there's any and then of course my website at the bottom and then I also talked about how I cut things up for Instagram because Instagram.",
    "Is really a great platform for comics.",
    "Right now I have a lot of comic creator friends on there.",
    "That just.",
    "I mean, it's crazy how much reach you have of comments right now.",
    "And of course you know Instagram can shut that down any day and you know, but it's just right now.",
    "A lot of people are looking for that on Instagram.",
    "And of course they're looking for it as well.",
    "On places like Webtoons and top this.",
    "But you know, always as.",
    "I think one of those places I read recently has a very very sticky.",
    "Wow, it is a little paragraph in their terms of service.",
    "That kind of limits what you can do with the comic.",
    "I think that allows them first publication rights or allows them to decline or something.",
    "I read that and I was like oh and yeah, so always read terms and conditions, but this is the how I break up this vertical comic for viewing on Instagram.",
    "So I've got my continuous panels here that will swipe seamlessly and then I have this separate ones which are their own frames.",
    "And then of course I've got this last one, which is another seamless swipe comic.",
    "So sweet, seamless swipe.",
    "Orientation and then finally I usually reserve unless the comic is too long I need all of those 10 swipe panels.",
    "I usually reserve the last for a little informational panel if I want to plug something in it or tell people you know if you want to get the book.",
    "Here's where you can get it.",
    "Or if you want to read more, you can see them on their website.",
    "If you don't want to scroll through all the Instagram posts 'cause I do post daily paintings as well.",
    "Thank you Chris.",
    "How's the?",
    "How's the PC setup going?",
    "So that's where this right here?",
    "This big messy panel is going to end up eventually.",
    "And I was also showing this is the cover for volume to that I'm going to be printing up very soon since I have the cover file done.",
    "All I need to do is create the actual book file in in design and I've got.",
    "I've got a little bit of an easier path than I did last year.",
    "Last year I was creating the book file from scratch, but since I have the book file created already, all I'm gonna do is lay in the new content.",
    "I'm gonna keep the the basic structure of it.",
    "All of my margin settings my my back section with the character descriptions.",
    "All of that good stuff is staying the same an all I'm going to do is rip out the old content and drop in new comics an I have about close to the volume that I had last year so I'm pretty pretty stoked.",
    "Well, hopefully they're all working fine now.",
    "That was just crazy to look at.",
    "I'm glad you like Italy's.",
    "It's it's very fun and relaxing for me to draw, so I like sharing it and I love sharing these little characters in their dentures though.",
    "It's evolved overtime and you know, even between this book and this one.",
    "how I draw this this character right here has changed quite a bit.",
    "And I kind of settled into a permanent way of drawing for like a lot of my characters that have involved in the way I draw them some.",
    "Some have stayed pretty much the same like happy paper.",
    "I mean how, how differently chemdraw roll toilet paper, but the cats all has kind of gone through their own evolutions, especially evil landlord.",
    "She has, she's changed quite a bit.",
    "And purchased kind of developed more as well.",
    "He's become more squishy, an more expressive.",
    "I'm trying to find me the landlord here.",
    "Oh, I have a couple of evil English comics here.",
    "And I can tell just looking at coconut and.",
    "That was an earlier comic that spudsy there's an earlier version of coconut right there.",
    "Now this is a very early version of her.",
    "This is about a year ago actually.",
    "Maybe a little more than a year.",
    "Kitten University is fairly.",
    "Early 19 I think.",
    "And I think the boiling of the first ones.",
    "Yeah, this is one of the first comic sided with coconut tips for raising the kitten.",
    "Now you can really see it in this one.",
    "You can see how that character has evolved.",
    "Her head was a lot more square I guess.",
    "Gosh, she really does look different.",
    "And now her head is more triangular.",
    "But but yeah, so she's changed quite a bit.",
    "And you can really see that here.",
    "We've got more angles here and more of a triangular shape as opposed to the square shape she was before, and I think I ended up.",
    "Um?",
    "I ended up changing her out in the yet see I had originally drawn.",
    "This is the character section in the back.",
    "I had originally drawn her kind of matching to these others and I came in back and looked at it when I was setting up the print files and then when she doesn't look like that anymore at all and so I changed her to the to this little excited coconut and I'm glad I did because it's a little bit.",
    "More in keeping with, you know where the character is now, but.",
    "You know, that's one of the first things I noticed, like when I was growing up.",
    "I would read the Garfield Comics and they would come in these long I think you can still get them, but they are about like this.",
    "There are long and thin and there would be about like to strip lines per page and I notice that Garfield evolved through those and it was just really interesting to look at.",
    "'cause If you look at very, very early Garfield cartoons.",
    "I mean, he's like he shaped like like this.",
    "I mean then there's his head.",
    "I mean, he's just ridiculous how how he changed in shape more in keeping with like a loaf cat as opposed to the more agile look that Garfield has today.",
    "And you can see that a little bit.",
    "I mean, you can see that in the peanuts cartoons a little bit to the earlier peanuts you can see a little bit of a difference, especially in Snoopy's proportions.",
    "And then it kind of, you know, as it goes through the years, you can kind of see where he settled.",
    "Uhm, I always loved looking at that and noticing that I thought it was really neat and.",
    "I'm trying to think of who else I've noticed that with.",
    "I want to say Calvin and Hobbes, but honestly I don't.",
    "I think he stayed pretty.",
    "He stayed pretty consistent throughout, but then again I haven't looked at that big omnibus collection that has everything in it to actually see I just have the books that I have.",
    "How much are?",
    "At three of AM 4 pounds, actually 4.",
    "And sensible.",
    "Oh, they sorted and homicidal jungle cat.",
    "And the days are just act.",
    "I have 4 collections of those.",
    "Anyway.",
    "Let me get to drawing finally.",
    "Right, so I'm going to start with my plan for my little lady bug is hiding.",
    "And actually, let's go ahead and flesh out this environment a little bit more.",
    "I'm going to draw on my base.",
    "My dear, I don't wanna do that way.",
    "And this is going to be a big pot, so like.",
    "Hello.",
    "An account down here and just draw the edge.",
    "I do a lot of shortcuts like this to keep my shapes consistent.",
    "My son drawing pots and vases and stuff like that.",
    "I'll just duplicate the edge and reflect it.",
    "And then I'll come in here and drop.",
    "Sections out if I need too.",
    "She said This is gonna be I need to have kind of a plant like a fraud here.",
    "Yeah, my character is going to sit.",
    "And the shape of this plant needs to make sense with that.",
    "So let me just go ahead and kind of.",
    "Let me just go ahead and figure some things out here so.",
    "I'm thinking about, you know there are.",
    "Do you have any tips for starting a comic view?",
    "OK, uhm.",
    "I guess the biggest tip I would give is to start and that that's a loaded one, because I mean.",
    "You know, depending on the type of comic that you're doing up, there needs to be a lot of planning.",
    "A lot of writing.",
    "If it's a longform comic where you know you're looking at like a graphic novel, that's going to be several 100 pages you know just starting.",
    "Maybe maybe the writing process and getting the writing done and doing that and.",
    "Just starting maybe a shorter form comic like mine under one, pagers and.",
    "That it may be the hurdle to start is just actually drawing the first one and getting it out there.",
    "And because the important thing I think, at least for me, was getting that start in and committing to a schedule.",
    "I started and stopped a lot.",
    "I've actually started drawing comics in around 2010, an not on any schedule an it just took me forever to make one an I was always blocked.",
    "I always dreaded doing it because my skills weren't up to that.",
    "The level where I wanted them to be, yet where I could come from out on a reliable basis so.",
    "I kind of started and stopped for a long time and then I started my daily paintings which helped me get my skills.",
    "You know a little bit higher so I felt more comfortable committing to a schedule an instead of saying, OK, I'm going to.",
    "I'm going to do 3 comics a week.",
    "I'm going to do Monday, Wednesday, Friday.",
    "I started with just once a week 'cause I knew from my previous experience that you know that once a week I need to get used to that.",
    "I need to get comfortable with that.",
    "And then once I'm comfortable with that.",
    "I can push out of my comfort zone again in at 2:00 and then once I'm comfortable in, you know, have a habit of scheduling things and making the time to make those two comics.",
    "I can push out again and work my way up to the ultimate posting schedule that I want, so I mean.",
    "The first thing I would do I mean, you know I say just start, but I mean.",
    "I think you would have a better chance of success the more that you help yourself, so if helping yourself means planning out writing, reading books about making comics, idea, you know, finding the areas where you're not.",
    "We're not really comfortable like, for example, one of the areas that I was really struggling with was going frame to frame.",
    "What actions can I draw from one frame to another that are easily connected, easily understandable, and that's something that I honestly I read a lot about, but I didn't really get until I had started drawing and still until I kind of knew through experience in actually doing it.",
    "You know what can I get away with?",
    "What can?",
    "What still reads right?",
    "What is understandable?",
    "And what have I gone too far and not left enough sore left too much to the imagination so it's.",
    "It's kind of a a process of finding things that you know, giving yourself the best chance of continuing it and getting it done so.",
    "No, maybe.",
    "I know that so Grambling very rambling answer to the question, but I hope some of that has helped.",
    "And if you have any specific things that I mentioned there that you want me to elaborate on, just let me know.",
    "But as far as reading goes, I can.",
    "It's always good to research, so I've got several.",
    "These guys I think, are indispensable if you're making comics, understanding comics and making comics, I'd start here.",
    "This is where I started, and this this is a little bit more brainy.",
    "It kind of goes into discussions of symbols and history, an.",
    "Some things that you may not be interested until you you know dive deeper into this.",
    "This is a deep dive.",
    "This is basically nothing.",
    "Books right here.",
    "So what he did I believe this is the first one.",
    "This was a 94 I think.",
    "Just imagine.",
    "I can't remember actually know this is number 2, so this is the first one that he published in 94.",
    "Uhm, but what I particularly like about this one is that it is done in a graphic novel comic format, so it immerses you in what you want to learn about an.",
    "You learn through comics.",
    "You learn about comics through comics, so a lot of writers suggest if you want to write a book, you need to read a lot and you need to read in the genre that you want to publish in.",
    "Same thing with comics.",
    "If you want to make comics, you need to read comics.",
    "You need to immerse yourself in that world, whether it's Web Comics, whether it's graphic novels, whether it's traditional Marvel DC, and that you know area.",
    "And that's actually something that I've noticed is very.",
    "I think it's strange because like if you walk into Barnes and Noble, you can't find one spot with comics.",
    "You've got some comics in the kids section you've got that don't belong in the kids section by the way.",
    "They have got some in the team section.",
    "Then you got some like sitting over by science fiction in the manga an it's not 1 one single place where they put everything.",
    "It's weird, but.",
    "But you can kind of, you know, walk through and see.",
    "You know, I like these styles.",
    "I liked the manga style, so I'm going to research and read a lot of manga to get into that at mode.",
    "But yeah, I would definitely suggest this.",
    "If you're thinking about starting in comic, this is Scott McCloud.",
    "And he has.",
    "Actually, I think it's for now.",
    "He's got understanding, making an reinventing comics, and I think there's a 4th one in there somewhere, but I just have those three.",
    "I know the tip of using pencil tool for filling shape.",
    "After watching your stream very first time.",
    "Oh you're welcome, wroxeter.",
    "Love plans should I think they don't like me except for chili and mint?",
    "No, the only plants that I can not well.",
    "I've only succeeded in keeping succulents alive personally.",
    "So I tried basil plants.",
    "I tried actually planting some sunflowers and Cineos from seeds and coconut.",
    "Ended up eating them and I think the rest of them just died.",
    "Yeah, 'cause I stop watering them 'cause I had given up.",
    "So it you know.",
    "Gotta have a green thumb but you don't I guess, and I don't really have a green thumb.",
    "You're welcome, Elise.",
    "I hope those help.",
    "I know it was a little bit rambling, but I mean there's a lot and you know really just starting it.",
    "Just taking that idea and doing something with it is going to be your best thing that you can do because I mean.",
    "You've got to get out of the comfort zone.",
    "You gotta start taking action and you know you can think about an, you know, say I want to do a kind of grow I I should really do something with this story.",
    "You can do that forever, but it's not going to come into being until you actually start taking action.",
    "So I think the best tip is to outline what those actions can be that you can start to make it real.",
    "And so I have like a lot of ideas and things that I haven't fleshed out into scripts yet.",
    "And you know, they're not going to happen until I actually sit down and do it.",
    "And no matter how uncomfortable it is or how how much you feel that I don't know what I'm doing.",
    "You know, no, no one knows what they're doing, you know, especially in our, everybody starts out at zero and everybody has to learn through doing so.",
    "Just starting is really probably the best tip I can give.",
    "And you know everything else is just a matter of looking it up and learning and reading an figuring out yourself.",
    "Figuring out the story, going to tell, and figuring out what is meaningful to you that you think you put it out there can be meaningful, unhelpful someone else.",
    "I see that you're one of the people still got within my books with her personality.",
    "Yeah, I've got a little book problem that's one shelf of 1234.",
    "So yeah, I thought.",
    "I'm going to leave it.",
    "And to read a lot of different things too.",
    "You're welcome, you're feeling.",
    "I guess another good tip would be to just be nice to yourself.",
    "'cause like how I started out with saying.",
    "You know I'm going to do.",
    "You know three Postal ebook.",
    "Be realistic, be kind to yourself.",
    "You're starting out from zero.",
    "You've never drawn a comic before.",
    "It's not realistic to go for, you know.",
    "Three days a week or or post every day you're going to burn yourself out, so be nice to yourself.",
    "Be kind to yourself.",
    "Set realistic goals that challenge your challenge.",
    "You but not burn you out an his like with my with my paintings.",
    "I set myself limits like look I you know I have to draw at least 30 minutes a day an I can if I do that, I can call that a daily, but you know more often than not I'm drawing, you know, maybe an hour or more and or maybe 3 hours.",
    "Or you know I'm counting maybe 1 frame of a comic as my daily an.",
    "But that allows me to have those days where I'm really tired.",
    "I'm not feeling like it.",
    "It allows me to.",
    "Go easy on myself and I think that's very important when you're attacking any goal where you want to learn something new.",
    "When you want to, you know, improve your art skills or comics goes your writing skills.",
    "You've got to be realistic, because if you're not.",
    "In tune with what you can do.",
    "You don't know.",
    "But is going to be.",
    "A challenge enough an what is too much you know, because if you're.",
    "If you're so overwhelmed by what you set yourself out to do that you don't do anything and you accomplish nothing you you know you challenge yourself and then decided that Nope, it's not going to work, so your net is 0 but if you know it's kind of like if you're trying to get in an exercise habit is better to do one pushup than none.",
    "I mean, yeah, it's one push up, but it's reinforcing the habit that you want to build.",
    "I'm illustrator in my country too nice.",
    "I've talked a lot and not drawn a lot so.",
    "Let me come.",
    "Let me do some drawing here.",
    "So I got my little character here.",
    "What are some details here?",
    "My character is gonna be here.",
    "So I need her to be visible.",
    "So what I'm doing right now as I'm just kind of drawing her outline's so I can keep in mind this is where she's going to be and I need to keep this visible.",
    "I need to keep you know.",
    "This area mostly.",
    "Devoted to her so.",
    "I don't want this part to be like.",
    "Earthenware type.",
    "Take off.",
    "It's just getting really warm.",
    "Much better.",
    "You know I'm gonna leave that in there for now and I'm going to just draw a group.",
    "Of My Little Lady by character.",
    "And she needs to be.",
    "She kind of just shown here, so I'm gonna put her little very little digits like this.",
    "So you're going to see there, and then I have a face like this.",
    "She needs to notice coconut.",
    "So this is her little.",
    "Kind of cut between him.",
    "Where her wings come together on her back.",
    "So she's going to change a little bit from when I drew when I originally drew heard.",
    "'cause I do believe that was a healthy, healthy while ago, um.",
    "So.",
    "I gave her a little antenna, OK?",
    "OK, so.",
    "She needs to have her intent.",
    "And See for things like this.",
    "I'm glad I kept the leaf in the background because if I had race that already I'd have to redraw it.",
    "So that's part of my working process.",
    "I only usually draw much more than I really need.",
    "In all races at the end, once I determine where certain elements are going to be and what I want to use, what I don't want to use.",
    "Alright, so now that I know where she's going to be, we go here.",
    "First of all, an group this entire section.",
    "Settled in my outline behind it even more.",
    "Right so and then I want to grab these two lines because I'm ready to erase.",
    "I'm pretty happy with where she's sitting here.",
    "So now I'm thinking about the environment.",
    "Not hurt here.",
    "I've got coconut, which I'm going to start drawing in just a second.",
    "But I want to flush out the scene a little bit more and.",
    "Kind of think about what's going to be on the walls.",
    "Is there going to be like a picture frame?",
    "For example?",
    "Kind of hanging out over here?",
    "Am I gonna have another one over here?",
    "am I going to have like?",
    "Maybe the edge of a table over here like she's standing in um we just kind of sketch that out.",
    "She's got a table here.",
    "Just kind of figure out where that's going to be.",
    "Something like that.",
    "And in this thing I can kind of draw on things that I've done in the past 'cause.",
    "I had a couple of end tables like this in previous comics.",
    "Now this is just a rough sketch I'll go through and actually make it decent.",
    "Something like this, and maybe if I have this here maybe?",
    "Maybe I'll move this up a little bit.",
    "So 'cause I want coconut kinda here.",
    "I think these edges are focusing.",
    "On this area where she's going to stand, these little frogs are pointing their.",
    "My little character is looking at her, so this is all in support of this theme subject.",
    "And then maybe I'll do, maybe I can do a smaller plant here.",
    "Maybe something that.",
    "I really like that shape.",
    "Someone keep it.",
    "Bring you down here and maybe I'll have like some sort of a succulent in here like that.",
    "And maybe I can have like another one over here.",
    "Just to fill in this area.",
    "It will make it more believable.",
    "And something that I personally do when I'm drawing comics, especially in illustrators.",
    "I'll go outside of my art board a little bit.",
    "And that's because mostly because when I'm cutting things up for Instagram, this panel needs to be a little bit bigger if I want to fit a lot of stuff in it, I usually have to blow it up and there's a portion of it will.",
    "She can kinda see it here this whole panel.",
    "On Instagram has a lot more dropped out of it than just name one does, so I only got about half of my little grassy fits over there.",
    "Same thing was here.",
    "I slide his body butter bothering me.",
    "Move it down a little bit.",
    "Seems like she's looking right here a little bit more too, so I'm gonna go ahead and cut here and cut here.",
    "4.",
    "All right, so the next thing I need to do is this little.",
    "And then click whatever but they.",
    "That's another thing else.",
    "I looked like references in furniture shops, and if you go online look like me to crate&barrel or you know any of these online stores that have you know West down they have all of these nice furniture settings.",
    "You know when they're selling your stuff and you can use those for reference.",
    "You can kind of look and get ideas of how nicely arranged living room with look like and how you can support your characters with different items.",
    "What's the style of your character?",
    "Are they more?",
    "Country rustic or is your character more like more modern stuff you know?",
    "Look up all that stuff.",
    "There's so many references available an All you have to do is just look at him and.",
    "And figure out, you know, take the pieces you like and leave what you don't.",
    "All right?",
    "Answer.",
    "Oftentimes I'll hold down the shift key when you're drawing with the blob brush it automatically.",
    "Draws at angles for you.",
    "It's a little finicky sometimes, but it'll help draw straight lines.",
    "Little bit easier, it's helpful, especially when you're drawing in perspective.",
    "Just a little shortcut.",
    "Anything to save?",
    "My little brain power.",
    "Another thing will often do is kind of.",
    "How to duplicate some of these and using that way?",
    "There we go hey instant end table.",
    "Mr saddiq dear.",
    "Where is it?",
    "Oh yeah, and now shift key again, making my drawers super easy except when it decides not to draw at the angle I wanted to draw it.",
    "Then let's duplicate this.",
    "So I've got two drawers of the same size.",
    "That's another good trick that I use so often.",
    "If you have an item you want to duplicate and you don't want to do copy and paste and just have your direct selection tool, you select the item first of all and see how that it might might be.",
    "Now you can see it.",
    "See how my cursor is switching to a double.",
    "That's because I'm holding down the alt key.",
    "And what happens when you hold down and out key pick up and drag something?",
    "It creates a copy and I use that quite a bit.",
    "Another good trick for this is when you copy and let's say you do this.",
    "Like that and you want a huge line, you hit control V and it'll duplicate in line.",
    "Just repeat what you did some easy way to create patterns.",
    "And if you want to be Super Fancy can till then I think how do you do that?",
    "How do I do the tilde thing?",
    "Said this.",
    "There's something that's Super Fancy at all.",
    "That's what it is, is this.",
    "Ah.",
    "Yeah, that was fun.",
    "OK, so if you want to create like geometric art.",
    "An and take your shape tool and hold down the tilde.",
    "I'm going to start drawing and you can do all sorts of cool things.",
    "And now all of those shapes are selected if I default.",
    "Which is a white cell and a a black stroke.",
    "You get your shape here.",
    "And then if I don't want to have this mess like this.",
    "And let's undo.",
    "There we go.",
    "I just switched that and you can get the you got the necessary.",
    "Fun stuff.",
    "I don't really use that one that often, but it's sometimes fun to do.",
    "You can do it.",
    "It's kind of cool.",
    "For star tool, you kind of go up here can spin it.",
    "We got this cool patterns.",
    "But again, I don't know is is that all that often?",
    "We just got reminded with the ad duplication tool.",
    "All right, and I do need a whole on my drawer.",
    "And I'm gonna just make it simple.",
    "No need to make it more complicated than it should be.",
    "I want to put something on this table.",
    "Maybe I'll put like a base.",
    "And again I like to keep my lease is symmetrical, So what I'll do is I'll draw one side and then I'll reflect it.",
    "Match it up and then draw the bottom.",
    "This of course.",
    "And I can just connect this bottom.",
    "Man, I have a base.",
    "Move everything.",
    "There we go.",
    "And see what type of Flowers do I want to happen here?",
    "Let's do.",
    "Let's do some really kind of.",
    "Some little grass is here, maybe I do.",
    "So this is a.",
    "Hey trick I used to draw Flowers and this is just to kind of get in mind the directionality of where I want them to be.",
    "So I want this one opening towards the viewer.",
    "This one is opening up and this one is opening up that way, so it's just a way for me to keep in mind where I want this to go.",
    "And then I'm going to have like something over here that's more of like with grass.",
    "And I'm going to draw.",
    "Let's go ahead and fill in the Flowers.",
    "Then I can do this stems.",
    "And so this a space in a little more.",
    "So I'm going to take these guys.",
    "I'm going to group them and I'm going to drop them down.",
    "Thanks, Mary Sue.",
    "Alright, so last thing I want to do and here is maybe just draw these screens out.",
    "Doesn't need to be super.",
    "Super Duper perfect.",
    "Just enough.",
    "All right, so that is done.",
    "All right, so let's go here and move this guideline out.",
    "And there's my first frame done.",
    "Those lines in the leaves not too thin.",
    "Oh, you know what?",
    "Yeah, it'll appear.",
    "I think it'll be OK.",
    "I mean, it all depends on how I laid out.",
    "This is if it's an 8 1/2 by 11, it'll definitely it appear, it'll appear, but if I try to print in like a four by six is going to be much.",
    "But you know 11 by 17.",
    "That would be fine and this.",
    "This is 6 1/2 by 8 an you know.",
    "I was surprised with the amount of detail that came out.",
    "Let me see one of the more elaborate.",
    "Comics.",
    "Not walk with me.",
    "One had a lot of detail in the background.",
    "It still showed up.",
    "Let me see, could I have several ones that are really super detailed?",
    "May have a lot of tiny Flowers in the background of this one.",
    "And they all showed up pretty well.",
    "Could have gotten more detailed as I've gone along.",
    "Trying to remember what hours drawing at super tiny that that that bass right here.",
    "What has a lot of detail inside of it that showed up pretty well?",
    "And I would say it's a little bit bigger.",
    "Some of my other, more detailed comics I think I've just really leaned into the detail recently.",
    "Meanest coconuts.",
    "The collection box has a lot of detail on it.",
    "And it showed up pretty well.",
    "So yeah, I mean.",
    "Not too shabby.",
    "As another, it's a basket, a bunch of fruit in it.",
    "All right, so next what I'm going to do is I'm going to drop these panels down.",
    "And for speed with those.",
    "These will be easy.",
    "I do.",
    "I need to move that I need to do the frame.",
    "What should be the same for each of them solve, duplicate that over and then he's actually should go pretty quickly as well as the rest of the comic.",
    "Just these areas with the detail that.",
    "He gets out down in Everett.",
    "Be back.",
    "Right side back to normal way off.",
    "Though.",
    "So I'm doing my shift key trick again.",
    "Sometimes you have to run up and down the line because sometimes it'll start out ultra thin and be really wonky.",
    "So that's just, you know how my.",
    "In my experience, how it how it behaved could be something to do with my set up in my settings.",
    "And this is my quick frame.",
    "And I think that.",
    "And I use that trick that I mentioned before holding down the alt key, clicking and dragging, and then since I have this I just hit control V and I have another equidistant replication.",
    "Very little legs.",
    "She doesn't have much in the way of legs.",
    "Alright, I gonna say the lines for this are done so in a hit she.",
    "Need to add my little and I'm going to do a small like a shadow beneath are right there.",
    "Skype my regular font.",
    "So.",
    "They had careful little fist bump.",
    "Sexy.",
    "Meaning.",
    "Very bad, alright?",
    "So let's save.",
    "And now is the time for coloring.",
    "So we get that going here.",
    "This will probably color Super Duper fast with that.",
    "Um, how right?",
    "Let's do it.",
    "So we here.",
    "I thought I heard a notification sound.",
    "Select everything.",
    "Kinda like her color of her orange cat and her tail.",
    "I like it to be a little bit on the desaturated.",
    "Not quite that with something more like this.",
    "Listen, you always have something to tell us all.",
    "I think you actually.",
    "I don't know.",
    "I think it's something.",
    "Sometimes it's you know I'm drawing the things that I want to hear.",
    "If I'm feeling overwhelmed or something like that and I don't know it kind of it's organic making comics.",
    "At least the way I do it.",
    "Oh, I need to make my colors so I've got green plants.",
    "I've got the room decoration, so that's a wooden end table, so I need to have sort of earthy tones.",
    "Um, let's get some Blues in there an I like to offset some of those colors.",
    "I have pretty Flowers so I need some flower colors.",
    "Let's just think about that.",
    "I need Coco's little tail color, which is right there?",
    "Let me think about wings.",
    "Greens and.",
    "Natural colors.",
    "'cause I have a lot of things in there.",
    "Oh, and I need her red.",
    "That's her lady bug red.",
    "Marvin orange orangey red.",
    "Let's see.",
    "That's really all I need.",
    "Her body color will be kind of like a brownish, so let me take this color.",
    "Some variance in there?",
    "So if you want to know what I've been doing, I've been building up Swatch pallets right here.",
    "And I do that by coming up here to the color guide, and I kind of pick around and I'll come in later.",
    "And actually, I'll do that now.",
    "I always have this set to Hue, saturation, and balance so I can edit the colours as I'm going along, especially if I'm doing something like this where I want to Desaturate some of the colors that are in the background.",
    "I'll do that to my line art to kind of give it that feeling if it's further away and I'll I'll push like the Hue probably towards purple or blue.",
    "And you know, just kind of change things up that way, but as far as a base goes, actually this is A is a good example to.",
    "You can see that right here.",
    "I've built a quite an extensive pallet here and you can kind of see if you look.",
    "If you look at the final illustration, you know where everything played out.",
    "I've got, you know, oranges on coconut.",
    "I've got Browns on my pug in my moma cheat.",
    "I've got some Blues and greens unhappy pluses, white body.",
    "I've got the foods are a little bit of a off white egg shell color samu he's color bread and he's got his blue jeans on.",
    "And then I've got these.",
    "You know all these greens back here that I've gone through and you can kind of see that reflected in my palette there.",
    "Um?",
    "I do that is kind of like a springboard.",
    "I don't just sit on these, but I like to have the colours there in case I want to just go back and pick something.",
    "It'll keep them consistent.",
    "Also, if I figure out like oftentimes all, edit her body color up a little bit from an original Swatch, and then I'll just add that back to my Swatch is.",
    "So I have that, and I'm not picking.",
    "Different colors each time of keeping everything consistent.",
    "And so that's kind of the same with her cap color.",
    "She's got, you know, an orange cap, and I'll have you know something like this color will be not that color.",
    "It, like maybe this a little bit brighter will be here.",
    "Orange cap color and I'll make sure that I know where that is in my palette so I can keep going back to it and not having my character be, you know, rainbow of different colors when she should.",
    "She has an orange cap, she has a white body you know, and Brown and orange stripes.",
    "It just keeps things on.",
    "You know, together for me, same thing with my lady bug.",
    "She'll have a darker face color and then she'll have her Brown body and then she'll have the red on her.",
    "Her little wing back.",
    "And Oh, I forgot to cover those on.",
    "Let me go ahead and do that.",
    "And again, the tool I'm using to do this is the pencil tool.",
    "I like to use that to color.",
    "Spells in large areas of coloring.",
    "Then I'll come back over here.",
    "Other things alright, so let's start.",
    "Let's dive in this first hit save and now I'm going to go into this first section.",
    "And I'm going to start at the left with my lady bug.",
    "And her little green plant here so.",
    "I want to have some nice kind of blueish Green's in here, so I'm going to come over here.",
    "That's maybe 2 blue.",
    "I'm gonna push this guy little bit more towards green.",
    "Add that color set in here.",
    "And what I do to start is I make my shapes.",
    "And I'll usually come back in and edit and I didn't make that shape load.",
    "Also, let's start again.",
    "Here we go.",
    "Now we're cooking with gas.",
    "These are just kind of like I'm putting in my flat colors.",
    "Michael here a lot of artists talk about putting in the slaps.",
    "That's what this is.",
    "I'm just kind of thinking about my colors making general shapes.",
    "And so in many areas, and then I'm going to just go ahead and draw through Earths.",
    "I know she's going to be here in the separate Somerset and I'll send that to the back and I'll kind of mess around with these in a range of before I put any gradients in or shading 'cause I know inside in the interior of the planet is going to be.",
    "It's going to be like dark under here because light isn't reaching there as easily as it is.",
    "Kind of like up here at the top of the front and here where let's say for example my light sources right here and shining down like that.",
    "So this area is going to explode.",
    "This area it was this area is going to get hit hit this area.",
    "I mean it's underneath.",
    "This leaf is kind of folded over so it's going to be darker.",
    "These areas are going to be darker.",
    "That's definitely going to be darker, so I just start thinking about that a little bit as I'm making these and kind of setting my plan.",
    "Setting my clean up.",
    "I want this to be like an earthenware kind of clay pot.",
    "So the big old clay pot.",
    "So let's go over here and let's get kind of like A.",
    "Play color.",
    "Does that make it look nice?",
    "And her back is going to.",
    "I forgot to color in her little back bit as well.",
    "Going my group here.",
    "And that is going to be problematic 'cause it's over her little footers.",
    "Maybe not so problematic.",
    "Just do something like that and then I'll come in here and drop her little bat coloring to brighter day.",
    "I think that would play nicely, theoretically, would will see though, 'cause I can always come in and switch it up, and I'm going to give her a little bit of a darker face.",
    "That Then come back out here.",
    "Let's fighting this up a little bit, maybe something more.",
    "Is her body is going to be?",
    "Yeah.",
    "Well, the face of a lady by this time so.",
    "Go back to that previous color.",
    "But that way you can still see her her expressions.",
    "Alright, so let's come over here and put my I wanted to make this.",
    "Come in here and color.",
    "This time I'm going to do a couple of different greens in here, maybe even some yellows like me get this little I like this little pallet here.",
    "And I'm just going to pick a few of these.",
    "This woman.",
    "I still haven't balanced with the different colors and picking.",
    "After that, and then I'll come in and let's do a little bit of a greeting.",
    "Even like that, maybe I'll just pick.",
    "Maybe I'll do a darker green can see now it's the same colors that guy.",
    "Hum.",
    "Nice little little bit of variance there.",
    "Yeah, coming here and drop some kind of these other guys.",
    "So.",
    "And maybe our even notices on this canvas.",
    "It may be on a different campus, so I'm going to go ahead and call this in like for Instagram for example.",
    "I might have, uh, these boots are showing.",
    "It was part of the maybe more obviously hopes cancel.",
    "Here we go.",
    "And then I'm just going to extend this over here little bit.",
    "And, uh, well, I want let's do like a Gray hot baby.",
    "And I'm going to come here and I'm going to dark in this color a little bit and add it to my my palette up here.",
    "Come on, let's just do some blue stripes like this.",
    "I have a friend.",
    "She.",
    "So.",
    "Cancel.",
    "So let's do something pretty in bright.",
    "He be able.",
    "Blue, Green All right, and this is something I think it's gonna be a nice healthy green.",
    "Then again, I'll probably hit this with the gradient, but I just wanted kids the idea.",
    "Colour shape anyway.",
    "It's still.",
    "Cancel.",
    "2 minutes.",
    "Dynamite reappear and save.",
    "'cause you always want to.",
    "All right now it's time to color Miss Cocoa Bean.",
    "Chica for cat color.",
    "And I decided on this color scheme for her, because I mean if you look at the real cat, she's got a lot of bright, bright orange kind of almost rusty orange in some spots, lots of spots with an.",
    "If you if you turn on.",
    "Unfocused for sun focus your eyes.",
    "The average of the color.",
    "She has a more orange cap than she has any other color.",
    "So I went ahead and simplified it and made her made her just a little bit of white mouth.",
    "'cause That's what she's got.",
    "She's kind of got a mask on or cap as I call it, so it goes like this and around the back of her head.",
    "Nothing to her ears.",
    "Her ears are pretty bright orange and.",
    "And that's how I decided on her colors.",
    "I know I wanted something.",
    "You know, really, to make her looking meat from the other cat.",
    "So I did her stripes differently.",
    "Taxi just has like a regular 123 stripe on his tail.",
    "Mobile cheat has the heart tail evil.",
    "Landlord has hers is a tail with a dollar sign on it and cat cat has just a really fluffy bushy tail because that's what the real cat had.",
    "She was a medium long hair black cat.",
    "So I try to keep, you know, my inspirations for the characters true to life, where I could.",
    "Coconut she has to shoulder stocks to in real life.",
    "There orange and Brown but for consistency sake and so I wasn't always switching them up.",
    "I made them the same color.",
    "Since I'm drawing her so often, I want to make sure I could keep her design consistent.",
    "And if I'm always having to think OK, is that the right side or the left side that was orange versus Brown?",
    "That would have gotten old pretty quick.",
    "Is that something you can think about two when you're doing character designs for your comics?",
    "Think about draw ability in the long run, because you're going to be drawing these characters over and over and over again, and all manner of different positions.",
    "So you want to make it relatively easy on yourself to turn these characters around to manipulate them in space and place them in different situations.",
    "You don't want to have such a crazy, crazy, awesome really.",
    "Detailed costing designs are great, but when you're drawing that.",
    "Over and over and over again.",
    "It gets a little bit.",
    "You know you start wondering why you did it to yourself.",
    "Right and got her colored up and let me do this side table with the base and I think I have this in a Yes I do.",
    "Coming with something else on the side table with right here.",
    "Maybe there's a book?",
    "Strong and book real quick or something?",
    "Just chilling out here on the.",
    "Did I group this?",
    "I didn't fit.",
    "All right?",
    "Let's see here in US.",
    "Anything he answered stick box.",
    "This is like one piece or something here.",
    "I may be a Cherry Potter.",
    "Then Why not?",
    "Alright then I'm gonna grab a mistake.",
    "Green cover green.",
    "Look up now.",
    "I gotta book on the table.",
    "And let's make the Top Model different color.",
    "Wake up and now I need page colors.",
    "So.",
    "Coming here like so.",
    "Just got in there and boom, we've got a book on the table.",
    "Alright, so I mean.",
    "Help this along the shadow under here.",
    "There we go.",
    "So now it feels with bear.",
    "Feels more looking all right now I want to address some of the shadows are here.",
    "Sure, I know she's gonna be talking like that.",

    "Allen over each other.",
    "Light isn't gonna be.",
    "Reaching some parts is easily as others, so see this guy.",
    "He's underneath this other one.",
    "Who might have a little shadow falling on him?",
    "This guy he is being overlapped by this one so maybe his E is like this.",
    "So.",
    "Kind of thinking in levels, lights coming down from top.",
    "What's going to be blocked in it won't be this guy right here.",
    "He's got a lot of problems.",
    "He is being blocked by.",
    "Quite a bit.",
    "So why is my Princess?",
    "Kinda.",
    "Alright, so this guy back to the city guy right here he needs.",
    "Shadow Cancel.",
    "And My Little Lady said she can have some too.",
    "Yes girl.",
    "So let's draw little bit under here and he showed.",
    "Google.",
    "She's sitting on ready.",
    "Just kind of.",
    "I'm just trying to get that to be a little bit more.",
    "And now I've got that green.",
    "Let's go ahead and hit this with a gradient.",
    "And let's just see how this looks, so that's pretty.",
    "Uh, that's a little bit much.",
    "Alright, let's do it right this time.",
    "So let's just think about this logically.",
    "If this guy ESL, English succulents have really fleshy leads, and that's what I was thinking of when I was drawing this little guy.",
    "There really kind of like pillows.",
    "And so maybe the light isn't going to be hitting directly under this area.",
    "Maybe it's a little darker under here because they're kind of billowing out from this plant bowl.",
    "And then I have up here I can take input little touches like right where I think.",
    "You might need it just right there, just 12345.",
    "And then it's come over here.",
    "This guys going from shadow here.",
    "And since this plan is so big, he needs to cast a shadow on the wall.",
    "I think 'cause I've got that here, I've got.",
    "Let's join these guys together since they're going to.",
    "The car all kind of.",
    "Mash together here, so let's think about how this guy is going to.",
    "Environment with the lights coming from the top.",
    "Maybe I'll just have some shadow coming in right here.",
    "And.",
    "Wow.",
    "Send that to Fast forward very well, alright?",
    "Let's see, let's think about this guy here.",
    "'cause he's sitting on wall.",
    "And I'm gonna come in here and I'm going to draw.",
    "With that Kinda want to draw just something inside this picture frame.",
    "Not a group him.",

    "Little flower.",
    "Sing a flower action.",

    "How much?",
    "Z.",
    "And maybe I have.",
    "Internet search.",
    "Asking the default.",
    "Just selected this way, so I don't want this to be so bright.",
    "Hi.",
    "I don't want it to have so much attention drawn to it.",
    "And then maybe I'll come over the top here.",
    "And I want to sleep.",
    "Neighbors.",
    "So there's glass.",
    "Maybe just something, maybe this, this one over here.",
    "Is an abstract art piece.",
    "And I was at a microcosm.",
    "Don't know I wasn't.",
    "Just like this mess over here.",
    "Is it?",
    "Darn it.",
    "Merge only with selection, so if it's selected I can merge it and it'll be one shape after that.",
    "So that's a way I kind of fill in those little gaps that don't get closed.",
    "It's a good little trick.",
    "Alright, so let's see here, let's do.",
    "Uh, my show color 'cause she's still under the leaf right now, so.",
    "So I'm going to do that little push trick right here.",
    "I'm sister, sister Rackley.",
    "Under her body is not any model right now.",
    "In the dark, and enough a little bit there we go.",
    "You know not too bad.",

    "I'm gonna be there.",
    "White background there just to highlight, you know the exclamation point that she's got.",
    "She's notice something and she springing into action in the next one.",
    "So as you can see right here, my trick worked.",
    "I've got the frame cleaning up those edges and I have a nice clean final.",
    "Do you have a favorite color palette you've created me often use no.",
    "Uhm, I have a couple.",
    "I mean, I usually either do my line color in this Brown.",
    "Or like a darker blue ish tone.",
    "But other than that I don't really.",
    "I mean.",
    "I like a lot of greens and Blues like Seafoam and coral.",
    "Those are some of my favorite colors.",
    "And like Robins egg blue I kind of love those pallets and I tend towards them.",
    "But I tried to kind of push out of my comfort zone when I can and use different colors just so I can.",
    "Keep those mental muscles flexed.",
    "Hum.",
    "And it's not always that easy, you know, I mean.",
    "When you got colors you really enjoy working with.",
    "Say no, I'm not going to use those today and let you know, do this one.",
    "I don't use that often an 'cause there are there a few colors that I challenge myself to use that I just can't quite get the balance right yet?",
    "In as slowly figuring those out.",
    "But in general, I like to stay.",
    "Now I just can't say that 'cause I mean.",
    "There are certain colors that I come back to a lot, but there are.",
    "I like to use more for range from IKEA.",
    "Like the Jelly bunnies, I really love drawing down because they use every single color and it's a lot of fun too.",
    "You know, figure that out and we can work together.",
    "Sorry.",
    "Little.",
    "Lady boots spring into action here.",
    "I'm going to have her underwing just be a little bit more.",
    "Translucent.",
    "Want to do that?",
    "And then I explored my free set pallets over here.",
    "These are all based on harmony rules and so I was like OK, well I know I need a lot of oranges and Browns 'cause I've got plants.",
    "I've got this cat character.",
    "I have Brown furniture and round frames in this in this.",
    "In this, in this comic, so I'm trying to think along the lines of what I know I need to have colors for, and then I'll come down here and just.",
    "I'll kind of follow and walk along and pick a bunch of different palettes I like, and then I'll come in and say, OK, I don't have enough greens, so I'll pick this green color here.",
    "And that's what I did here.",
    "And so now you can see when you bring down this color guide menu, all of these different cream palettes.",
    "And so I pick a few of those.",
    "And then I follow the rabbit down another whole pick.",
    "A darker green.",
    "Come through 'cause I know I need some more desaturated darker greens in there too.",
    "I don't want to have them all toward orange.",
    "I want some of them more towards blue and that's what I kind of did here and then.",
    "I came back and I said OK.",
    "Well I got a lady bug in this in this comic as well.",
    "Lady bug is red so I need some Reds and that's where I went through here and then.",
    "So that's kind of how I think my way through it.",
    "And once I have these set up.",
    "I will come through and.",
    "For any one color, I'll I'll modify the Hue, saturation and balance.",
    "So for example, let me go over here.",
    "Actually, let me say first.",
    "Um?",
    "So let's take this guy for example.",
    "The items that are further away from the viewer, they're going to be.",
    "More desaturated, they're going to tend towards Blues and Purples, as those give the appearance of distance.",
    "Like if you're looking.",
    "If you're standing in a park or looking out towards the mountains, that things are really, really far in the distance.",
    "Have an appearance of kind of like Purple Blues.",
    "It just kind of tends that way, so I'm going to take my green color, for example here, and I'm going to push it a little bit.",
    "I'm gonna push the Hue a little bit towards the Purples in the Blues.",
    "And I'm going to drop these colors down and desaturate them a bit, which is right over here because as things get further away, they become less less distinct.",
    "They become more desaturated and that creates depth in the painting.",
    "If you notice up here, I've got more saturated greens.",
    "I've got saturated line colors.",
    "I've got bright areas here that are more saturated 'cause those saturated colors they come.",
    "The kind of.",
    "How do I just don't want to say they jump out at you first but like for example when you're looking at visual hierarchy, you'll see read first before you see many other colors because it's so bright and saturated.",
    "It's one of the first colors you See, And if you're looking comparing that, just something that's like a purple aura.",
    "Do saturated blue.",
    "You're going to see that brighter colored before, so we want to have those kind of.",
    "To highlight the things that you want to be noticed, uhm, and in that way I'll come through an I'll do that again so in this.",
    "In this case I said Alright, I'm in a forest setting.",
    "I've got bright blue Sky.",
    "I've got, you know these characters that are oranges, Browns, Blues.",
    "And so I need to pick my palette based on that.",
    "And so I did the same thing here.",
    "I picked my line art color, which is in this case the same Brown.",
    "I keep my oranges.",
    "I went through and I fixed some Reds even though I wasn't really sure I was going to use them.",
    "I was looking more for colors that I could put in trees and the natural setting that this is an so you can kind of see how I walked through here.",
    "I've got a lot of blue greens, I've got some yellows.",
    "And kind of greens that tend more towards yellow and red.",
    "And those are the ones that are closest to the viewer.",
    "If you're looking at here, the colours I picked here.",
    "Um, so I know that's not a really specific formula.",
    "This is how I do it, and this is how I make my pallets.",
    "But that's just kind of how I think about color and how I approach it in different things.",
    "I'll know that I want to certain mood and.",
    "Let me see if I can bring out a different example here.",
    "Um?",
    "Something recent that's a different color palette.",
    "Understand Castle.",
    "See.",
    "So.",
    "I really need to clean up my room.",
    "This is a different color palette here.",
    "Let me go over here and open this one up.",
    "This is a little bit different, so if I bring my Swatch pallets here you can see it's far more.",
    "Concise than previous pallets that I've shown you, Anas because I knew this was going to be a kind of a sunset.",
    "Seen an my sunset.",
    "Colors were the stuffed orange is the pinks the yellows and I also wanted cool shadows so I have.",
    "I have like really one purple and one blue that I operated 'cause I really wanted to push myself on it and have a nice big contrast and because this shack.",
    "That he's in is this is, you know.",
    "This is the sunlight it's coming this way, so I've got my cool shadows here with the bright light, bright and warm light here.",
    "And because the Sky is like this the water is going to reflect with above it so the water is going to be similar here and tell him.",
    "But I also wanted to kind of lay in a couple more kinks in here so you can kind of see here what I did.",
    "And then of course I had some little palm trees here so I had to throw in some greens there.",
    "So I guess to sum it up, how I go about my pallets is I think first about the mood of the thing that I'm coloring and the.",
    "The local natural color of what's in there?",
    "I think about that first, because, um.",
    "You kind of want to.",
    "There's an exercise that I've done a little bit of where you start an you're basically drawing in neutral, diffused light, so everything is its local natural color, which is a local color means.",
    "It's the color that it is without any lighting or effects applied to it.",
    "Like this is a Gray are missed, but if I put this armrest that's Gray in a room that's lit by very warm light, it's going to take on a little bit of a different color.",
    "Because the lights hitting the Gray and you know it's you know this fabric is either reflecting it or absorbing it, depending on how it is.",
    "Texture is an all that good stuff, so you think about you know first things that you're drawing the natural colors they are, and then you kind of start composing your palette.",
    "That way you can look for inspiration.",
    "Sometimes I've taken and done.",
    "Colour challenges to kind of get my feet wet in doing color exercises.",
    "There's one called Hugh member, where you take an your primary color for each illustration, one per day is based on a color wheel and that helped me a lot really to figure out how I construct my pallets an not all of them are fantastic at all, but it's just the method that I've developed and I think that's the most important thing is that.",
    "You develop a method of working in thinking your way through it that you can apply to many different settings, and that's just the methodical way that I do it.",
    "I say, OK, what time of day is this?",
    "What mood is it?",
    "What am I trying to convey?",
    "OK, I've got that in mind now what are the things I'm actually coloring?",
    "This is a bear with blue ears and white body.",
    "How is that going to play with really warm light?",
    "This is this is a beach side shack that has maybe.",
    "Dried out palm fronds as the roofing how is that going to play, you know, with sunlight kind of filtering out through it.",
    "You know these Frans.",
    "You know they may start out green when they're on the tree, but when they're off the tree in dead, they're going to be Brown and yellow, and you know kind of that different color.",
    "And so how is that going to play when my Sky is, you know, all these different colors?",
    "And how is that going to look in shadows that are cooler so?",
    "You know, that's kind of what's going on up here.",
    "When I start coloring things, and when I talk my way through it.",
    "I sometimes get into that, but sometimes I leave a lot of that out, so I'm glad you asked that question.",
    "Thank you.",
    "It's a little bit difficult to explain, but.",
    "I mean, I've gone through a lot of different color exercises and.",
    "You know colours theory books and articles that I've read and I get the conclusion that everybody kind of goes through things differently.",
    "This one that I really enjoyed was she described it as kind of like you have a turtle and you've got your primary three colors here.",
    "It's like the back of a turtle with a little with a little segments on it.",
    "You got your primary segments here and then you've got a complimentary two segments here and then you've got your highlight in the middle, and that's how she thought about color.",
    "And I thought that was really cool, but that really didn't.",
    "I mean, at the time that I didn't, that's not what I picked up and started using, but it informed me on my journey to find my own way.",
    "So, um.",
    "I hope that can help.",
    "Hum.",
    "But yeah, it looks like actually I shot over my time, so I think I will probably end the stream there.",
    "I just have these last little guys to color, which they're going to go super fast.",
    "It's just coconuts colors and my little lady boots.",
    "And then this where she's looking down at the paper in their hand so it's just going to be her pool color.",
    "Little bit of shading there, so maybe 30 minutes if that.",
    "And that includes the time to cut this up for.",
    "Uh.",
    "For Instagram and it's going to be pretty easy as I have.",
    "Let's see I only have one panel that needs to be connected so.",
    "That always makes it easy.",
    "But yeah, so let me say there and let me put up my ending screen.",
    "Oh, you're welcome here soon.",
    "Let's see, there we go alright, so my next stream on Behance will be next Tuesday and Tuesdays are.",
    "I'd like to call them challenge Tuesdays.",
    "I do anything from you know, seen studies too.",
    "Actually, the image that you're seeing right now on my ending screen was a challenge Tuesday.",
    "The challenge in this one was the camera angle, and because it's unusual for me to do the top down view, so I had to think my way through that.",
    "and I also had to think my way through.",
    "These characters sitting in a boat floating on top of the water, kind of addressing these fish who are half in and half out so that and then of course all of the greenery in plants that are happening in half out of water.",
    "That was the challenge there, so I haven't decided what my topic for next challenge Tuesday is.",
    "This past Tuesday I was drawing in notes for stickers, so that's Tuesday and then Thursday will be another com extreme.",
    "If you want to join me there.",
    "Otherwise, I also stream on Twitch Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Fridays are a little bit more of a relaxed stream.",
    "I do sketching for the first portion and then I do.",
    "Gaming for the final and this Friday is going to be a fan art Friday with never ending stories, so that's exciting and fun.",
    "It is from pleasant moments that are thank you so much as you.",
    "Thank you too.",
    "Thank you so much for joining me.",
    "I hope you guys have a great rest of your Thursday and I'll see you next time.",
