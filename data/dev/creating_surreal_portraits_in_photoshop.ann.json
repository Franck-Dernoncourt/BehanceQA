    "Hello everyone hello everyone at this late hour.",
    "Could I have your I'm just doing some livestreaming on testing out a couple things I'm going to be doing some surreal portraits in photo shop and it's good to have you here.",
    "So I'm going to go ahead and?",
    "Go live right now.",
    "All right.",
    "Welcome everyone good to have you here.",
    "Palm training diving into some Photoshop magic.",
    "Hopefully you appreciate this looks like.",
    "Everything is live and again just got a new set up and I'm super excited about it.",
    "So if you are out there.",
    "Feel free to say hello that be fantastic because otherwise I feel quite alone and.",
    "Nobody likes to be alone right This is actually a sneak preview of some stuff.",
    "I'm going to be doing tomorrow.",
    "You can see right here, creating some surreal portraits.",
    "I posted this to Instagram.",
    "2 days ago and realized it has some issues.",
    "Some of the issues are really this jaw line right here.",
    "How drastic that is.",
    "It's pretty intense.",
    "So this is one thing I need to fix and I could use your critical eye as well so.",
    "Fantastic.",
    "So yeah, thank you for my viewers on Periscope or Twitter or whatever.",
    "You wanna call it as well as be hands.",
    "Also on YouTube.",
    "So this is the issue.",
    "I need to fix like this gap.",
    "This is looks funny.",
    "You know what I didn't notice it and this might happen to you.",
    "You won't notice something weird until like a day later when you wake up and you look at it and you're like Oh.",
    "I need to fix that right.",
    "It's that jaw piece right here.",
    "So actually what I'm going to do is going to command J.",
    "I'm going to jump that or duplicate that layer right here.",
    "I'm going to try to create something I'll maybe delete that layer mask.",
    "I actually need a flip it command T flip horizontal and I'm just going to try to get like it just needs a little something right there, so that's all I'm doing for this little portrait or whatever.",
    "You want to call it as I start to kind of Patch that in and again.",
    "We're just going to kind of play with.",
    "What I think that will work and it's going to actually probably take a little distorting so feel free to say hello would love to hear from you.",
    "Would be great again, nobody's up?",
    "At this hour except for me.",
    "Um again see this piece is going to bring that out, like so.",
    "Maybe it's that part of the job.",
    "But I can also do is I can convert this to a smart object right.",
    "So now that it's a smart object, and that's just this jaw.",
    "I can start to distort this a little bit and what I actually like to use a lot of is right over here puppet warp so that's what I want to do for this one so edit puppet warp.",
    "Adding some pins right in here, pinning down some parts that I don't want to move and then maybe grabbing some of this and kind of pulling it out OK.",
    "So that's all I'm doing is trying to pull that out, and make it look less weird is kind of the thought OK, so let me know what you think would love to hear from you.",
    "About anything that looks funny.",
    "But I think it just needs a little something extra on this side right.",
    "So it's just not so funny looking already that looks like a lot better, but it looks like she has really big teeth so.",
    "Yes, Steve late in the evening for me.",
    "Thank you Steve for Chiming in your in New Zealand.",
    "So it's probably early for you.",
    "Anuar feel free.",
    "Let me OK cool, yeah, OK easy time for you in New Zealand.",
    "It's 7:50 PM OK.",
    "It's like.",
    "Almost midnight here in.",
    "Goodall Denver, sorry I've been sneezing, too, which is not good.",
    "But I'm fixing this whole like horsemouth issue and I think I fixed it?",
    "What do you think Steve?",
    "Let me know what you think uh must go ahead and show that full screen tab tab?",
    "Not sure why both tabs are not working.",
    "But I think that looks a little better, so let me know what you think Steve.",
    "And Anwar would be awesome.",
    "This is Ginger Ale by the way I don't know make a weird.",
    "All right.",
    "I think I fixed it so That being said, I want to move on to the next one right.",
    "Um.",
    "I could save this we can go into the history of panel and I can see this start?",
    "This is where it started from.",
    "And then here is kind of where I've ended up with that and what I was doing was fixing this part right here, making it look a little less weird.",
    "I hope I did it.",
    "Ah.",
    "The texture on the skeleton is a bit odd.",
    "Uhm yeah, maybe you're right.",
    "I mean, it is a gold the texture.",
    "So the cool thing is, is I can fix that, so I can go into dimension by the way I don't know why this has been saving for 3 days.",
    "So I might have to force quit dimension, it literally is been saving for a couple days.",
    "I thought I'd give it time.",
    "Let's force quit that baby I might have lost that file that kind of sucks.",
    "Basically, that's a texture that I made so I actually do not have that exact view, which is a bummer.",
    "Julia good to see you here.",
    "Yeah, it's midnight.",
    "You are up late as well.",
    "I'm testing out actually my new setup if you're curious to see how it looks.",
    "I'll have to post it too.",
    "I don't know Instagram stories, or something but got a whole new set up here that I'm kind of testing out and I'm also testing bandwidth, which seems to be pretty good.",
    "So yeah, what I do is jump in here and I actually used.",
    "I think I used a silver mirror.",
    "But I could have used a natural gold and then I have this damaged gold right so that's why it's a matter of.",
    "Give me a second I'm in miscellaneous.",
    "I control down models and I used a couple things here.",
    "'cause check this out.",
    "Stylize skeleton boom drop in this in this is actually what I would do Muriel.",
    "Yes, I am going to go to Lisbon lucky enough to go to Lisbon, Portugal for Adobe Max Europe.",
    "There's a debate on whether it should be.",
    "They're wondering if it should like they're concerned that you know they don't want it to mimic.",
    "Um.",
    "The US version, too much so.",
    "They might kind of change it a little bit.",
    "But what I'm doing is I'm selecting a couple.",
    "I got this fibula pelvis.",
    "I'm deleting.",
    "No yeah, I do need to delete that.",
    "Fibula as well, we're learning about.",
    "The human body.",
    "I didn't hear.",
    "I'm guessing with parts.",
    "I actually don't need a lot of this, but I'm actually going to render this out.",
    "This all looks pretty good.",
    "Do you wanna tell me how have you been have you been liking Colorado?",
    "Tell me these little spots right here?",
    "Um.",
    "Narrators Patella so using this tool right over here and again.",
    "I'm in Adobe.",
    "Dimension selecting the sampler tool.",
    "Oh, sorry not the sampler tool.",
    "The one above it so right there.",
    "Magic wand tool.",
    "I can click right on that object OK.",
    "That's the Patella.",
    "We're learning things right.",
    "But it enables me to just locate that specific item right.",
    "It's actually not what it's used for but it's like Super Helpful.",
    "In finding.",
    "I'm actually deleting the textures, but ultimately I get to delete.",
    "The.",
    "Object itself.",
    "Yes, it is a little cold.",
    "'cause if you're coming from where you would think you were in El A.",
    "Before this.",
    "Correct me if I'm wrong, but, yeah, it is a little cold just so you know it actually has not been this cold.",
    "In awhile so I think this is like a rarity to be honest with you.",
    "This is usually not this cold.",
    "We usually don't have snow on the ground for this long, but when we do it's usually happens.",
    "In February, an March OK, so we have really relate winters, but it's no different.",
    "Then any other place sorry if this is not that interesting to some people I think you're learning, you should be learning a lot.",
    "Right in here, grabbing this pelvis right.",
    "OK, so that looks good enough so sorry there's so much.",
    "I need to do right in here and it's because I lost a file but what I want to do is actually want to match this up with an image that I already have so I'll jump into people.",
    "Um and hope that view by group.",
    "Right 'cause I have everything categories categorized nice and neat.",
    "Uhm it's just a matter of where I put that specific one which might be.",
    "Ah.",
    "Actually, no, I'm sorry, it is a stone element, so I apologize.",
    "We're going to ride this out for a little bit.",
    "And we'll go back to miscellaneous so sorry about that, but I have a zillion different things in here.",
    "That I need to kind of take care of textures patterns.",
    "Miscellaneous category for all of this ultimately.",
    "I want to have dive into the statues.",
    "I'm sorry I'm not as.",
    "I feel a little less prepared, but again, I'm just testing live streaming right now to make sure my.",
    "Other computer can actually keep up.",
    "OK, male female lifestyle motion, not grouped OK I need statue.",
    "Let's try this out there, it is there, it is dropping it in the background, you got it OK so.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Ah.",
    "What Julia you're going to Florida?",
    "Hey Rufus, what's up, buddy, I'm just testing some live streaming?",
    "That's why it's a little late here, but it seems to be working out well.",
    "I got a kind of a nice setup.",
    "I actually have them re purposing an old monitor that I have.",
    "You can see actually dropped in this background right in here that I want to use so it's kind of go into the properties right in here.",
    "We see background match image and what I want to do is actually resize.",
    "The canvas and create lights based on that background image 'cause.",
    "I'm going to have this 3D object.",
    "Sort of mimic this particular pose so that's the idea.",
    "So yes, Rufus I'm like so excited about going to Lisbon.",
    "I mean, it's just like so thrilled.",
    "It's going to be awesome.",
    "Super excited about it, so this is just the background.",
    "So what's nice about this?",
    "Is I can control this whole plane right?",
    "And it's not going to mess up this background image.",
    "But I can kind of get this into position.",
    "I'll typically kinda like zoom in more.",
    "I could also resize this skeleton as well.",
    "But ultimately what I need to do is I need to get rid of this head place a new head on there and actually use some of my textures that I have already squared away.",
    "Clear right there by the way I can actually use.",
    "Substance painter to actually make my own textures, but I happen to have some in here already.",
    "Give me one second people.",
    "Let's actually go into the starter assets 'cause.",
    "I know right in here.",
    "We have textures down here.",
    "So I can grab some clean gold drop it.",
    "On that particular shape.",
    "You see what it's going to do it might sometimes just apply it to that specific object So what you can always do is grab.",
    "This scratch texture and Drop it on the layers panel and that will apply it everywhere as well so that might be easier when it comes to applying textures or materials afraid you're right.",
    "It is it is Valentine's Day.",
    "Happy Valentine's Day.",
    "To you as well so again I can get this into position.",
    "The reason I'm doing this is because Steve was kind enough to point out that like maybe there's something weird about the gold texture.",
    "I think he might be right.",
    "I will say what the issue might be is that it.",
    "Might not be reflecting enough of the statue around it, so that's kind of the issue here.",
    "But I think we've already done a good job of kind of fixing the skeleton in this part so I'm just going to go ahead and call this done, but I did want to point out how this was originally made which was by taking this positioning.",
    "It's based on that photo in the background, rendering it OK.",
    "And then doing some compositing in Photoshop.",
    "Ha.",
    "Yeah, the rendering I don't know I think the renderings pretty strong.",
    "I don't think we've it's still verea under the hood by the way so I don't think we've changed anything there.",
    "There is cloud, rendering now, which is nice.",
    "But since I have a bunch of experts with me today.",
    "Yeah, and that's OK.",
    "I think it maybe maybe the issue is Steve by the way if it's being actually kind of exposed through this statue.",
    "Maybe it's actually like super rough so actually what I should use is used some of this damaged wait for it.",
    "So.",
    "Sorry.",
    "Libraries come on now where is it miscellaneous?",
    "Yeah, better being here 3D?",
    "I got so much stuff in here look at all this stuff Oh that's why the check this out.",
    "You can sometimes view by type in view by group OK, so you ever can't can't find something you could view by type.",
    "It 'cause I know I need to find a material.",
    "I just don't know where it is now I can.",
    "Locate this damaged material right here.",
    "Drop it on an again.",
    "I can drop it.",
    "On the layers panel.",
    "It's going to go ahead and apply it and this might be something that Steve is looking for so it is rougher.",
    "I do also need to make sure that.",
    "The lighting also comes from uh.",
    "The image as well so everything looks good, there, the environment light comes from that image.",
    "And then we have a couple other lights so maybe this will work better.",
    "I don't know.",
    "I think it's still like 2 yellow.",
    "I'm not huge fan of it, but it's kind of move on.",
    "All right.",
    "Cool Julia Yeah, so that's all I did by the way Julie if you're interested again.",
    "I rendered this out.",
    "I put this as a background.",
    "I positioned everything into place and then I rendered it.",
    "The cool thing is, is once you render it.",
    "You then have everything in layers.",
    "Um, I'd have to kind of dig through.",
    "Oh, here, we go here's here's the situation after the render this is what you have.",
    "You have something like this?",
    "You can see this layers panel and the skeleton might be a little bright for Steve that's OK.",
    "We can take that background image duplicate it put it on Top.",
    "Close that up what I do with this background image.",
    "I'm just going to go ahead and Rasterize.",
    "It 'cause I like having access to this remove background buttons right in here.",
    "Remove background now.",
    "I have this right on type.",
    "This background OK.",
    "Let's take that let's take this, let's apply that as a mask.",
    "I'm doing stuff kind of quick, but this is what's happening exposed underneath that woman is going to be the skeleton so I'm going to turn that on I'm going to go ahead and convert this to a smart object.",
    "So I still have that layer mask in case I need it.",
    "I'm going to create a new layer mask and I'm going to start painting with black.",
    "You guys did you know how it works hard round zometa use come in here and start painting over this.",
    "I'm going to make sure the flow is set up to 100% and I'm kind of revealing some of the skeleton right there as you can see how that's done OK.",
    "Um.",
    "You probably also notice that this does not have the devil, so there's a couple different ways to do this.",
    "I can actually double click on this layer and add bevel and emboss to this layer and I'm going to make sure that's on an inner bevel OK and the lighting comes from say like the upper left would be good OK.",
    "It's still pretty intense.",
    "I can kind of take that down.",
    "Tweek this all I want I actually wanted to be a little more shallow so I'm going to take the size down but that's what I have right there OK.",
    "They are good to have you here.",
    "Thea I did not know you see it's good to have you here.",
    "This is why it's good to kind of broadcast?",
    "I guess at different times again just kind of testing out.",
    "Testing out my.",
    "New set up that I'm so proud of.",
    "And I'm glad I can do this and actually everything's been going at.",
    "100%.",
    "Sweet get right in here, I can take this opacity down as well.",
    "That gives me like a quick preview of some of these parts.",
    "I can kind of add that just get the sternum.",
    "Some of the ribs, maybe thin, it up a little bit like do some little dots right there.",
    "You get the idea.",
    "Just kind of having some fun with this here like so OK cool.",
    "Down here you get the idea.",
    "Right adding to this and the increasing the Opacity.",
    "So obviously like revealing it.",
    "It is an all or nothing issue.",
    "I would actually kind of come in here and as I add this.",
    "I know I need to add some shading later because this is not.",
    "This skeleton is not really respecting a whole lot of the shading so new layer and I've been like sneezing like crazy.",
    "Brush.",
    "Adding a brush taking the actually you know what this is what I have for my so many things.",
    "Mike I get to see you buddy.",
    "Yeah, Chris This is a late live stream that is exactly right.",
    "I'm going to use old softy that's what I call it's brush I made but I just know it's going to be a soft brush with only 2% flow.",
    "'cause all I want to do is like add a little bit of shading right down here on this particular skeleton just making it nice and smooth and make sure it respects kind of the lighting of this particular photo right you get the idea.",
    "Let's go back up here always changes back to hard round.",
    "'cause I'm going to expose more.",
    "Later on as well boom boom.",
    "Crank it up.",
    "So.",
    "Sorry.",
    "Wrong layer there, we are.",
    "Ah.",
    "White painting with White, 100% opacity.",
    "I'm on the wrong layer that's the problem didn't you hate it after freaking 25 years.",
    "I'm still painting on the wrong layer right.",
    "It's always like the little things.",
    "But right in here just kind of reveal more because I think it's more interesting when you can kind of see more of the chest and just be kind of like cooler for our stream today.",
    "Add some like so open to your opinions.",
    "I think 2 minds are better than one.",
    "Yeah, it's late here in early somewhere else.",
    "Julia you are going to did you say Florida soon?",
    "That's super cool.",
    "All right.",
    "Right in here.",
    "There we go now you know how this is made.",
    "Uh say Steve mocked up a bunch of wrong layers as well, OK, so you get the idea of how this was essentially created and how I got to this point.",
    "I want to Fast forward by the way I did a lot of color treatment.",
    "I can do more with this.",
    "I want to fast more forward to this one.",
    "I was actually working on this early today to live stream on it, and we can talk about some of the issues that you have with it.",
    "'cause a lot of this, you need to just kind of respect.",
    "The lighting.",
    "So where's the lighting coming from well essentially I'm having the lighting come from?",
    "Up here right This is where the light source should be so that's why right in here.",
    "I'm going to have some shadow, but also I need to make parts of these a little bit darker.",
    "Parts of these Flowers, OK, so that's the big issue and then we can work on some color correction things like Julie's doing some packing.",
    "For Florida, you are up late 'cause.",
    "It is midnight here in beautiful.",
    "Denver Co where myself and Julia Live.",
    "She's South of me and Highlands Ranch.",
    "I love Highlands Ranch.",
    "I know that area all too well.",
    "And yet I'm really into it, you take 470 around to the airport makes it super easy right.",
    "You see a number of things that were put together all that it is I split this.",
    "I used warp distorted it and you get the idea Mohammed from China.",
    "OK Mohammed from China welcome OK.",
    "Some little parts right here like this bothers me like this needs some more shading So what I can do hold down the command key and then you can click another thing you can do as well.",
    "And this is brand new if I hold down the option key and click on that layer.",
    "I can zoom right to that object right and here is the object that I need to work on there is little issues that you know.",
    "Need to be fixed like there's a little bit of.",
    "Um sort of glowy edge right here that needs to be taken care of right that needs to be fixed.",
    "If we really got in all the details like right in here look at that.",
    "Somebody didn't do a good job of cleaning this up.",
    "But you know what this is a library item so I clean it off once and then it fixes.",
    "All of my compositions.",
    "'cause if you know me hyper I've used Flowers away, too much.",
    "That's the short of it, OK brush.",
    "Fixing that's changing this.",
    "Right in here, I have a brightness and contrast layer.",
    "So why do that it allows me to make this all darker?",
    "I have these darker elements but I actually get to paint with that darkness so on that layer had beef brush and I'm going to start painting with white an essentially even though I'm hanging on the white this actually making those parts darker so I can kind of darker dark and this part inside of here just kind of adding a little bit more depth to each one of these like little pedals for these Flowers.",
    "Maybe on the inside here, you get the idea just giving it a little bit more depth.",
    "So it's not so flat again, you can see that I've done some of that work already.",
    "It's a little bit, too, dark as I zoom out.",
    "I can go back into brightness and contrast and increase that brightness just a touch alright cool mirror.",
    "I'll have a good day at work and get a roll I get it.",
    "All right.",
    "Fantastic always add more drama open to whatever else this needs, but you can see how this is put together it actually.",
    "I think it looks pretty good.",
    "We have some little parts right here.",
    "That kind of need to be fixed.",
    "Those little dots.",
    "Those actually come from the original photo.",
    "It's nice.",
    "We can hold on the command key and click on those.",
    "I can see it's part of this flower.",
    "So for that particular flower.",
    "I'm going to select those parts.",
    "Unless he said that as a mask, there, you go boom done.",
    "More drama that's why we need drama in a good way.",
    "So I would say I don't know.",
    "I'm open to opinion.",
    "I don't know if this is really working or not working.",
    "If you're having an issue with any design that you're working on yeah, definitely take a step away.",
    "I could already see when I look at it on my second monitor the fact that I'm seeing it.",
    "Smaller I'm kind of noticing some weirdness like.",
    "Does it even need this flower here like maybe less is more for some of this right great thing is how this is put together right, I can kind of move that down.",
    "Like so right.",
    "I don't know if it's really working that's why I need you guys.",
    "OK, so Steve brings up a great point, perhaps a be on one of those Flowers did it.",
    "Do we introduce some elements kind of around.",
    "These Flowers rather than everything crammed into one area and I think that's a great idea.",
    "I'm not going to be.",
    "I'm actually going to use a butterfly 'cause.",
    "Guess what I have 1000 butterflies right.",
    "You can see them all right in here and straw in like I'm doing right now.",
    "The big thing is, is if I'm doing any sort of compositing.",
    "I want to make sure that the size is realistic.",
    "So I'm not going to have this beat or excuse me.",
    "This butterfly, too large or too small.",
    "I want to make sure it's the right size.",
    "Considering the size of this woman's face flip that around adjust it move it.",
    "You know, and I can drop it into place, the nice thing.",
    "I like about this is I can actually put this kind of off a little bit.",
    "And I also need to consider the colour because the yellow introduces like almost like a new color.",
    "It's almost too intense compared to this washed out yellow down here.",
    "Ooh Yes, Steve you are brilliant.",
    "Love the idea of a Hummingbird.",
    "Love the idea of a Hummingbird, you're so good.",
    "Right.",
    "So again for this butterfly, I would probably.",
    "Go into human saturation.",
    "Clip that to that layer mask.",
    "And.",
    "Kind of play with that a little bit.",
    "I don't know.",
    "Again, you play with it each time you play something you kind of learn something more.",
    "How do you export from dimension 2 photo shop it was easy you don't need to export you just do a render so right in here after this side instead of entitled you'd say, you know skeleton.",
    "Hi for slow let's do low for fast.",
    "It's going to render out a PSD and it's going to give you all those layers so super easy big thing I do is save this file save as.",
    "Wait, for it to the desktop.",
    "Boom boom render and guess what you can actually do crowd crap cloud rendering as well.",
    "Saving the desktop.",
    "Although I'm not sure why it's not allowing me to render right now that button should be available, so anyways.",
    "That's where this came from.",
    "This could use some sparkles as well, I had to update photo shop so ilost.",
    "All my sparkles which is just so bad have been testing.",
    "Some new versions.",
    "'cause we have some new things coming next week?",

    "What else do we have we got this sweet 1.",
    "Sure, the shape dynamics change, so the size is going to change.",
    "The angle is going to change right we can see a little preview right down here just going to look so cool and then we're going to scatter it as well going to crank up the scattering.",
    "Analysts make sure the minutes.",

    "I could always take.",
    "These settings lock them.",
    "Locking all of those the shape dynamics and scattering that's what I played with and then pick a different brush.",
    "Let's try that on a new layer.",
    "It's going to be this burst.",
    "Let's make it smaller.",
    "Let's test it out boom OK perfect there's are sparkles.",

    "'cause chances are you're not going to be able to find you might be able to but you might not be able to find an image with that perfect angle of that item so that's one 3D comes into play.",
    "We're going to make it look realistic and we have some fun so it cheers Steve and a frozen everyone.",
    "Have a good one Rufus if you're still there and Julia as she finishes packing hopefully soon Mohammed.",
