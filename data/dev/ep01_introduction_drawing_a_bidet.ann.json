    "Awesome so I'm just gonna get done today so.",
    "I usually start with a last sketch, uhm?",
    "She looks like this.",
    "I think that last piece of paper and then finally squiggles, and the graph sketches about what I really.",
    "But the general exo skeleton of the sketches better look like.",
    "And then I see it making reiterations of how it's gonna look and how it's going to feel.",
    "And then I get it onto illustrator where I kind of.",
    "I.",
    "Where I'm at the lines super clean and finalized.",
    "You know certain way and I just get it out prior to streaming just so.",
    "Um?",
    "It is.",

    "Uh.",
    "Moosch What section of design do you like more now the two things with three years of school motion, branding, illustrations or packaging, I kind of prefer branding more because.",

    "Join local issue there first because it's a lot and it's actually the first creative cloud program that I learn how to use.",
    "So I guess it's probably.",
    "My most comfortable and I feel like I, I know a lot more about it.",
    "I'm not gonna really teach anything on the stream, but if you like me to like, I'm just going to keep working and doing.",
    "And if you guys have any questions as to how I get something or if you like me to further explain.",
    "What I'm doing I can do that as well.",
    "So as you can see here, like I mentioned before, I start with the basic sketch and then starts up with like simple line to do so as to what I really think the illustration is going to look like, and then I further develop it and do.",
    "Fully form sketches and then bring it on to illustrator to clean up the lines.",
    "And then.",
    "I make another.",
    "Uh.",
    "The set of lying on a different layer just to see the shadows and how it's going to.",
    "Look with terms of cheating and highlights.",
    "So I do really like Swirlies and spirally things.",
    "I'm not quite sure how to explain it, but I think I think it looks really satisfying to me.",
    "So you should just talk with using the pencil tool and I use a Wakeham tablet.",
    "Really small one just because it's easier to carry around and it's not portable and I also don't have a lot of space.",
    "In terms of.",
    "So that's just possibly moving from college, and that's fine.",
    "So I could end on the keyboard, which is a shortcut for the pencil tool and use my stylus with trying to draw on the back on tablet.",
    "So as you can see, this is a Super Rough SketchUp.",
    "Well, as as rough as it can be looked on illustrator so.",
    "I prefer having all the lines closed, so you could do that.",
    "Well, just hitting a for the White Arrow.",
    "Arrow key and then double clicking on it and it's connecting to the shapes because eventually I'm going to be using the live paint bucket when you just fill in the colour so it's easier than having to scribble and draw the actual color.",
    "Um?",
    "And I do get a lot of questions as to how.",
    "Oh, I see.",
    "What do they use?",
    "Because I do use photo shop for in the later stages of my illustrations.",
    "The time is given a more organic view.",
    "So it looks like it's a vector, but kind of looks like it's been wrong.",
    "It looks more organic.",
    "And so, right now I'm just getting around to see if there's any more open shapes and you can see this month.",
    "And then.",
    "Losing it up just so it's easier to.",
    "Like this?",
    "So what I'm going to do is I'm going to select.",
    "The lines for the shadows.",
    "These were just super rough.",
    "I might change them later on depending on how to look and see your progress is.",
    "And I'm just going to copy it and delete it.",
    "And make a new layer.",
    "Just face.",
    "That's the man.",
    "Command after basically so we faced exactly where you.",
    "Copied it from.",
    "Just label them ears.",
    "You're too.",
    "Bunch of us says it looks like a snake shaking my head.",
    "Yes, yes it does.",
    "You carry debiti around everywhere.",
    "Yes, I do.",
    "I carry it around whenever I travel because I was used to use for the paper.",
    "Annoying.",
    "I'm sure you can agree that we do.",
    "And let me know if I Mumble because I do mumble a lot and the Mike is a little further away than I mean that it supposed to be.",
    "And also because there's just such less space now, you might just be looking at my forehead in the bottom corner of the screen.",
    "So.",
    "Yeah, just.",
    "Let me know.",
    "Um, so now I'm just going to meet lines, uhm?",
    "And like kind of a linear pattern all around.",
    "Disney.",
    "The baby's name.",
    "I think.",
    "Another question.",

    "What about the day's inspired you for this, but these are amazing.",
    "It is are the best.",
    "There there is the best in the bum washing business.",
    "I highly recommend you use it if you already gone.",
    "It's so much more convenient.",
    "It's a lot easier.",
    "It costs less.",
    "It's better for the environment is World Environment Day on Friday so.",
    "I'm gonna use that as an excuse to raise awareness about saving water and also.",
    "Think about it from.",
    "A dishwashing perspective, but you Wash.",
    "Would you clean your dishes with paper or would you wash them?",
    "I mean, there's a reason why you off them so.",
    "That is, Mike, that's my main argument.",
    "No us wait.",
    "How big is affordable today?",
    "Uh, it's it's in my bag.",
    "It sits in a little bag is about this big.",
    "Uh, the size of my face.",

    "Motivation?",
    "Hum.",
    "And it's kinda nice to be at.",

    "In New York and and it worked there for at least most of the summer, then come back for a few weeks to Delhi.",
    "Uhm, but that didn't workout unfortunately, but.",
    "I try my best to kind of live in the moment when I'm at home and when I'm there I try not to think about home when I'm in New York and I try not to think about.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Just so I appreciate it looks the moment tonight.",
    "Animals and also aware that I'm not going to have as much time in the future to be home.",

    "Julia ask, how do you drive up after using up the data?",
    "I think that's very bad with paper comes in, you can use toilet paper to dry up.",
    "After that's exactly function just a few tabs, nothing, nothing more.",
    "Uh.",
    "Amy, I can't tell how much of this comment are you serious?",
    "Make of it as you will.",
    "I see you toilet paper in the toilet paper in the debate.",
    "Is there is a debate very close to my heart?",
    "I take it very personally and I will get you seated discussions with you about that, but hopefully this illustration after the date can convince you.",
    "Because they are.",
    "A man should ask, what about New York inspires you the most isn't much is New York is just amazing because?",
    "There's just so many fate of people around and so many things you could do that, then data we inspire you.",
    "Um?",
    "Also, if you're a creative, you're probably going to.",
    "Be in New York at some point here in some point in your life, or you're already.",
    "There is kind of the place to be.",
    "Most of my biggest inspirations.",
    "Live in New York, and that's also one of the reasons why.",
    "I was so attracted to it in the first place.",
    "My dad likes to tell a story about me that.",
    "We we went to visit when I was around 3 two or three years old and he keeps it tells me that.",
    "After I said I told him I'm going to be rich and famous banker in New York and buy them reports.",
    "I live in New York.",
    "Yes.",
    "I don't think banking is.",
    "Something I can really dive into right now, but hopefully design.",
    "I see it is clear itself.",
    "Figures But yeah, it's great because.",
    "Especially with SVA school visual arts.",
    "All the professors are working professionals, so you have people like Debbie Millman, Jessica Wall, Stefan Sagmeister of teaching at sea or people I grew up reading about grew up reading about.",
    "Looking at, there were convenience fired by, so just being in a building or knowing that you're in a building with them or having the opportunity to take classes with them is is just amazing.",

    "Is very driven and very creatively driven.",
    "Super genuinely nice and we just need just a melting pot of different cultures.",
    "It doesn't really feel like you're in a particular country.",
    "Seems like you're just in a in a city of the world because it is so many people.",
    "That you can interact with and just be around.",
    "So I think that's probably the most inspiring part because it doesn't really seem like there anywhere except New York.",
    "It doesn't feel like you're in America.",
    "It just feels like a city of the world, so that's probably the most inspiring.",
    "Uh.",
    "Any asks how do you keep inspired requiring team?",
    "Uh, to be honest, I haven't been inspired.",
    "Uhm, I.",
    "I've just been trying to.",
    "Take a step back at least because with everything going on I feel like it's getting a bit too much, but.",
    "Trying to think about things that may be creatively inspired at the time to revisit both projects are probably work on that.",
    "In the future episode while constraining for you guys and probably get your guys opinions about it and we can make it a more collaborative process.",
    "But for the most part.",
    "I've been a little inspired, but not as much as I'd like to be, but I feel like that's getting better.",
    "I'm doing something right now, so.",
    "Yeah, I I guess like watching other people staying on the hands as well have been super inspiring just because.",
    "You can see the different types of people screaming.",
    "Sharing that one, including you in here I saw everyone should go check out Amy's work and he needs stream anything.",
    "Wanna be happy?",
    "She's a super talented typographer designer and.",

    "Uh, yeah.",
    "Few people in my family are bankers.",
    "I think the biggest.",
    "Bankers are very generic term.",
    "I think I mean I don't know much about it, so I'm probably not to talk about it.",
    "Hum.",
    "More or less what is in your favorite experience at SV is so far the people and learning.",
    "The people have been super inspiring and Super Lucky to have and be surrounded by amazing friends and amazing people.",
    "Designers, film makers, illustrators, painters.",
    "Just getting to know.",
    "The people around me and interacting with them because there's so much cooler than I am.",
    "More experience said a lot of things and we just learn a lot from each other and I think that's always been the most rewarding experience.",
    "And Yeah, my name is famous.",
    "David experiences been talking to people with tracking people.",
    "Talking to people that.",
    "I.",
    "I'm inspired by it like as I mentioned before, allowed designers each at SVA so they even being stuck in an elevator or walking up the stairs and crossing them in the hallway.",
    "Just super cool today.",
    "There's a reason I'm there, so I would.",
    "For other websites, or stop their instagrams and.",
    "Here there listen to them, talk for, listen to them on podcast so to see people in Spain inspired by that motivated me to come pick you up in the first place.",
    "In the flesh has been really able.",
    "So I'm still just drawing more to linear pattern and any time to fix that.",
    "And then we can get onto actually coloring it.",
    "I'm also just going to double check and make sure all the lines of clothes so there also shapes that I can.",
    "Filling later with us.",
    "With the paper.",
    "Yeah, so this is just the meaning sketch that I started with.",
    "Like I mentioned before, I start with an exo skeleton with just a few sweetly lines and then further develop that into a little more refined sketch.",
    "And then I bring that into illustrator, draw over it and candles.",
    "Develop equipment so.",
    "Yeah, I'm just going to hide that field now.",
    "So this is probably what.",
    "The basic lines are gonna look like, uhm, I added The Shadow lines before whenever you can see are.",
    "So we want to add a little more shadows just sorts.",
    "More convenient.",
    "Amy says also, I think this chat is lagging behind a bit, so this is my response to you talking about my sweet love.",
    "She says no no.",
    "Yes yes you should be saying yes everybody should check anything up.",
    "She's great.",
    "More questions if you have any Ohio 19 people watching, that's amazing.",
    "Thank you for.",
    "Spending wasting your time with me.",
    "I'm just going to draw a few more of the shadows.",
    "Is everything is better when it hasn't yet?",
    "I feel like most working other status tends to look a little flat, so just adding a little dimension to it as always.",
    "Hum.",
    "Oh no.",
    "You made a mistake.",
    "So I'm going to copy this and get rid of the.",
    "The previous lines.",
    "Yeah, so it's easier to.",
    "It's all good later.",
    "Yep.",
    "And it's Command F2.",
    "Basically this again.",
    "Yes, I'm just deleting.",
    "The access lines that I just made it on a separate layer which I should have done before.",
    "Should I switch it on a separate layer but?",
    "It's too distracted talking to you guys.",
    "Hum.",
    "So that others, are you seeing an increased influence on the global political prices on the art you consume?",
    "Or three age?",
    "Um, which global political crisis there are few going on?",
    "But yeah, I see like.",
    "Making art is super important in terms of expressing your opinions and.",
    "For the betterment of society in terms of raising awareness about things.",
    "But we should also remember why we why we are creating are combined with sharing part.",
    "It shouldn't be to promote our own.",
    "From what ourselves and promote our work, it should be.",
    "You should really think about how.",
    "We're adding to the conversation in terms of our art, and so we're trying to.",
    "Work towards.",
    "Benefiting What's actually going on through your work?",
    "So I guess that's the main thing 'cause I see.",
    "I've seen a lot of.",
    "Artist.",
    "Kind of share just for the sake of sharing as it thing without actually being.",
    "Do sincere, or at least that's what it comes with process.",
    "So in terms of the work I'm in creating as I'm kind of taking a step back to really think about that at the moment that's been playing a lot on my mind.",
    "Hum.",
    "What is my work?",
    "Contributed to what is it?",
    "What am I getting out of it?",
    "When are people getting out of it?",
    "So these are questions that I ask myself and figure out so maybe I'll hopefully have an answer for you.",
    "In the future, once I have.",
    "And I thought about it properly.",
    "So this more shadows.",
    "This probably doesn't make sense to.",
    "At the moment, but I, I swear.",
    "Hum.",
    "Julius, how often do you draw your work on paper before digital?",
    "Digitalized always I always love my work on paper.",
    "I see like starting with a pen and paper is probably the best way.",
    "That's how I've always been doing it.",
    "As I prefer doing it because you can just.",
    "It's a lot easier to keep reiterating and I sometimes I do just pop on digitally because depending on time constraints, but I do prefer or do try and use paper as much as possible just so it's a better idea of is in your force.",
    "You're forced to redo it when you're on when you're trying to make a digital, so anything that you.",
    "Any mistake that you see on any error that you make this a lot easier to fix 'cause you had your taking it through a filter so you're doing it twice so the second time around it's the second time around you do.",
    "It is obviously going to be better so if you keep doing it and might be better, but it's also important to not over do it.",
    "Most says we're not wasting our time there.",
    "There is no other way I would like to spend my Sunday.",
    "Also, do you think you will make any work for black lives matter?",
    "Thank you for thinking you're not wasting your time with me.",
    "We will not be offended.",
    "Do I think I will be making any work for black guys mapping?",

    "Just have to make sure all my lines are closed and.",
    "So it's easier for me to.",
    "And it just paint bucket over there.",

    "Let's see what do I do?",
    "Um, Samsung had the shadows really quickly.",
    "Hello.",
    "Then we can get rid of the line, so it's just the shadows.",

    "Man kind of display around with that.",
    "Maybe 20.",
    "Fine.",
    "Other different ways that you can do this?",
    "You can do it with a Penguin and bump up the stroke and then reduce the Opacity.",

    "Oh Abby, shake us might have been talked about before, but how did your usual creative routine if that something changed during lockdown?",
    "Have you found a new process for sale?",

    "So right now I'm just going to.",
    "Make little highlights along the lines.",
    "See how it goes.",
    "And then I'm going to reduce the Opacity later on.",
    "So it looks.",
    "So it doesn't ask Sean 'cause right now.",
    "It looks like the light is super strong and that extra super shiny.",
    "Hum.",
    "That Isn't so, it's probably going to react.",
    "To the light in real life.",
    "But again, it's all up to you without subjective.",
    "Just how to propose?",
    "I usually don't get the lines right the first time, so it takes a few tries to be dropped.",
    "So that others, do you think a world without days would be more disputed?",

    "I wouldn't be as happy as.",
    "Are you serious?",
    "We look at it.",
    "I hope this makes you happy using it is just so much better than going to be, but I highly recommend it.",
    "This is just this.",
    "This episode is yesterday's awareness about using the data cycle of all.",

    "You can actually make it for.",
    "By changing the cap to around here and thought that.",
    "There you go.",
    "And I just adjusted a bit, bring it down a notch.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Then This year Sit down.",

    "I guess the point is to talk about herself.",
    "Unless that's not the point, it just asking questions about whatever you like to talk about.",
    "That should be.",
    "The most fun experience for us all.",
    "OK, so as I mentioned before, the whites are too strong.",
    "The white highlights too strong, so I'm just gonna select all of them.",
    "And then go to Opacity and then 50%.",
    "Yeah.",
    "So that it makes it a bit more shiny.",
    "It's kind of my style.",
    "I like it.",
    "It looks more pleasing.",
    "Touch in Santee use because the days are so much better than toilet paper and they respond to use, you should definitely.",
    "No.",
    "Yeah so.",
    "I think I might add.",
    "Highlights here just so.",
    "So.",
    "No problem.",
    "Back up.",
    "Wait?",
    "Obviously, for consistency.",
    "Maybe 15.",
    "And then you can just.",
    "Select that.",
    "You have to.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Anymore questions.",
    "No.",

    "Um?",
    "Again, set up the mall.",
    "And then you can just mirror them.",
    "Use the eyedropper tool, which is I for the shortcut.",
    "I thought I thought.",
    "And then.",
    "Maybe a highlight?",
    "Yeah, I'm not quite sure what I'm doing, but.",
    "Thank you Lucas turning on.",
    "All right?",
    "My opinion.",
    "Allison.",
    "Make another one.",
    "Maybe again, should be for the blog brush.",
    "And then, since it's a smaller space, you can use the way then.",
    "Uh.",
    "So that's what about this color scheme?",
    "Do you personally find appealing?",
    "Do you not find it appealing?",
    "I try to stick with the colour scheme for my some news.",
    "Show you that.",
    "So this is the thumbnail for my for my stream for this episode of this so.",
    "I was maybe thinking of.",
    "Having like using it instead after what you can expect, the sign of peace will look like, but again isn't efforts.",
    "First team and I'm just making it up as I go along, so maybe not.",
    "No ask, you are better when you're at home or in New York.",

    "Um?",
    "So I guess that forces me to.",
    "Feel like working surrounded by a lot of people who are working all the time, but it's hard working people so that also helps be motivated to continue to work.",
    "I'm thinking whether I should add that highlight that makes sense.",
    "Let's keep it on the side for now.",
    "But yeah, I think I'm close to being done.",
    "Let me know if you.",
    "Remind me to add anything else.",
    "I think I should add.",
    "A magical ask what's the best advice you've ever received?",

    "If you put in 10,000 hours to.",
    "By working on some firm believer of that.",
    "So I kind of put in as many hours as I can and have been trying to do that ever since I decided what I wanted to do.",
    "But I wanted to pursue.",
    "So.",
    "Oh, I guess that's probably the best advice.",
