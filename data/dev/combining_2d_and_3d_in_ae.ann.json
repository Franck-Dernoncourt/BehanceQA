    "Oh, good morning everybody.",

    "I'm having Abrams.",
    "Welcome to another mograph breakfast.",
    "We're going to see we're going to see what we get into today.",
    "Arrange my windows.",
    "But yeah, uh, good to see you could see some folks hanging out with this morning.",
    "This is a thing we get into here all the time, every weekend.",
    "From 9:00 AM my time until later.",
    "I'm not sure how how long will go today we should go for a couple hours, but we'll see.",
    "If I get through all this stuff and it really depends on what stuff we get into.",
    "If you're hanging out with us last week, let's see, let's see.",
    "Hum.",
    "Oh, there we go now we're good now we're good if you're hanging over the last week we were working in cinema 4D light to try to make sort of a creepy fantasy gate thing for a weird gift series that I wanted to get into.",
    "Maybe we'll continue that work.",
    "Maybe yeah, let's do that.",
    "And what I wanted to do was try to composite some things together in there.",
    "So let's step back in and see where we are at.",
    "Yeah.",
    "So uh, hey good morning oh hey, who got hang it?",
    "We got Ahmed hanging out we got PD from Spain.",
    "Hello Gatineau zone Baker big like a pro hanging out.",
    "Hello hello everybody.",
    "Where you are in the world, those of us in the Greater Ottawa area are are enjoying some relaxing.",
    "Some relaxing COVID-19 restrictions.",
    "So that's always good.",
    "But in terms of what we were doing last time we were working in cinema 4D to make this kind of door gateway thing.",
    "And one of the things you know, I went ahead and skipped a lot of the texturing stuff.",
    "I wanted to kind of look like a toy, you know 'cause.",
    "I thought that was a funny idea, so that's where we kind of have this plasticky look.",
    "But I didn't do anything for the Sky, so the Sky is completely.",
    "We can't how's it go?",
    "And the Sky is completely open.",
    "You know why?",
    "Didn't put any things back there in the in the render so it's completely wide open for us to put all kinds of stuff back there.",
    "So in terms of what elements I kind of want to drop down here, let's see.",
    "What I've done in the?",
    "What I've done in the cinema 4D file is too messy.",
    "Camps here or what would have been laughs kind of.",
    "I removed the sconces.",
    "Just because I'm not sure yet.",
    "Not sure yet how really to composite that, but we have two lights there that are changing and intensity kind of way firewood.",
    "So we might animate some little fires to go here in there.",
    "I definitely want to do something, some kind of background up here, maybe some clouds.",
    "And maybe some like gentle gradient sweeps.",
    "Maybe not a gradient.",
    "Per say, right, but kind of a messy swished upgradient.",
    "So maybe will try to do that.",
    "I think that will be a fun.",
    "Exploration to get into, hopefully, and we'll see how it goes.",
    "I don't know about master Evan.",
    "I'm more like a more like a more like a chill buddy Evan, that's what that's where I'd rather be at.",
    "OK, so yeah, let's uhm.",
    "Dive in.",
    "It's all good people, people dip in and out of this program all the time.",
    "But yeah, let's let's see.",
    "Let's get into it.",
    "I woke up like half an hour ago, so things might be a little bit slow.",
    "So I want to put.",
    "Some kind of interesting gradient back there.",
    "I want it to kind of loop.",
    "In some way, the whole idea of this is to be a looping GIF.",
    "So if I want this to loop that I need to think of a few looping techniques.",
    "Uh, one of them that is very, very useful way to think about this stuff.",
    "It's kind of like Zoetrope style, like if you're able to rap a cylinder all the way around something right?",
    "If you created a comp that's kind of the same on the edges, then just offset it then.",
    "Everything will be fine so.",
    "I'll make one of those, so let's see.",
    "This is 1080 by 1080 so.",
    "I should be able to make something out of this.",
    "Start with.",
    "So the solid takes up the whole space blob like that.",
    "Have any other solids going on in here?",
    "And no, I want this one, yeah?",
    "So what I'm doing?",
    "Making sure these things are spaced out.",
    "So right now we definitely have a pattern.",
    "So if I were to.",
    "Simply start rotating this thing around.",
    "You know this end would match up with that end, right?",
    "If I were to do an offset of that, so we're going to be a comp too.",
    "I'm going to call this.",
    "Skyline Now I like a nice wide one.",
    "Technically we could have done this chopping this completely in half, but I kind of want more room to play with to give myself some variation in this thing and to make it less apparent when.",
    "When the rotation through happens, so I'm going to bring a skyline in here.",
    "OK.",
    "So as you can see, it's now sitting behind.",
    "That thing cool.",
    "And.",
    "I use the directional blur.",
    "The old directional blur.",
    "No blur.",
    "Uh.",
    "To fuzz these out.",
    "Goes high is 540 on this.",
    "There we go.",
    "I may come less Michael more I don't know.",
    "Here's a thing that you do need to do though is to put one out here, because these two are technically supposed to be the same thing.",
    "Good afternoon Huma corn hello hello, hope everyone is having a good time out here.",
    "That's what I think I'll do.",
    "Lower this one.",
    "'cause I want to create.",
    "Some variation out here maybe.",
    "Hello.",
    "I don't know.",
    "Yeah, now we should be able to seamlessly go from one side to the other.",
    "See how that works.",
    "But if we grab.",
    "Another version of the skyline.",
    "Put it over top of everything.",
    "Remove the tent from it.",
    "Move it like this.",
    "Is the sound not In Sync?",
    "Good question now.",
    "I don't know.",
    "Hard to say sometimes.",
    "Not sure what things other than my mouth should be making sound.",
    "But Looks pretty good, let's see.",
    "Now let's look fine come out of this, which are so this could be another Behance thing, I don't know.",
    "What if I should put on music while we're doing this?",
    "Would that be good?",
    "Maybe I'll look into that for tomorrow.",
    "Will figure out how to some kind of soundtrack so you're not.",
    "So that is a big delay.",
    "That's really weird.",
    "Don't don't know if that's that's on my side thing though.",
    "Everything everything is coming out of this, which are normal.",
    "So other than that nothing else I can really do about.",
    "About that Unfortunately.",
    "So, uh.",
    "5 seconds later, there is sound interesting.",
    "Huh?",
    "I wonder what that's all about?",
    "Yeah, I don't think I don't think refreshing is going to solve anything.",
    "That's, uh.",
    "Yeah.",
    "I don't know how to delay video to make it sync up.",
    "Would be funny though.",
    "I wonder if that is possible.",
    "Hey.",
    "Video delay Poop.",
    "The.",
    "He He Z.",
    "I don't know, so weird as as I say, all the things on my end look normal and good.",
    "I don't know it could be could be a Behance problem, it's been a lot of problems on the Internet recently, but a lot of YouTube problems, a lot of encoding problems, 8 seconds low.",
    "Well then I have no idea.",
    "So weird.",
    "OK well.",
    "Then we want to have some kind of like a weird creepy Castle back there.",
    "I don't think creepy castles really required at this point.",
    "But All of these should be aligned.",
    "Right, although we should be aligned, 'cause they're all.",
    "The same what I wanted to play with.",
    "Free tutorials and if it's free, you pay the iron price of your attention.",
    "Creepy trees, yeah, maybe some creepy trees.",
    "I think the general idea is good.",
    "Execution of idea, maybe not.",
    "Not being able to.",
    "Yeah, I am missing the little branches.",
    "You know, I'm I'm missing.",
    "Having little connective branches.",
    "And the floating leaves kind of make me unhappy.",
    "So I can try to cluster these up a little.",
    "Get the more clustered.",
    "See if that helps my disposition on the matter.",
    "I don't want to increase their density necessarily.",
    "Now they're real real shrubs.",
    "Shrub Life OK.",
    "Let's just go until nothing is disconnected.",
    "Go back to this.",
    "OK.",
    "Huh?",
    "Oh, how did the 1005 here too?",
    "Yeah, this is kind of working out actually, actually.",
    "I know it shouldn't shouldn't be surprised at it now.",
    "Something to say is I'm careful not to rotate.",
    "These Schreber Louise.",
    "Because.",
    "The way we have.",
    "Things undulating through them, right?",
    "If we were to rotate it at that undulation, flow wouldn't really make that much sense, and it wouldn't seem like they're all kind of getting affected by the same wind.",
    "So just a tip there, I suppose.",
    "Oh, really doesn't feel like we're coming out of the Woods on this thing.",
    "Oh boy.",
    "If you go out in the Woods today, don't go to a creepy door.",
    "If you go out in the Woods today.",
    "Uh.",
    "Turn, turn, turn, turn, turn turn turn.",
    "Don't don't, don't don't.",
    "OK, OK.",
    "Not really feeling lightning myself.",
    "Although that part was kind of funny.",
    "I like this.",
    "Mad is shiny, but I'll figure that out later.",
    "Walking through the Woods you encounter free plastic looking cats Castle.",
    "Funny.",
    "OK, I want to do some kind of torch fire and I know we beefed it earlier earlier episode.",
    "Did not go well.",
    "The fire truck.",
    "Oh well oh yards Oh my goodness so sorry everybody.",
    "Now I've seen a few.",
    "Guess the mat were smaller.",
    "Absolutely it would.",
    "Everything's about proportion.",
    "Is there anything I want to tweak?",
    "Would I like to return to cinema 4D?",
    "Um?",
    "Oh Sure, let's see what happens.",
    "I really like how the Sinner Where is sort of.",
    "Really able to.",
    "Time.",
    "You know the Sinner?",
    "Where does such a great job of pulling pulling things together?",
    "That that that that her mother is the welcome mat.",
    "Alright, I was trying to make a bool.",
    "I was trying to.",
    "I was trying to stick letters in the welcome mat.",
    "Ended up not being useful.",
    "But Uh.",
    "Could have them at curl up a bit in the breeze, who that's a very light Matt.",
    "I don't think that's a welcome mat you would want, but we can try it.",
    "Let's see if we can do that by warping this geometry.",
    "I've done it with extrude.",
    "Huh?",
    "So I would think, Oh yeah, I've got access to a bend.",
    "Why don't I just go ahead and bring that on, you know?",
    "But.",
    "Hey good morning to Timo Yeah it is starting to look like something.",
    "I think it's starting to look like something nice, you know.",
    "I think it's certainly go interesting places.",
    "OK, so 'cause right now we're looking at display we got.",
    "We got our garage shading lines going on.",
    "Let me just see here what I can do about so that's got segments.",
    "Close this bad boy segment situation.",
    "OK, that's got segments.",
    "Extrude caps",
    "I need are.",
    "Look Maybe this will help.",
    "I'm going to have to replace that.",
    "I don't think it can be.",
    "I don't want to extrude.",
    "Maybe I'll just show why 1st and then, then we'll get into it.",
    "So we got this extrude with this welcome mat.",
    "Welcome at I'm going to put do we have a band I gotta OK?",
    "OK.",
    "Click.",
    "Alright, attempt to bend the welcome mat.",
    "Ah.",
    "Yeah, that's not going to.",
    "Uh-huh Yeah, the geometry it is de forming.",
    "Hold on, hold on.",
    "Hold on step one, uh.",
    "File new project.",
    "That thing was too cluttered.",
    "I was confusing myself.",
    "Let's see, I'm gonna make us make us this.",
