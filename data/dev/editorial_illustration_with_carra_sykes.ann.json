    "Like your computer, things will have to work.",
    "Won't have to work as hard when like.",

    "But Uhm, I probably be finishing this off screen.",
    "Maybe not today, but.",
    "Sometime soon, because we're we've got to finish up the newspaper.",
    "We have to finish up the newspaper.",
    "Uh, but before the end of the month, because we will be printing them.",

    "Because.",

    "It might be that order.",
    "They run through like this, cyan, magenta, yellow and black.",
    "I think black is the last layer 'cause it's the darkest.",
    "And it would make sense to print that.",
    "Hum.",
    "So sometimes we have to deal with something called intensity, so if there's too much of one color like and you get a buildup of over, I think it's my density.",
    "I'm allowed to have is 225.",
    "You can see this in Photoshop.",
    "Actually I'll show you.",

    "If you look right here.",
    "At this this is the.",
    "Total ink if this is above 225, it might cause an issue with printing and cause it to like to smear the ink an like mess up all the all the papers so I have to make sure that this color.",
    "Is under 225 so I have to mess with like selective color and I have to mess with all that stuff in order to make it.",
    "Not.",
    "Get all over the place, but that's part of the process that takes like the longest with when I'm working on photo shop and dealing with.",
    "Dealing with that part of the process of the newspaper, and that was a learning curve.",
    "So now like the first time I did the first newspaper I did it took me like almost like 40 hours to complete.",
    "Then takes about.",
    "For me, it takes about.",
    "Like an average of 25 to 30 hours on each paper to complete them, 'cause I have to do new layouts for all the pages and decide how creatively we're going to illustrate each article that to read the articles and then after reading them I have to decide how I'm going to illustrate them.",
    "So it's quite the process, but it.",
    "Is so fun.",
    "There's a lot of work.",
    "But up but yeah.",
    "So.",
    "That's kind of like a behind the scenes look at that process.",
    "Um?",
    "I think.",
    "It's nice because a lot of my work is digital and I never really got to see it.",
    "Um?",
    "Printed 'cause you know so often these days.",
