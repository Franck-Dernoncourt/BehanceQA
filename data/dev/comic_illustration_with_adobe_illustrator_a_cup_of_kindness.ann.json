    "I'm almost done with my line art on this comic, which is nice.",
    "Uh, many go back and so this is the opening of the comic I've got my 2 characters.",
    "They're starting their day with a Cup of kindness.",
    "And then these are the kind of the good deeds that they're going through.",
    "We're starting with cleaning up the environment in there, helping this granny bear cross the road, coconuts carrying her groceries.",
    "Then they're doing donations and then this will be the final one where they kind of reflect on how good it makes them feel to help out others.",
    "So what I'm doing right now is just finishing up these this last kind of donation panel, and then I'll be on this one and then I'll be on colors, so hopefully that will go pretty quickly to color and this one won't be too bad.",
    "These characters are Browns, there are very few colors.",
    "I think the most colors is with coconut.",
    "She's got a white body and orange cap, and then she's got the stripes on her tail.",
    "Momo is really just about three colors.",
    "Line art, her body color, which is kind of like a caramel Brown.",
    "Busy day busy is good, busy is definitely good.",
    "Getting stuff done.",
    "So on the colour should go pretty equally on this one.",
    "I got my my groups here set up and I'm just getting ready to open it right here.",
    "It's gonna be the back of her head.",
    "Groups yourself makes it easier for me to there we go.",
    "Portfolio refreshed nice.",
    "And since I have her group like this, I can move her around.",
    "And kind of small.",
    "Kind of play around with the characters in the frame a little bit.",
    "Maybe I can just put them.",
    "Now these are right there for you.",
    "Get her body and her tail and she's holding onto that box of food.",
    "And I kinda want her.",
    "What?",
    "And she said, how bad is bad?",
    "I need her foot like she's kind of.",
    "He said she said too much booty.",
    "Alright, we gotta turn the booty a little bit.",
    "This team that we've just kind of.",
    "Bring it down all the boards.",
    "That's a little bit more reasonable.",
    "And so she's that tiny.",
    "This set of stripes.",
    "Around her sale.",
    "And opportunity.",
    "Do you have a color palette saved in Swatch is for each character I.",
    "I should, I don't, but I generally know about the same.",
    "I have this same line color that I go to and from what I go through is let me just let me open up one of my previous comics and show.",
    "Adventure that's a good one.",
    "Alright, so here is my one from Tuesday.",
    "And so you can't really see it 'cause it's hidden behind.",
    "This is my color palette that I work from an how I go through it is I kind of I start with my line art color, which is usually either Brown or dark blue and then I kind of go through here and pick different palettes and kind of just put together several different colors that I like and then I'll go through here and Mike.",
    "Here is her orange an I'll pick that out.",
    "And then I'll kind of follow a line down and build my pallets that way from the colours that I'll pick.",
    "And once I settle on the colors that I want for the characters, I'll go in and I'll come.",
    "So this is kind of how I started.",
    "I did my regular sketch and then I went through an.",
    "I did just some lining and trying to layout where everything was going to be and this is a big process of sketching and kind of just layout and trying to rap the design around the Cup and I was really happy that I tried it and originally this is a teacup and then like towards the end I got the idea to actually make it a measuring Cup so.",
    "That's how the final design came to be with the measuring Cup here.",
    "I was really happy with how it turned out.",
    "I pushed out of my comfort zone and.",
    "Really tried to, you know, kind of get it.",
    "Get it into a cohesive design and so that then is going to become a real life.",
    "Holographic sticker and it's going to be printed all white on the holographic sticker an I think it'll turn out.",
    "Really cool.",
    "I confirm that they can do that and the mock up pretty much looks exactly like this, so I'm excited to see it and but yeah, so those will be arriving soon.",
    "But anyway, bouncing off of this I thought it would be neat to have a comic kind of expounding on that.",
    "Idea of starting every day with a Cup of kindness.",
    "So this is my initial sketch Phase I start everything out with a very, very rough sketch, just to kind of look at layout and get an idea of what I want to put down on the page and.",
    "I will bite you like Italian.",
    "But but you know, it's it was I was really excited about it.",
    "It's going to be.",
    "I've never done a holo sticker and so.",
    "I really want to experiment around with different materials and laminates and sticker basis, so I mean not just the traditional.",
    "Oh Speaking of stickers I did I want to show a follow up.",
    "I don't believe I've shown these on stream here before, but I designed these on stream a couple weeks ago.",
    "Is on a Saturday.",
    "I went through the setup of the sticker cutline files for these guys an this is the final product of what I designed that day and they turned out really cute and you can see my cutlines their own that well.",
    "I don't know if you can see my couplings.",
    "I don't know if you can actually there there, I promise.",
    "Turned out so well and say I just wanted to show kind of the final product after.",
    "After that, that stream on making these an if you want to see that replay it's in my video section.",
    "It was on a Saturday and I think it was like.",
    "Two or three weeks ago, but yeah, so that was something I've been meaning to show that I keep forgetting on.",
    "But yeah, so let's get to some comments from here.",
    "So what I have to start is I usually.",
    "And I met this out last night.",
    "I like to get a general layout of what I'm doing.",
    "'cause sometimes my layouts are continuous.",
    "They kind of flow down the page and then I have to think about how I'm going to cut them up later for things like Instagram in different platforms where I post these comics, like for example Instagram has the they have two aspect ratios, they have a square and then they have the slightly taller portrait.",
    "But you can only fit so many frames within that size.",
    "So if you have a longer comic you have to utilize their swipe.",
    "And those 10 frames there, so that's what I usually do.",
    "I'm usually thinking about OK, I've got 10 frames and technically 9 because I always like to put like just like information on the comic got in the last frame.",
    "Or sometimes I like to do a title card.",
    "So if I'm doing a title card, I gotta keep that in mind too.",
    "But in this case it's going to be actually pretty simple.",
    "Probably going to end up being.",
    "I might I might draw this last panel a little bit more detailed like there are in a house or their in their home, and I have all the supporting kind of environment stuff here, but this I think I'm going to keep one frame even though on the original comic I have the words.",
    "Cut up over here.",
    "This is just my notes for myself on what these little frames are going to be, so the comic is going to go like this.",
    "I've got the set up with them having your Cup of kindness and then they go throughout the day doing different good deeds like this one.",
    "I usually have this set on Hue, saturation, balance an.",
    "I'll go in and edit from there depending on the situation, but once I get those colors, I'll usually add them to.",
    "The Swatch is so I don't lose them.",
    "But sometimes it really depends because generally there are about the same.",
    "She's kind of a caramel color and purple color in her body color always the same.",
    "So and then she has this kind of offset Brown color, which is right here.",
    "So it's not really.",
    "I should do that and make it easier on myself, but I don't.",
    "I like to kind of choose the colors for each illustration.",
    "Yeah, I like that a lot.",
    "I mean it.",
    "I like having a neither of warm or cool tent to the line art depending on what is being depicted, uhm.",
    "If I'm doing like nature scenes an like, the timing of the comic isn't like summer or, you know, kind of a warmer season of a client.",
    "I'll pick those colors, but if I've got a like something in the winter, I'll pick the purple colors and just kind of work that in actually have let me show I can bring up one I know.",
    "Just going to do it this way 'cause I can pick it easier and see it easier on the bigger screen.",
    "Uh, back around Christmas time.",
    "Why you so much faster now windows?",
    "Yeah, exactly exactly.",
    "And I just I kind of like to.",
    "I feel like if I if I'm always picking on the same palette, I don't want him just like the lighting situation in this one.",
    "I was really excited to work on that one.",
    "An those colors I remember I was picking a little bit off of what was on here and I actually didn't end up adding those to my doc.",
    "I should have but.",
    "Where is.",
    "Going to camp.",
    "2 Atlas Brown.",
    "I actually trend towards Brown locked.",
    "Snow Angels I looked, I did that one in Brown because Pudges Brown.",
    "At this one was blue.",
    "Ignore.",
    "So this one.",
    "He was in wintertime snowy colors.",
    "And I had.",
    "I had my character interacting with the snowman, which is coming to life, but not when she looked at it so.",
    "Kind of like.",
    "I I get a lot of inspiration from Calvin and Hobbes, and I grew up reading those.",
    "I grew up reading Garfield and far side and a lot of different ones like that so.",
    "It's kind of where I get my joke inspiration from when I do a funny comic like that, but yeah, this is one and I kind of did the same thing.",
    "You can see it over here.",
    "Here's my line art color and then I kind of preceded down and built up my colors there.",
    "I know that she's orange, so I needed some oranges, but mostly I was going to be dealing with kind of cooler Purples and Blues and she's got a warmer tint to her body color right here, which I did actually save.",
    "And he looked up here.",
    "You can see it's just a version of her.",
    "Per cap color.",
    "How long does it take to learn comic design?",
    "I think a while an you learn a lot by doing.",
    "I started.",
    "I started trying to do comics around 2010 an I started and stopped a lot and that was because I didn't have the speed.",
    "I didn't have the skills that I wanted an I couldn't get the stories out in the way that in the manner that I wanted, so I got frustrated.",
    "I'd start and I'd stop and then I started doing daily paintings and that helped me advance my skills and also get quicker.",
    "So I mean a lot of learning is in the doing, at least for me.",
    "I also read a lot.",
    "Is there picking up trash and cleaning up the environment?",
    "This one is there helping an older character across the road and coconuts carrying her groceries.",
    "And then this one is going to be there going to take some donations to food bank.",
    "And then at the end I'm going to have another line right here.",
    "And then I'm going to have a coconut reflecting on how good it made her feel to do that.",
    "Could you know, D.",
    "For other people so?",
    "So cheap here, so that's the that's the.",
    "The story line in this comic an let's just get to drawing then.",
    "And so OK.",
    "The first thing I do is I drop down the transparency of my sketch and it's just so I can still have a guideline and.",
    "Then I go over the top in mine it.",
    "Anything goes down a little bit.",
    "And I work in two layers.",
    "I've got my sketch stuff on one layer and then I have the the actual lining art and final work on the second layer.",
    "So.",
    "It helps me keep things organized in illustrator.",
    "Thank you senator.",
    "Keep all.",
    "I just saw that the hand stuff.",
    "Posted posted this stream in their stories and I love the comic.",
    "They said it was the spring, as normal, cheap and that was one of the ones that was actually difficult for me because it was a continuous comic, except for the first 2 frames because it has the character walking down through different areas and then coming to another character.",
    "And kind of like a Meadow Grove at the bottom so that one was different difficult when in AM.",
    "I was really excited too.",
    "To see that one through.",
    "If you have any questions about the the tools I'm using right now, I'm using the blob brush and I use that to do on my lining.",
    "After I have everything set up with the blob brush as far as my lines I go through and I use the pencil tool to do my color fills.",
    "And.",
    "Yes.",
    "My hand is not to wind up yet today.",
    "So let's go ahead and just.",
    "The mental model.",
    "What is my point size here?",
    "Not sure I like it too much.",
    "Yes, I kind of want to move my Contacts at this point.",
    "Some of the shortcuts I use all the time.",
    "I use the bracket, the bracket keys.",
    "To, uh, do my point size of my pin up and down.",
    "I also use those same keys to send a group forward and backward in.",
    "In my layer and I use.",
    "You know I don't use a lot of layers, but my equivalent of layers in illustrator is kind of like groups and I kind of keep a running.",
    "Just to kind of check on where all of them are.",
    "'cause I usually group characters together.",
    "Then I group environment pieces, foreground, middle ground background.",
    "So if I want to bring something forward, if I want to hide something behind like a Hill or something, I can do that easily 'cause I just have that character, their line art and their color all in one group.",
    "That helps me, especially when I'm doing my daily illustrations.",
    "And I've got you know, more elaborate scenes that I'm working on.",
    "I kind of want to have her smiling, an momo smiling, so keep that in mind.",
    "This is going to be a pretty bare frame.",
    "But there are probably move that around, so that's another thing I like to group objects as well, because if I want to change how they're holding something, if I figured out I have not drawn it right, I can just move it around and and keep track of it there as opposed to having a bunch of.",
    "There are several really good books that let me just grab them right here that I relied on to help me learn the basics.",
    "There by Scott McCloud hold on a second let me put my little bugs back in.",
    "OK, here we go.",
    "All right?",
    "So I highly recommend both of these guys.",
    "I read making comics first.",
    "This is the nuts and bolts.",
    "This is like the tools you use.",
    "This is how to set up and understand panels how to.",
    "I always have trouble describing this like bridging the gap between frames, that type of thing, and this is more understanding the iconography and you know what things mean in comics and how different comics are.",
    "You know, place on a scale of visual versus words versus you know kind of abstract.",
    "I mean they're both very good textbooks if you want to learn comics and take it, you know, pretty deep dive, he has another one which is reinventing comics and I think 1/4 one.",
    "Oh yeah, no.",
    "He's so good an I'm so glad I picked up those copies I had.",
    "I had had them on PDF, and my iPad Anet through something.",
    "It's just different when you can actually see it and read it, and you know I like to do a lot of bookmarks and you know, I like to highlight things.",
    "I didn't highlight this because of course it you know.",
    "Roominess, but that's another thing that it's organized, like a graphic novel, and you know, they say if you want to do it, you've got to immerse yourself in the art form.",
    "And this is immersing yourself in the art for machine learning.",
    "I've been trying to change my initial sketch color in digital drawing since I tend to use black and can't see on the original details, which kind of yeah, night, yeah that that's what I start in black-and-white just because it's easiest and then I I dropped my sketches down pretty low like these are all 30% or less and like what I did yesterday.",
    "This is my initial sketch for this and it got to be such a mess and so I was, you know, taking out and pasting in different things.",
    "You know to get to where I could actually see the design that I was drawing.",
    "Again, an yeah, it can get really, really, really messy sometimes.",
    "Um?",
    "Right, yeah, like here's another messy one.",
    "This was Tuesdays challenge stream was seen study from Jurassic Park.",
    "And my sketch layer here was kind of messy, but the line art layer I had divided up into these are the foreground elements, middle ground background.",
    "But I had everything drawn completely on each level.",
    "Like here we go in here.",
    "Let me go here this guy.",
    "So if you look here, I've got.",
    "He still drawn completely?",
    "I didn't go in and race anybody because I was wondering if I would use this someplace else.",
    "Is a stand alone.",
    "So I wanted to keep these characters.",
    "But yeah, all the lineart going all over each other was a mess.",
    "How can I get those books?",
    "They are available on.",
    "Let me go ahead and grab the Amazon links here for you.",
    "I sent a month retraining my knowledge of web coding, hit the wrong button on the hosting dashboard, went up with WordPress template compound.",
    "Oh no.",
    "Oh, thank you so much, Susan.",
    "For now, rejected owed for foreigners in light room to store.",
    "To pick so nice.",
    "That's clever.",
    "That when I redid My Portfolio I was I was stressing out alot about how to 'cause I had literally not touched it for years and I was kind of really stressing out about what to put in it and how to tell a story and how to kind of convey the work that I wanted to do and it just it's fun but kind of the starting is a little bit intimidating.",
    "Let me grab those Amazon links really quick.",
    "Amazon.",
    "You can also get these actor Kindle Versions, an ebook versions as well.",
    "Scott Making comics reinventing comics.",
    "A bunch of shapes that.",
    "I just kind of sitting out there and.",
    "And that's another thing I'll oftentimes go in and.",
    "I want to have.",
    "This cat showed their hearts in here, just lots of them and what I'm going to do because he's hearts are inside the Carpenters.",
    "Gonna Drop This guy down here.",
    "Just do that and made it back.",
    "So now we have a Cup full of hearts.",
    "Kind of bugging so I didn't think of using that comic either.",
    "I kind of want to use it.",
    "On exchange in the future.",
    "Oh shoot well.",
    "No, I'm not going to keep that separate.",
    "Let's go out to my upper layer is paste that.",
    "No.",
    "I checked it out so it's alright, I can just I can just group.",
    "Only jadion right needs to breathe.",
    "And then.",
    "The real cat that this is based off of has these shoulder.",
    "I look at them as patches 'cause she's got an orange one and a Brown one, but there it's pretty symmetrical and it's really interesting to see when she walks, because if you're like, here's here's her head.",
    "She's walking, there's men.",
    "Here's her body.",
    "So she's got the patches like this and it's just it's like she's wearing a Cape and I kind of wanted to.",
    "Work that into her character, but I didn't want to make it too difficult for me to draw because I'd be drawing this over and over and over again an if I have one side orange and one side Brown, I'd be like always stressing over which side is which.",
    "An did I ask?",
    "did I pick writer and I always putting the Orange Patch on her Brown Patch side in that type of deal?",
    "So that's one where I kind of decided to simplify.",
    "But still keep that that real cue from the the actual cat.",
    "She also has this orange cat.",
    "And that is it's not all orange, but it's kind of like she's a mixed tabby, so she's got, you know, bits and pieces of everything.",
    "But if I blur my eyes and kind of look to see what it averages out to it, it averages out to a pretty vibrant orange.",
    "And so that's why I decided to give her that orange cap on her head.",
    "And it does kind of cross under her eyes like that.",
    "That is a little bit on Coco's character design moment sheet is actually about the same, so I want to keep you know what I'm just going to group.",
    "I'm gonna draw Moe and I'm going to group them later.",
    "I'll keep the two characters separate inside this group.",
    "Normal was about the same deal.",
    "She is a mixed was annexed Abby and she kind of averaged out to this caramel browned and she of course had the four White Sox.",
    "So I wanted to keep that as one of her main distinguishing features.",
    "and I always loved how her.",
    "Her forehead stripes were very striking.",
    "She had dumb.",
    "She had like almost black eyeliner around her eyes.",
    "That's what it looked like, and, um, very striking.",
    "I was almost certain that he had had a four point, I guess.",
    "The actual first publication was the understanding comics that was in 90 four and this is the second book in the series which is like around 2006.",
    "But this is you don't need to read them in order of publication.",
    "I don't think I dove into the making comics first an I was absolutely fine.",
    "Let me go ahead and grab that so I didn't want to tweet it.",
    "I just know I didn't want to tweet it.",
    "I just want nothing.",
    "OK.",
    "How do you make it so difficult for me to share links?",
    "Amazon.",
    "I got it.",
    "There's a book.",
    "So frustrating is prepress jobs for 12 and rethink what I wanted to present.",
    "Oh that's 12 years.",
    "Oh wow.",
    "So kind of like moving.",
    "Moving industry is kinda.",
    "Let me go over here.",
    "You're welcome to Basel.",
    "Those are a great one to start of- if you just kind of want to learn, you don't know what to do.",
    "Fantastic resources, there's also a lot of great resources on YouTube.",
    "And you know a lot of things.",
    "You know, general art.",
    "Tutorials and you know, studying all the fundamentals all work into comics, like when you're drawing is senior.",
    "Working with composition, all of those areas if you concentrate on one or the other, they will help your comic design and like perspective.",
    "If you're drawing a lot of scenes and cities or rooms, you really need to press on that.",
    "You know perspective, practice and learn how to draw things in a room so it's believable because when people are reading your comics they have you have like seconds.",
    "If that milliseconds to communicate locations, an moods an you know.",
    "Details that weren't will inform the joke you're trying to make.",
    "If you're making funny comics so you know the fundamentals, it really you know.",
    "If I could suggest anything I would do that as well as also studying story Anne, how to there are a lot of great books on story craft.",
    "I have quite a few over here too.",
    "Let me grab one.",
    "This one this is actually based on save the cat rights and novel.",
    "This is an offshoot of the original save the cats book which was for script writing in screen writing, but this applies all of these concepts apply to, especially if you're writing the long form comics.",
    "You need to have a story.",
    "It's understandable that goes some place, and so I've been studying and reading these.",
    "You know 'cause If you're making comics, you've got to have those two married together.",
    "Well story and art.",
    "I made templates for boxes anninos who printed on didn't get to do much in the design.",
    "However, I cleaned up every once in FO no.",
    "Oh, how frustrating.",
    "And that reminds me of I worked in print design a little bit, and sometimes you know we get.",
    "This is just a small, you know, small business printer is a large format.",
    "They did like Rapson.",
    "Christmas cards that type of stuff in a small product design an oftentimes we would get, you know, a client that would insist that they had vector files that they had high resolution photos and you know so many times.",
    "I would open up the vector file an there would just be a JPEG that had been dropped into the vector file.",
    "Forehead stripes And.",
    "But on on the average she was a Brown Patch tabby, and so those are the details I decided to keep for her.",
    "And that makes it easy for me to draw and consistently draw this character.",
    "And as I increase my Postman steps.",
    "Let's actually go into our group.",
    "There we go.",
    "As I increase my posting schedule.",
    "You know that'll.",
    "That's something that you know I I didn't really give enough thought too when I originally started doing comics.",
    "I am actually started and stopped quite a bit over the years and.",
    "Yeah, that's what I wanna do.",
    "Anna, I remember originally Hindu is how are you?",
    "Welcome to the stream.",
    "If you have any questions, feel free to ask.",
    "All about the tools I'm using or card making more products in general, that's a little bit too rotund.",
    "Belly for membership.",
    "There we go.",
    "Who's your body mind?",
    "But I remember starting, you know I did my first real effort like in 2010 and ask how I'm gonna post, you know, three comics a week and I just yeah, no way no way.",
    "I had no idea it took me a week to make one.",
    "Now at that point I was using keyboard and mouse and I didn't.",
    "I didn't have any anywhere near the speed drawing speed that I do now and so that was, you know.",
    "Very much an example of biting off more than you can chew, and it's important to keep that in mind if you're considering starting a comic you know, be aware of your capabilities and you know when you're planning your schedule when you're making these commitments to make these posts.",
    "Be mindful of the work and you know.",
    "Try it out a little bit before you start a firm posting schedule an you can always adjust it.",
    "I mean no one says that once you say you're only you're posting on Tuesday, you can't change it from Tuesday.",
    "That's silly.",
    "What I discovered that I like to do is I'll get used to the schedule that I picked.",
    "So like originally for me, it was once a week and then I was like, OK I I feel like I can do two times a week now and now I'm to the point where I'm pretty confident I can get three and I just need to.",
    "I need to settle on the timing of that because I kind of have an awkward timing, a lot of a lot of Web Comics are Monday, Wednesday, Friday or Tuesday Thursday, and you know that type of deal, but i'ma Tuesday Friday an then?",
    "So where's the other day?",
    "and I thought originally I would put it on Sunday, but I'm still 'cause I don't really see a lot of Web comics updating on Sunday and they think of it, but.",
    "Search just something to think about if you're looking into web comics.",
    "If you're interested in in publishing your own.",
    "And also, you know, as with anything, if you're interested in making comics, you gotta read 'em.",
    "You gotta find your favorites.",
    "You gotta immerse yourself in the.",
    "In the industry.",
    "Do an upside down heart.",
    "Let's do a heart that's kind of an inside.",
    "I can erase this back part now.",
    "Hello, welcome back Anna.",
    "How are you doing today?",
    "Like a little fair, I've got these hearts pretty much together.",
    "Alright, let's go back in one level and let's make normal shitholes pickup.",
    "Bakers 700 tail planter little part.",
    "Like if I'm doing the camera angle like from above or something, I don't usually do I like to kind of focus that focus on that.",
    "For Tuesdays.",
    "I've done a couple of seen studies for the last two of 'em.",
    "Which were a lot of fun, so this next Tuesday will probably be something different than that.",
    "I also do product design.",
    "I did some sticker designs on a stream once.",
    "So, but every Thursday is more comics, so if you're interested in comics stuff, definitely check out the Thursday streams, because that's when I put these together for my posts on Friday.",
    "OK, I can.",
    "Actually, I think.",
    "I think I'm at the stage where I can cut that out and.",
    "Brightness over here.",
    "Move it over Young.",
    "So I don't need that anymore.",
    "I also can take coconut some.",
    "Estimated.",
    "It's out there.",
    "Since I am pretty confident this is where moment she's going to be in the go ahead and just.",
    "There is this.",
    "What?",
    "All right?",
    "You welcome to Faizal.",
    "I hope you have a great rest of your Thursday.",
    "Here is the week on that's what I wanna know.",
    "It was Monday, just.",
    "A couple of days ago.",
    "All right, so we've got through donation center.",
    "We've got you guys are girls.",
    "You're taking your canned foods.",
    "I'm going to let see.",
    "Kind of normal too.",
    "A little bit more.",
    "I'm going to have to.",
    "I'm going to do is.",
    "I'm going to come back here and I'm going to swoop in over here and I'm going to select some of this because I'm going to make that a different language.",
    "I wanna put that and make sure it's all happy and ready to be colored a different color.",
    "And then these guys would be regular.",
    "Just wanna put that maybe on Earth.",
    "Maybe one step, just push it back a little bit.",
    "Sorry, that was done.",
    "Let's hit save.",
    "This my first time watching really like it when we use the blob brush.",
    "How's it different mental regular brush?",
    "Alright, so.",
    "The blob brush.",
    "The big difference between that and the paintbrush.",
    "The blob brush you got here, let me make this bigger.",
    "Let's make it a lot bigger.",
    "Apparently I was operating in like 1 point.",
    "Who settings?",
    "There we go.",
    "Um?",
    "All right, so the big difference is the blob brush creates Phil.",
    "So this is not a stroke, it was, it is.",
    "It's a Phil though.",
    "So like when you're looking at this is this creates a stroke that you can then apply any different style too.",
    "You can do a lot of different things with it.",
    "You can edit the you can edit the width of it using the with editing tool.",
    "Where are you?",
    "We are over here, I think.",
    "No.",
    "He's always get pushed around.",
    "I'm always losing certain tools.",
    "It gets under this one.",
    "Has a race right now.",
    "Mr blunders here.",
    "What's the life paint tool?",
    "Oh Gosh.",
    "To do that, it's control shift.",
    "I think a key.",
    "Nope, Nope.",
    "Nope.",
    "There we go to get rid of that.",
    "Um, let's see.",
    "Here is that down.",
    "With tool here we go.",
    "It's hidden under my thumb, so using this you can.",
    "He kind of fake what's going on here, but the main difference is this creates a fill.",
    "This creates a stroke and I like this for.",
    "Just for sketching, it feels more natural to me.",
    "And it, uhm?",
    "I do it generally for outlines an my line art, but I also do, uhm.",
    "Here, and he actually just come into here and show this is a final, so I'll use the blob brush to create this line art.",
    "Also sometimes use it to help with the coloring.",
    "So for example, these little lips, these little areas in the ears that's so small I might just come in with the blob brush inches, draw a little switch right there and for the shadowing there.",
    "Otherwise I'll come in with the pencil tool and raw fills like I did with the.",
    "With the coloring in the major areas back here, I'll just fill it in with the pencil tool an I'll follow around my line art.",
    "And then do it that way.",
    "But yeah, maybe the difference is an, you know there are a lot of I've seen some comic artists that use the.",
    "Use the brush tool and then they'll apply a really cool brush to it.",
    "That's like reminiscent of a paintbrush, or just has that kind of rough edge of oven acrylic brush, or like a pentel brush pen.",
    "But for my my style I like the Clean Softlines 'cause all my characters are kind of soft and squishy.",
    "So I want the lines to reflect that as well.",
    "And it it's just it's kind of a matter.",
    "I think of preference in the tool that you're used to.",
    "I feel that for myself this is closer.",
    "This bridges the gap of me drawing on paper with a pencil and a brush a little bit easier than the than the regular brush tool.",
    "An again I don't use.",
    "I don't apply a lot of the brushes and use that unless for very specific purpose.",
    "Like if I'm distressing in area or.",
    "I'm applying a texture all come in.",
    "I'll use the brush.",
    "All users watch Phil.",
    "But this, if you have a tablet and you're able to do pressure sensitivity stuff, I definitely would suggest giving it a try, because it it really changed the way I worked and how fast I was when I adopted using the bloggers tool I tried to use the web tool and I still require more practice, yet no, it's a It's a tricky one.",
    "If you're looking at, let's actually let's make the.",
    "Something we can see here.",
    "Let's just make this ridiculous.",
    "All right?",
    "One of the big things that really tweaked me when I was initially using it was, you know, editing this and dragging it along here, because if there were a lot of points in the, you know the line was rough.",
    "It kind of it got a little wonky and you know of course adding multiple points along the along the stroke in editing it.",
    "That way it does take a lot, but it was an indispensable tool for me when I was working with just keyboard and mouse.",
    "Because I wanted that line variation, I didn't want to have just single with lines.",
    "I wanted to have the ability to control that.",
    "And so yeah, it was, you know.",
    "Trial by fire, I guess.",
    "Figuring out how to do all that good stuff, but it's a great tool to have and I remember the version.",
    "I think it was CS5 or CS 5.5 that they came out with that because I've I was on 2 for the longest time and I don't believe it had the width tool and the switch to five.",
    "Brought that, and I think that brought the pattern tool to an.",
    "I was so excited about those features.",
    "'cause that was something I really wanted to incorporate.",
    "Um?",
    "Alright, so I hope that answers your question.",
    "Get her.",
    "No.",
    "I was doing it raining outside of my group.",
    "Right there we go.",
    "I'm gonna have her.",
    "Maybe I'm going to help her with a little trash proceeding.",
    "And maybe she'll have her back right here.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Kinda wanna have this.",
    "Just the edge of this sound.",
    "Yes, laughing over here.",
    "And since this is being line of the, I might tip this.",
    "I might tip this.",
    "Can a little bit.",
    "Z always drop retail in there and you need to fix your ear after a little bit.",
    "And on the website right now, I love you are in place.",
    "All Diana.",
    "Thank you so much.",
    "Thank you.",
    "I'm glad you like it.",
    "I've been, I've been kind of Gung Ho on stickers lately, um.",
    "Just because, well, I mean, I love stickers an I stick 'em on everything and it's just it's so much fun to design them and I'm eventually going to figure out how to get them in packs you can actually use on the phone.",
    "That's like the next step and I want to do packs for.",
    "All of the characters, like the like these sheets right here.",
    "I've done, I've got, um.",
    "The proofs for the first set and then I've gotta punch the pug set that I finished and.",
    "I mean I've made.",
    "I've made a lot of individual coconut in moment sheet stickers, but I'd really like to do a pack like an emotive pack like that for them.",
    "And of course all of the others happy.",
    "I mean, I feel bad 'cause I have like I have a mini set of three for happy.",
    "I have the line work, I just haven't finished it and made him.",
    "I really kind of need to make a happy paper.",
    "Step down instead.",
    "But it's just kind of addictive and I use them everywhere.",
    "I mean people using planners and you know that some of the things I think about when I'm making them.",
    "And like, well where do I see this design?",
    "You know, being really useful.",
    "'cause like I did one where pudges.",
    "He's has a spot, then he's going tap and so you know that could be my thought.",
    "There was like maybe an Instagram sticker for, you know, tack right here for a new post.",
    "Or if you're using it in your Journal or your planner, he could be pointing to an important day or something like that so.",
    "It's really fun for me to go through and think about those and design, and it seems like you know.",
    "I have a little bit of a block.",
    "When I start up.",
    "But once I get rolling 'cause like on the punch set, I was struggling to find I was making a list just kind of doing the brain dump of all the different, you know, happy, sad, high by all the different kind of emotions or whatever I could potentially do an I ended up.",
    "Can if you have anymore like you know, if you have specific things regarding the blob Russian, how I how I work or anything else, just go ahead and Drop it in chat and I will do my best to help.",
    "Um?",
    "Don't set the scene before I do this 'cause she's gonna be there.",
    "Kinda do in her little for little flicks.",
    "Up We'll just start with less.",
    "Oh, I hope you like it, Kim.",
    "It really is a fun too.",
    "I mean it, it takes, uh oh, here, let me actually let me let me qualify this here a little bit.",
    "These are my settings for the blob brush up I have keep selected unchecked an I have merge only with selection checked and what that allows me to do is in the type of drawing I do like I'm often creating a lot of textures grass is.",
    "Things that require me to do a lot of strokes in quick succession.",
    "An if I had both of these checks to I would be creating a gigantic single shape that is Uneditable.",
    "So I would suggest keeping a no uncheck that, so at least until you get the hang of the tool and how you're going to work with it and how you want to use it.",
    "I would keep that unchecked so your strokes are our individual.",
    "Unless of course you don't want them to be, in which case this merge only with selection is your bro.",
    "He that one let's you select what you want to edit and then whatever stroke you add will be merged with that automatically.",
    "Um?",
    "And I also do.",
    "Here I go on the setting.",
    "I keep it kind of in the middle.",
    "I compare this a lot to the lazy Mizumi Plugin and photo shop.",
    "This gives you mines a little bit of smoothing or a lot of smoothing, but play around with those settings and see how much a little or a lot that you like and 'cause I can really kind of.",
    "It's a little bit of hand studying, you know if you're.",
    "The IT is kind of for me.",
    "It's pretty critical that I have that.",
    "'cause it just, you know, it just helps, especially if you know you're working on tablet, your hands sweaty.",
    "You know you're not exactly getting the perfect line.",
    "That will help you get it.",
    "And then play around with these settings as well.",
    "Make sure you have this set to pressure and that will give you the nice stroke with variation when you press on your tablet and play around with these settings, you can do a lot of fun things with these two guys.",
    "You can effectively turn this into a calligraphy pen if you want to try your hand at lettering and do all sorts of neat stuff just by editing that, making it like a chisel tip for.",
    "You know what have you?",
    "So there are, you know, within that one dialog box there a lot of fun things that you can do.",
    "But yeah, it's it's a pretty indispensable tool for me.",
    "And you know, I can kind of.",
    "I got my tablet around 2016.",
    "And in my first few drawings, I can see that I was still trying to draw, oh.",
    "I am getting a little bit of.",
    "Have no comeback.",
    "Come on.",
    "Oh, don't die any.",
    "Come on, come back.",
    "Oh is it coming back?",
    "Or we can.",
    "Over back, yeah I'm back.",
    "Oh, you should be able to.",
    "I just had a, um, a bunch of big lag spike in OBS.",
    "It looks like I'm back though.",
    "Yeah, II.",
    "Hopefully maybe.",
    "No.",
    "Um?",
    "Yeah, it looks like I'm back.",
    "We're going to press on.",
    "If you're seeing if a little live icon at the bottom of your screen is not ready, you can go ahead and refresh and you'll get the live feed, but I should be back.",
    "Drawing mostly once I came up with after I had started that set.",
    "Um?",
    "Kind of on the fly.",
    "So it's just, you know, once you get in the mode.",
    "And, as in many things, the biggest star.",
    "The toughest part is starting.",
    "And I found that out and doing a lot of different things.",
    "So there's that all.",
    "Erase the.",
    "Her little body bit right there in a minute.",
    "So she's right there and I'm going to have coconut here.",
    "She's kind of.",
    "She's kind of walking down this path here, and maybe she's picking up some stuff over here.",
    "You know those like a bag or something here?",
    "Straight from listening.",
    "Hey girl, and now since she's in a graph I can erase her really easily.",
    "Now she find help.",
    "I'm saving up for yes, absolutely.",
    "And that's something that I've been looking into.",
    "That and my prompt.",
    "My big issue is I don't have a Mac an I'm everything is PC, so I don't have an.",
    "Apparently you can only code for the iTunes store if you can get on a Mac and use X code and then all of that good stuff, but I did find out recently.",
    "You can actually rent a Mac you can like log in an rent a cloud Mac and I could develop on that.",
    "So that's my next step that I'm going to try, 'cause otherwise I've been looking in.",
    "Seeing if any any of my local friends are getting rid of something really old that they wouldn't mind selling me.",
    "I just like I don't really want to buy it just for that, but the cloud rental things are pretty cool.",
    "And just as long as my files don't disappear when I log off, I think that would be gravy.",
    "But I'm going to definitely.",
    "Up Get that one done.",
    "Let's get this can drawn.",
    "He's kind of having issues.",
    "Now I need to go in here and.",
    "Need to ask about that moment is faster.",
    "I was looking out for a couple of an Android I can develop.",
    "I've got the whole list of how to do that for WhatsApp and.",
    "All that good stuff.",
    "Um?",
    "And honestly, I don't mind no.",
    "That stuff I used to love programming.",
    "But it just seems like when I.",
    "When I would do it for my website, that was a big block because I would always end up breaking something.",
    "And that was never fun and it was always something silly like I had forgotten to close a set of tags or something.",
    "So.",
    "Thank goodness for the days of content management systems now.",
    "All right?",
    "Thank you so much, Dana.",
    "I got them on.",
    "I've gotten the stickers on Jiffy.",
    "I was able to get a creator account there and so if you want to use them on Instagram, all you need to do is search.",
    "Be cute and it'll bring up all the stickers that I've done so far for Instagram stories.",
    "You can also use them in your DMS and.",
    "How is miss you so happy when I see someone use them?",
    "So let's fill on this.",
    "There is a little bit of lag.",
    "Hopefully.",
    "That Is all fixed up.",
    "I lost my train of thought.",
    "20 I was talking about how I personally started using the block Brush.",
    "Alright, so I got my my tablet 2016 and those first few drawings I did on it.",
    "I was still trying to draw.",
    "How I drew with keyboard mouse using the tablet.",
    "So it was a really kind of a.",
    "It was a transition that took a little bit, and so definitely just give you time to get used to the you know, the different tools and.",
    "'cause it'll change the way you do stuff.",
    "And I personally got a lot faster and.",
    "And I feel like I don't know.",
    "Closer to drawing in traditional media which.",
    "Which I think really helps me.",
    "Get excited about.",
    "Drawing in digital, even more so than I had already been doing.",
    "All right?",
    "Let's do this Coco Flex key flexing.",
    "She's doing her best, she's.",
    "All right?",
    "Yeah.",
    "Oh, also, if you're doing a lot of blob brush work, I would come.",
    "I would suggest.",
    "Doing a lot of grouping.",
    "Um?",
    "Because you can lose like what I'm doing right here is, I have all my characters group.",
    "I have generally all of My 93.",
    "I have generally all of my objects grouped.",
    "If you're drawing with a blob brush, you can get.",
    "You can lose a lot of lines you can lose.",
    "It's very easy if you don't have a system of our layers or grouping too.",
    "Is there a lot of them are?",
    "I'm trying to explain it.",
    "Like when I first started out, I would be drawing, you know, doing something and I would lose like Phil or a stroke and it would be really standing out like I change the line color of everything except that one piece.",
    "But because it was buried so far behind other things I couldn't select it.",
    "So the way I answered that problem was to be really vigilant about grouping things.",
    "So if I'm working on a character I will put down one or two strokes.",
    "And then I will group those two strokes and then I will only be operating within that group as far as his character it.",
    "Yes, exactly label as you go.",
    "Just make a habit of being.",
    "Being organized and it'll save you a lot of frustrations, Ann.",
    "'cause I did I did that so many times and.",
    "And will probably if you watch, you know, a lot of my streams, or if you hear me admonishing myself for not drawing in my group, that's why and.",
    "And it's something that you always have to remind yourself to do, even if it's habit that are sometimes slip out of it.",
    "And it will also help you too if your drawing you know really layered drawings.",
    "If you're if you've got a lot of characters you're working with.",
    "Actually, I need to fill in this character.",
    "I need to make coconut appear.",
    "He done some really cool pixel art, some ice creams, isometrics, stuff.",
    "You could totally do your 3D printing stuff.",
    "The next group mystical being.",
    "I need to change a second.",
    "Want her walking down.",
    "Tomorrow.",
    "Make that a little smaller.",
    "Heishin or how are you?",
    "Welcome to the stream.",
    "I'm gonna have to move her over a little bit because I don't want to have their tails walking each other.",
    "Just get her drawn in here and I can kinda just one way or another.",
    "She's gonna be picking stuff up over here.",
    "And she's going to have her little bag she's holding onto here.",
    "Smaller.",
    "Maybe it's dragging.",
    "Yeah, she's dragging it down.",
    "A Hunter.",
    "People.",
    "Can't wait to get home.",
    "Brush I'm using is the blob brush.",
    "It's right over here.",
    "I think it's usually hidden underneath like in the.",
    "Me out of the box tool set and the default one.",
    "I think it's hidden beneath something else, but on mine I have I pop out the tools that I use the most right over here.",
    "So blah brushes what I used to sketch and I use the pencil tool for my color fills.",
    "So like for example on this one I use the blob brush for the line art and then these were just really easy to kind of.",
    "Just fill in and create with the pencil tool.",
    "And these settings that I use.",
    "This song is it really bass heavy?",
    "That's bugging me.",
    "Wow, sorry about that.",
    "Um?",
    "So the settings I have for the blob brush I like so.",
    "Uh, my lips no, don't want to do that I have.",
    "Pressure sensitivity right here an I make sure to have the variations that equal to the point size.",
    "That means that it basically.",
    "Depending on the pressure, can double size and also you know have it.",
    "And then the angle I have is 67 and then I have a little bit of a pinch on the brush tip that helps me 'cause I do.",
    "I do some writing like I'll do sound effects and I'll just use my handwriting.",
    "That gives it a little bit of.",
    "I don't know.",
    "I just like the line quality of it.",
    "So there's that my settings there and then when I'm drawing I'll use these bracket tools up and down.",
    "You can kind of see it.",
    "Yeah you can see it.",
    "You can see how the bracket tool is increasing and decreasing the.",
    "You be it will be able to move them around and edit them easier.",
    "Let's say like you know you have your original idea.",
    "Like through a group shot that you decide you know.",
    "I just want this character to be.",
    "You know, I've got three or four over here.",
    "If you keep these guys groups, you can move everything around and you won't be.",
    "We arrange things on the fly and not being missing strokes or missing, you know important pieces of your liner because things weren't put together.",
    "Um?",
    "They have.",
    "Those are some of the the hard lessons that I learned.",
    "Oh, another thing that was that got me when I first started using illustrator was that perspective.",
    "Graham, I couldn't figure out first I didn't know this.",
    "This is a long time ago.",
    "I didn't know what it was so I couldn't Google how to get rid of it, but I would, you know I'd be using my hotkeys and you're doing stuff and I had accidentally activate it and I wouldn't be able to get rid of it.",
    "And yeah, that one is a frustrating one.",
    "Actually.",
    "I've had a couple of my friends come to me with that same thing, and it's like a moment.",
    "Like you.",
    "Just had your right of passage with the.",
    "With the perspective grid.",
    "Alright, I'll probably move her around a little bit, but I need to come at all group for once.",
    "I have the.",
    "I thought I'd try this near days.",
    "Hello.",
    "Cancel.",
    "Sure.",
    "Steady hand.",
    "I'm from the shoulder.",
    "There we go.",
    "Z snake is a little smaller.",
    "Which Texas had love hate relationship that summarizes it perfectly.",
    "An old man there.",
    "I remember I had a temper tantrum.",
    "I don't have many, but that same caused it and.",
    "I had I think I was under a deadline to make something.",
    "And.",
    "But hey, I've used it before to.",
    "Do, you know, some perspective stuff and it's pretty darn cool.",
    "When you want it to be there.",
    "Alright, so let's put in so these guys are usually on a little stand.",
    "Allows you to tip near.",
    "You know what I'm going to do?",
    "I'm just going to.",
    "First of all, did I agreed things I did when I started drawing outside of the group?",
    "Net.",
    "I don't.",
    "I'm gonna do.",
    "Achieve a little bit.",
    "Since I already have that angle, but I want it to be.",
    "This new member server here.",
    "Actually, I think the ones that I've seen.",
    "Yeah, I'm not going to make it sound elaborate.",
    "This can just be a base.",
    "And maybe have something like this?",
    "To hold it.",
    "I can text while through.",
    "This definitely needs to be a strong cross.",
    "The tip size on the brush.",
    "No, but you need to make a lot smaller now.",
    "So she's dragging this, so we're going to have.",
    "And she's kind of holding it so.",
    "I wanna have Queen size.",
    "This was really bass heavy to Gosh.",
    "I have it on in my head set an if it.",
    "Basically it's too heavy, it just really vibrates.",
    "Up here and it causes a headache so I gotta be careful about that.",
    "Alright, so let's get hurt.",
    "Stripes here and I'm going to just put a tip of her little toe, so if I were to actually draw this out, her leg would be like that and I don't need to draw more because the bag is blocking it.",
    "And I just need to drop that out here and they super tail.",
    "And then I need to put her little shoulder.",
    "Is your shoulders gonna be?",
    "Yes.",
    "I don't need your face line.",
    "She moves her whiskeys in a little bit.",
    "I'm glad you like Diana Black BLOB, BLOB Blob.",
    "Right here my tools that they go la brush if you can see out right now.",
    "Come on blah blah she should be able to see that there you go.",
    "Another thing I would recommend is if you don't have tooltips turned on an you're trying to learn illustrate.",
    "It really is helpful.",
    "I'll take care of Diana.",
    "Have a good day.",
    "Thank you so much for stopping by.",
    "That looks of success.",
    "I lost my chat here.",
    "Alright, we're back alright, I've got chat.",
    "All right?",
    "So what do we need to do?",
    "Since I don't want to have their tails kind of clashing ledford in just a little bit?",
    "And.",
    "Let me draw some of the stuff she's going to pick up here, so she's looking like maybe it just gotta can over here.",
    "It's really good.",
    "Maybe I'll have it.",
    "Best.",
    "And kind of sitting here in the grass.",
    "A little bit concealed.",
    "And then maybe I can start to strengthen that little bit.",
    "Maybe I'll do.",
    "Maybe?",
    "Paper or something?",
    "Alright, let's jump out of level an.",
    "I can now come through and.",
    "Erase some of these things that I don't need.",
    "Like that?",
    "Monkeys indications anymore.",
    "Up It's just a little bit more trash over here.",
    "Tip her head up a little bit screwed that an going here.",
    "Yeah, little bit bigger as she is a full grown cat or coconut leaves and I'll have to probably make her reflection smaller.",
    "Um, do reflections is a little tricky.",
    "Kids.",
    "She's got this back and right here she's holding on to the mirror.",
    "Yeah, you know, not all of this year is going to be oh gosh, that beer is way too big.",
    "My son is take your ear down at some levels normal.",
    "There we go.",
    "She's proud of her girl.",
    "She's happy.",
    "Lips.",
    "23 And since it's going to be behind the mirror, I don't need that her other PA is course behind the mirror.",
    "I'm going to add her tail in here because I don't know how I'm going to movies.",
    "My pieces around yet.",
    "I might come.",
    "I might bring these two a little bit closer, maybe make them a little bit smaller, but they're going to occupy that general space there, and so let's see.",
    "I don't need her face line and let's clean up some of these.",
    "And then I'm gonna add this in here.",
    "And I'll go through.",
    "Probably when I'm in the coloring stage.",
    "And Allah race.",
    "You know, the bits of the lines that I don't need, but for now I like to keep everything as much as possible.",
    "So I'll erase a good amount of you know her since I haven't group too.",
    "It'll be easier so I just you know what?",
    "Why don't I just do it now?",
    "And erase this.",
    "I know that's where I wanted to be so I don't really see that I'll be changing her position a lot.",
    "And then her paw is in front.",
    "So I'm going to select this and always nice.",
    "I don't always do this.",
    "Sometimes I like to leave everything intact again if I wanna raise things moving around, but I'm pretty confident that's where I want her to be.",
    "So I'm gonna move this forward.",
    "Just a snitch.",
    "And then I'm gonna come over here and take out my little guidance sketch.",
    "Looking over there.",
    "Come back here and hit save.",
    "Say that you haven't yet.",
    "Mostly out of Snitch.",
    "And I might rearrange her tail.",
    "And here I think I need to make cocoa.",
    "Let's jump out a little and you just select her and I'm going to drop her down a little bit.",
    "And that's a little better.",
    "There we go.",
    "That looks like she's looking at herself in the mirror.",
    "And I thought this here.",
    "Wanna have it centered on this?",
    "'cause I have a pending.",
    "And the final.",
    "Before I say my liner is done is always this.",
    "How to add?",
    "Website.",
    "Right, so when was little.",
    "But I wanted to do it here.",
    "I don't like that they're floating kind of in space, so I'm just going to.",
    "I'm gonna give him a little bit of something underneath.",
    "Actually, and this is an example of me using the blood rushes to draw it out a little bit.",
    "From Let's do something over sure.",
    "All right now, they're not floating in the middle of nowhere.",
    "And it still kittens.",
    "She needs to be small alright.",
    "So starting today with a Cup of kindness and then I go through and these are the kindness is there doing.",
    "With an Asian Center, the difference between is inside you.",
    "I like that a lot.",
    "And this whole comic was inspired by.",
    "This little lettering thing I did yesterday as I come.",
    "When I was.",
    "Initially putting the idea together, I started sketching out that comic and so kind of went one.",
    "In the other hand in hand so.",
    "I will be doing a snitch a smidge.",
    "Of editing, probably on um, just some general sizing and placement.",
    "I do like this how it is I might.",
    "I make so I don't know.",
    "I might draw a little extra here just to fill that up a little bit, but I in general I really like how this is laid out now instead of the three across it.",
    "Kind of feels more full and so my next steps I won't be getting to those on stream today, but my next step is coloring and I started all pretty much the same way.",
    "I stroke everything with the line color with the exception of this one.",
    "And I want to push that in the back a little bit.",
    "So I separated this section out and actually let me go back here and I'm going to do it this way.",
    "We're going to Desaturate.",
    "We're going to desaturate this color.",
    "An late, never little bit.",
    "And that will give up.",
    "See how it looks a little bit further away now.",
    "And it's just that subtle change in line color, and that that kind of helps me to to remember that you know when I'm coloring this section, my colors are going to be a little bit less saturated.",
    "'cause this is further away and I need to convey that in the colour as well as the Wiener.",
    "So, uhm.",
    "And for some reason, food donation center is all wonky.",
    "Did you make that bigger?",
    "Let's see, let's bring food down.",
    "123 big There we go.",
    "So that's another thing.",
    "If there are background elements.",
    "If there are sound effects are generally do that.",
    "In my own handwriting, and then the comic text itself will be.",
    "Will be regular text late in life that also this.",
    "I don't want it to be as big as my colleague.",
    "It's funky's up to.",
    "So.",
    "And I'm like, yeah, so that's it for me today.",
    "Thank you so much for joining me.",
    "I hope you have a great rest of your Thursday if you want to see how this comic ends up, I will be posting it on all my socials I posted on website, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook.",
    "I also post in R comics on Reddit and those go up generally around 9:00 AM.",
    "In the morning on Fridays and Tuesdays.",
    "Inside post twice a week.",
    "I'm working on three week and thinking that third post office Sunday.",
    "But if you start seeing me randomly post on Sunday, I'm testing out my schedule so.",
    "I always do a lot of testing before I you know doing announcement on it just to make sure that I can keep that schedule and keep my commitment that I made.",
    "So let me put up my ending screen on my left is the my Facebook, my Twitter and my Instagram.",
    "I do dailies on Twitter and Instagram.",
    "I kind of curate Facebook a little more so if you want some cute but don't want to see it all the time I would suggest looking at.",
    "Facebook, but if you wanna see dailies, I post those on Twitter and Instagram.",
    "So next time I'm live will be Tuesday and that will be with a challenge.",
    "I need to figure out what it will be.",
    "I'm not going to do another scene study I might do and expressions challenge with some in notes or.",
    "Oh I.",
    "Rash, Mahan Uhm you know what here actually yeah let me let me just answer that real quick so my tools are I use for line art.",
    "I used the blob brush.",
    "Um, which is the Sky right here I do my sketching initially in the blob brush and then I do my line art and with it as well.",
    "And then when I color let's see, let's go in here.",
    "Give you an example.",
    "I use the pencil tool right here, which is the other tool tips on.",
    "You can see that right there.",
    "I use this to create my fills for large areas so like if I'm coloring the character if I am.",
    "Doing Siri, I'll use the pencil tool to fill in large sections there and then I'll come through with either the pencil tool again or the BLOB brush and I'll add, you know, values and shading and things like that.",
    "Smaller areas like this all generally do with the blob rush just to kind of paint it in, but if larger areas, I'm delete.",
    "This really isn't a good example.",
    "This is a better example, so this is last two.",
    "This is Tuesday's past Tuesday's comic.",
    "Um?",
    "So let's take this this one for example.",
    "I there we go here is layer group rather where I colored everything so you'll see back here.",
    "I have a big section I laid in a gradient that kind of created the dark Moody forest in the background.",
    "And then I came over with I drew these shapes here with the pencil tool just to give it a little bit more depth to kind of to show that it's going, you know, kind of just fading out into the darkness there, but we have this right.",
    "Pool of light out here and so kind of like a break in the trees and I wanted to push that light so I had to make this background pretty dark and.",
    "Then I have the light that's, you know, kind of reflecting off the water.",
    "We got.",
    "This grass is here.",
    "It's a little bit lighter, a little bit more saturated.",
    "And then I have these areas of Dappled, Dappled Light where what light is filtering through this dense tree cover, and it's just hitting her.",
    "If she's jumping into this little pool, and so the way I did this again was I went through and I've got my little selections of where I want shadows to be.",
    "I'm thinking right here that OK, I need a shadow of.",
    "This giant tree over here and I need a little bit of the shoreline and this is a big Hill that's kind of bumping out over the water so I need to reflect that in the water.",
    "And then I would come in, for example, to do this lighting effect right here.",
    "what I did was I took, I drew the general area of the kind of dapple light, and then I would come through and I would do highlights over here with the blob brush because it's a very thin line that I wanted.",
    "And it would just be easier for me to just kind of go in there and draw it in.",
    "So I kind of alternate when I'm coloring back and forth between those tools.",
    "And if you want to see.",
    "Right now.",
    "They're all the outlines of everything.",
    "You kind of see.",
    "All the different scenes like that.",
    "But that's kind of how I put together.",
    "Each of my panels and drawings and the general tools that I use.",
    "I use a lot of gradients.",
    "I use a lot of I use heavily the Hue Saturation, balanced panel for editing my colors and I'm always trying to think about, you know.",
    "What my focus is when I'm drawing.",
    "Uhm, you know, if I want this to be the focus, I kind of want a lot of my elements to subtly point to that focus and.",
    "I'll do that, you know, just in different different ways.",
    "Um?",
    "Let me see what else do I use.",
    "But yeah, see this this stuff down here.",
    "That's all.",
    "Blah brush that's all detailing I put in on the ground with a blob brush tool.",
    "If you're thinking about using it, I would just, you know, experiment a little bit.",
    "You know.",
    "Look at the.",
    "Look at the settings right here and mess around with those a lot.",
    "See what you like 'cause you can turn this pen tip into whatever you want.",
    "You can make it a you know, like a slant tip, calligraphy pen like you're like.",
    "Really neat lettering just by messing with these settings and making this roundness.",
    "You can take it all the way down so it's just a tiny split and then you can do really need effects.",
    "With that you can meet textures and stuff and grass is.",
    "Let's play around with those settings.",
    "If you're thinking about trying out the blob brush for drawing, it's you know if you're coming from doing a lot of graphic design and a lot of precision an using the pen tool, it can be a little grading because I mean, I did that a lot.",
    "I was kind of stuck because I liked the precision of, you know, the fewest points, treats the most beautiful lines and curves, but this is a very messy style, but that's more of my drawing style, and that's something that you kind of have to discover for yourself.",
    "Um?",
    "And figure out for yourself.",
    "But it's definitely a fun tool to use, and I think, at least for me personally, it bridges traditional.",
    "Drawing with digital drawing a little better.",
    "It's kind of closer to I imagine what you would be doing and photo shop for different brushes there.",
    "I mean, besides, of course you know creating the texture and stuff, but you're doing liner.",
    "I think a lot of people generally use that the soft round or whatever it is.",
    "But yeah, so that's a little bit about my tools.",
    "Uhm, hopefully that helps.",
    "Rush Mahan if you have any other questions I am about to lagaf here so go back over this and zoom out.",
    "There is the finished comic I will be actually go over that real quick too.",
    "I don't need to make that.",
    "I'll just go in here.",
    "So here's an example of a finished comics for web layout for Twitter and website and read.",
    "It would be a one pager that's kind of optimized for mobile viewing and scrolling.",
    "Then this is how I optimize it for Instagram if I want to have a seamless.",
    "Seamless some you know, swipe what I'll do is I'll create two art boards that are butted up against each other and then the separate ones of course are a lot easier to do, but that's how I come in.",
    "Split it out for different the same content for different platforms.",
    "Oh, you're welcome.",
    "He sticky sticky him about to end stream.",
    "How you doing sticky?",
    "I hope you're having a good day.",
    "But yeah, so thank you so much for joining you today.",
    "I hope you have a great rest of your Thursday.",
    "I'm going to put up my ending screen.",
    "There we go, once again my socials over to the left I Post Daily on Instagram and Twitter.",
    "We wanna catch those there.",
    "One last question, which is your drawing tablet.",
    "It is the Sintec 13 HD I believe they have a pro version of.",
    "Uh, the 13, but I think that the current model is the walk home.",
    "One is a 13 inch screen I believe, and then they have a pro 16.",
    "As Pro 24 and a pro 32, and I thought there was a pro 13 but for some reason I don't see it a lot.",
    "He is a Scott.",
    "All right, uhm, yeah, so that's it for me today.",
    "Still a little bit more kind of a fluffy greens.",
    "Inside this bag of groceries.",
    "Fix the sound a little bit.",
    "There's farm don't fight like.",
    "Hey Ryan, how are you today?",
    "How's it going for you?",
    "I am drawing some groceries.",
    "Almost done.",
    "With this crosswalk.",
    "And then actually I think I am done.",
    "I need to hold up here.",
    "Delete that.",
    "And I need to delete some of these extra lines.",
    "Crossing here.",
    "Those.",
    "Well, in that way.",
    "Characters are helping Granny bear cross the road today.",
    "All right?",
    "Please let me know which tools you're using for handwriting.",
    "Oh, that are.",
    "Let's see I use actually this is just blah brush and I usually do that with sound effects.",
    "The only thing I'll use the text tool for in the comic is the regular comic text.",
    "I like to keep that consistent and use my font there.",
    "But as far as this stuff it's just wild brush and I.",
    "Increase the font size 1 size the tip size on the brush.",
    "Up and down as I need it and then here are the settings right here.",
    "Right now the size of the point is 13, but this is what I keep constant.",
    "The angle at 67 and the roundness at 85.",
    "I like a little pinch on the tip just to give it, especially if I'm doing stuff with lettering.",
    "It gives a little I don't know.",
    "I just like it.",
    "It feels like a pocket brush pen to me, especially when when I do.",
    "Stuff like this, you know, and I press hard to get that big line variance that is exactly what I do with my pentel pocket brush pen when I'm doing traditional stuff, so I kind of wanted to create.",
    "Something that would function like that for my comics, which I need to save.",
    "There we go.",
    "So like.",
    "Like here I have two indications right here.",
    "I'm going to have text here and text here.",
    "I'm gonna go ahead and just drop that in there show you.",
    "Uhm, yeah, that's where is my service.",
    "So that's my regular comic text.",
    "And all arrange these differently.",
    "I'm probably going to divide this up to keep get it even I don't like that.",
    "The center area started staying clean.",
    "Nails and go.",
    "And then I'll give them a little bit of shattering underneath.",
    "And here the good deeds are doing throughout the day and the last one is going to be making deliveries to a food pantry.",
    "And then she's going to be reflecting on how good that made her feel.",
    "Um?",
    "But yeah, if you have any other questions, just let me know.",
    "The blob brush is wonderful.",
    "Uhm, I think.",
    "Is pretty close if you're used to like drawing in in photo shop in doing line work there.",
    "I feel like this is pretty close to that.",
    "I mean, this is my main sketch tool that I use all the time and I'll come through and I do like this is my thing I did yesterday.",
    "I did all my line work here and you can see.",
    "That over this is my starting sketch and sketched it all with the blob brush tool.",
    "Did all of the kind of rough.",
    "You know organization of the design here and then I came through and didn't want to do that.",
    "There we go.",
    "I came through and did all the final leiningen lettering with that.",
    "Southland brush and then when I wanted to color it, I came over here with my pencil tool and I created my fills and it's pretty much drawing with the BLOB brush and coloring with the pencil tool and then when I do shading.",
    "Also I'll use both.",
    "Depends on the size of the area that I'm trying to shade.",
    "If it's a smaller area, I'll just pick up the blob brush.",
    "If it's a larger area, I'll draw the shapes in the pencil tool.",
    "But yeah, I'm really excited about how this turned out.",
    "It's going to be on a holographic sticker, and it's going to be printed at all in white.",
    "And then this is the regular version.",
    "I may do two versions of that sticker depending on how.",
    "That comes out, but let's see.",
    "So this is turning out.",
    "I kinda wanna do.",
    "Oh, I can mess around with you arrangement later.",
    "Let me just get this.",
    "Um?",
    "Fixed up.",
    "All right, so next is making a.",
    "You know I could.",
    "I could give these guys more stage.",
    "I could blow them up.",
    "I could do this over Eclipse.",
    "Cool.",
    "I figured this more room over here.",
    "And have this panel right here.",
    "I kind of like that.",
    "Christmas can't lose my indication for my.",
    "My text, so if I do that I can move this guy right here.",
    "So it'll kind of flow.",
    "Supposed to that.",
    "Because these are all text list panels.",
    "I kind of like the flow of that better.",
    "So if I am, I can take these two out.",
    "It doesn't even more.",
    "Yeah, I like that a lot.",
    "That 'cause I like the detail I put into these panels an I want to showcase that more so if that is the.",
    "OK, that is the case.",
    "Then I want to have this panel waited to point this direction.",
    "So let's figure that out.",
    "This is, uh?",
    "Alright, helping across the street.",
    "Then we have the Food Bank.",
    "Let's see.",
    "I could have let me just sketch this out a little bit better.",
    "I wanna have them frames.",
    "Alright, so this is going to be kind of this is a smaller leading.",
    "She's pointing over here and then.",
    "This is going to lead here.",
    "I like that.",
    "So there's going to be a food bank in the background so this will be like kind of like this.",
    "There we go.",
    "And so there on that road.",
    "And then there's my text on that one.",
    "Alright, yay.",
    "That was the only panel I hadn't figured out last night.",
    "I knew I wanted to do something with food donation, and I'm really glad I decided to open this up a little bit.",
    "Alright, so then this last one is going to be.",
    "I'm gonna go ahead and drop this down to.",
    "Percent.",
    "And I'm gonna go over here and there, grab.",
    "100 I put it, the difference begins inside you.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Starting stay with a Cup of kindness.",
    "The difference begins inside you.",
    "Times.",
    "Make that a little bigger and kind of like how this is flowing, so this will be.",
    "Add a little bit.",
    "I'm gonna give them a little bit more room.",
    "All right, there we go.",
    "So before I go into that, I'm going to take a quick stretch, an water break, and I will be right back.",
    "If you are working on something, be sure to save and take a stretch for yourself too.",
    "That's actually one of the things I wanted to switch my screen too.",
    "I wanted to do some.",
    "Hand exercises for artists and that type of thing.",
    "I think that could actually be a comic in itself.",
    "I don't think I have that idea written down.",
    "I need to write it down.",
    "Tips for OK.",
    "Alright, so just to show I haven't showed this yet.",
    "Today on I get asked a lot where I come up with my ideas and this is a look at my my idea book.",
    "I just start writing and I try to.",
    "When I sit down to write I start with a goal.",
    "Just fill a page.",
    "It doesn't matter if it's just a word list Word Association, if it's a brain dump or if I actually have ideas that are more.",
    "Crystallized in that sometimes.",
