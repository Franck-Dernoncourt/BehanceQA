    "Not entirely different, but probably different.",
    "Next week.",
    "To be honest, I have no idea when I'm going to be doing next week.",
    "Anyways, probably I really enjoy these kind of studies, the.",
    "Value studies specially based on.",
    "Uh.",
    "Busts and statues.",
    "'cause typically they are well lit.",
    "And the lighting is is.",
    "A big thing when it comes to.",
    "Having having your studies turn out well, that makes sense.",
    "If the lighting of the statue or whatever your references is poor, you're not going to be able to.",
    "Gain potential information.",
    "Potential information.",
    "I know what, how would you say that it just?",
    "It really depends on the lighting.",
    "How well lit.",
    "And what is it?",
    "James James Gurney?",
    "It talks about this is actually a photo from I think his book.",
    "The Abe Lincoln",
    "'cause he goes over the different types of typical lighting setups that you'll see.",
    "Um?",
    "And like cinema and film and.",
    "Anything really?",
    "Photography properly like your.",
    "Here's subject.",
    "So it shows the most form.",
    "I would assume that's what it is.",
    "It's just to show.",
    "It.",
    "Shape and form and.",
    "Not just be washed out anyways.",
    "Hum.",
    "Do I have anything else to really say?",
    "I don't think I really do.",
    "I'm going to turn turn this down a little bit more.",
    "For you guys, that's probably too quiet day.",
    "You guys let me know if anything is too loud.",
    "We're still.",
    "There's going to be a lot of.",
    "Ironing out Uh.",
    "Dustin off.",
    "Getting getting things to a.",
    "All right?",
    "Passable.",
    "Quality level of quality for the streams.",
    "Uh.",
    "I think this is good at the bars.",
    "The bar thing is an OBS local kata, me know if any of you guys.",
    "Stream also, but that's.",
    "It's one thing to judge by sound bars are looking I'm in this corner too.",
    "I think this is my OG corner.",
    "I think.",
    "I don't know if you guys remember.",
    "Can I stream?",
    "Much more frequently.",
    "And then I do.",
    "Currently I think this was the side of the screen that I was on and then I would be looking in.",
    "To the image right to the video.",
    "Anyways, whatever, let's jump into it, man.",
    "Do it, hope you guys are having a good day.",
    "Evening, afternoon.",
    "Friday Mean.",
    "It's going to say I'm looking forward to the weekend, but.",
    "It's just kind of like another day.",
    "You know what I mean?",
    "That sounds really sad.",
    "One of it I didn't mean for it to sound really sad.",
    "I'm enjoy.",
    "I don't work during the weekends.",
    "I think that's something that I've done.",
    "Uh.",
    "I don't know since I've pretty much started.",
    "Freelancing is just.",
    "As long as the schedule allows it right, I don't work on the weekends.",
    "Time.",
    "I guess you really are in charge of your own schedule, so it's it's kind of it's kind of up to you whether you want.",
    "Um?",
    "To work more hours during the week, days right?",
    "But thankfully I'm able to take the weekends off.",
    "There's a lot more that I can go and do with that, but I think I think we'll just.",
    "Will stick with the studies for now.",
    "I don't know, maybe maybe I will.",
    "Rant on about.",
    "Scheduling obtaining work.",
    "I think the most difficult thing as a freelancer.",
    "I guess I'm going into this now as a freelancer is establishing a client base right?",
    "Um?",
    "That's probably the most difficult thing is just getting that rolling.",
    "And once that.",
    "Kind of.",
    "You found concurrent work.",
    "Setting up your schedule on how often you want to work so you can pay the bills.",
    "It's such a you're constantly balancing.",
    "So you're spinning plates and you're putting new.",
    "Plates in the Iron.",
    "I don't know.",
    "I'm trying to melt a bunch of metaphors.",
    "You know always having more irons in the fire.",
    "You know, planting seeds.",
    "Weather, weather, other metaphors can be used.",
    "I don't know.",
    "That's all we'll we'll use for now.",
    "There's always something else.",
    "That's going.",
    "At least in my world I gotta turn it down a little bit more mind.",
    "Maybe that's better.",
    "I want to be yelling at you guys.",
    "I don't want to be shouting.",
    "I feel like I'm shouting.",
    "And you guys didn't ask for that.",
    "I mean, even if you did I don't think I'd feel comfortable.",
    "Showing you guys alright so.",
    "Hey buddy, can you shut up and draw?",
    "I will.",
    "I'll so the next.",
    "This is just all on its own layer.",
    "You know we have the reference in the background.",
    "We got the reference right here.",
    "We got our line drawing.",
    "On this layer, the next step that I would typically do is.",
    "I think we can go ahead and.",
    "Make an opaque layer, kind of like masking layer.",
    "Of just the just the bust so.",
    "What I'm going to do in Photoshop Here is.",
    "You guys see where my mouse is right here on the far left.",
    "Right and I showed this before.",
    "This is if you just leave your mouse.",
    "Over it, it'll it'll give you the.",
    "You know the info on what it is edit and quick mask mode.",
    "That doesn't really tell me a whole lot if I'm if I'm being honest and I don't really know what quick mask mode is, but thankfully I can.",
    "I can share that with you, I guess, and show you what it is.",
    "So I'm going to go ahead and click it.",
    "Right so now we've activated that mode right.",
    "So if we if we click it again, we go back to standard mode.",
    "And what this will do is you notice your layer over here.",
    "It's turned pink.",
    "And your paint.",
    "His turn pink as well.",
    "So basically everything that you paint while you're in this mode.",
    "Even the cool thing is you can even.",
    "Paint with different opacities, right?",
    "Different levels of transparency and it will.",
    "Also it will consider that it will take that into effect for when you leave this mode.",
    "So we go back over and we click it again.",
    "It might not look that like where that selection is.",
    "It might not look where we painted is also a selection, but it is.",
    "So it makes sense.",
    "You know, I'm saying.",
    "It's it's a transparent selection.",
    "It still right here as well.",
    "But what it does?",
    "This is really confusing.",
    "I'm already really confused.",
    "But we'll go.",
    "We'll pretend we're following along.",
    "What it does is it selects everything besides what you painted.",
    "So it makes sense.",
    "So all the all the pink.",
    "All the things that you just put down, it's not selecting that right.",
    "It's like being the opposite of that.",
    "Any issues?",
    "No.",
    "Cool.",
    "Girlfriend just picked up some.",
    "Dog food for OB.",
    "Gotta eat.",
    "So let's try that again.",
    "Let's do that again here.",
    "So we activate the mode.",
    "An I'm basically just going to be.",
    "Painting and everywhere.",
    "You know it probably make a lot more sense if I just use like an opaque brush, but.",
    "I'm going to stick to this for now.",
    "Right, so it's pretty, you know.",
    "So there's so many different ways that you can.",
    "Make your masking layer or your I guess your.",
    "I don't even know where your base layer, the layer that you cut out.",
    "That's opaque that solid.",
    "This is one of the ways that I like to do it.",
    "'cause I find out my hand I have.",
    "I have a tremor so I'm constantly just.",
    "My hand is.",
    "Disobeying.",
    "100% of the time.",
    "I guess, and obviously not 100% of the time, but it's very difficult to to use like a lasso tool and be really precise with that.",
    "I find that this gives me a lot more control.",
    "When I'm trying to make like a selection also, you will still find myself using the lasso tool all the time, right?",
    "For like free transform selections and stuff like that.",
    "But for when it comes to.",
    "You know cleaning up your lines and turning them into opaque.",
    "Layers.",
    "For.",
    "Getting ready for painting.",
    "I'll usually go with this.",
    "See like 90% of the time.",
    "Cool, OK, so I think that's probably get that.",
    "Let's do that alright, so that's that.",
    "I'm going to turn off the mode now.",
    "Right, and so it's got.",
    "You can see it's got the marching ants here.",
    "It's also got the marching ants.",
    "Going all around the canvas right?",
    "So that tells you what's being selected.",
    "Basically everything but the line works being selected.",
    "In this particular case, that's what we want, so I'm going to turn off the line layer.",
    "Right, I'm going to turn this off and I'm going to hit control alt shift E.",
    "Just kidding, I have to make a layer first control alt shift E have to make a layer for there to be allowed to merge everything on, which is what shortcut command is.",
    "And then I'm going to hit.",
    "Delete.",
    "So all that will be left is that area that we painted in with that pink color right?",
    "That makes sense.",
    "You guys let me know if there's ever a question.",
    "Especially regarding regarding what we're doing, we're actually doing.",
    "On the screen.",
    "You can stop me at anytime.",
    "Are you alright?",
    "OK.",
    "Girlfriends.",
    "Lifting heavy things, I'm assuming.",
    "I'm just saying if there's ever if you guys ever have a question about whatever I'm doing.",
    "Like I said specifically about what you're seeing on the screen, ask away man.",
    "I have no issues going over that.",
    "To clarify things alright, so we have that on its own layer.",
    "Get the line there.",
    "You can even see it's masking arlyne layer.",
    "We bring it up, you can see it now.",
    "What I'm going to do is actually going to duplicate that so we have just the line layer in the back so we can put that onto.",
    "That layer we just made.",
    "And in fact, I think I'll just until a little bit so hit control you.",
    "Tinted a little bit.",
    "So it kind of stands out right?",
    "We have that selection.",
    "So that's what we painted.",
    "Another thing to do is I usually duplicate this a couple of times.",
    "Just in case.",
    "So my brush strokes when I was selecting that in the mask mode here.",
    "Just in case they weren't fully opaque.",
    "You know, if there's a little bit of transparency like I mentioned, when you're in that mode and your painting.",
    "You accidentally paint something transparently.",
    "It will remain that way, and when you turn off the mode, so duplicating your layer and merging them together pretty much takes care of anything that's not opaque.",
    "Now I'm going to hold down alt in between.",
    "These two layers so it clips on like that.",
    "If you notice, you guys are probably already all from familiar with this stuff.",
    "You know, if you can see.",
    "Along the edges.",
    "When you clip it on like this, it stops anything that's on this layer from appearing.",
    "Outside of what we have painted on this base layer, right?",
    "Very helpful, kind of.",
    "Beginner stuff.",
    "But once you once you know it's pretty much.",
    "Part of your setup, at least it was for me.",
    "I can't say this is exactly how everybody paints.",
    "'cause it's definitely not right.",
    "We're all.",
    "Unique snowflakes, right?",
    "Actually that has a different meaning nowadays, right?",
    "Well, unique.",
    "Frozen water falling from the Sky.",
    "There we go.",
    "Saved or good now.",
    "All right, so next I think we're pretty much ready for adding to jump into painting.",
    "Selecting my brush.",
    "I like this one and I have my brush set available in the info.",
    "I think you features.",
    "Click it right.",
    "Let me just.",
    "Yeah, if you click the info button.",
    "At the top.",
    "It should be what it should be.",
    "Like up there on your screen, if you're if you're watching from browser.",
    "If you click that you can download the brushes as well.",
    "So what I want to do?",
    "You know, we could use this.",
    "I don't know if I want to use this just yet, it has.",
    "There's some nice texture to it.",
    "It's like traditional kind of it looks like.",
    "It doesn't.",
    "It looks like a brush like an actual hair brush, but also not her hair brush.",
    "But what do you?",
    "What do you call it?",
    "It's got hairs on insta.",
    "Brush painting brush.",
    "Ann But I don't think I really want that texture starting out just yet.",
    "So I think I'm just going to stick with the digital round brush for now.",
    "And.",
    "Observe the darker values so typically.",
    "But what I'm comfortable with and it doesn't have to be what you're comfortable with, is starting with the darker values 1st, and then building up.",
    "From there.",
    "Same mentality of starting with larger shapes.",
    "You know, get the broad strokes down 1st and then refine from there.",
    "All right?",
    "So let's do that.",
    "So obviously this kind of.",
    "Area.",
    "Go back in with eraser.",
    "Not too worried about overlapping.",
    "Of my brush strokes just yet.",
    "You know, I guess I could probably still paint underneath the lines.",
    "Right?",
    "For now and then, once I've finished with this phase this stage.",
    "Um?",
    "That's probably when I can switch to a layer above the lines.",
    "I'm going to make this a little bit later.",
    "Anything like that for now.",
    "You know we can kind of technically technically say this is just like a paint by number.",
    "You know we're just kind of filling in the areas that we have.",
    "Already created for cells.",
    "Defined by our line drawing.",
    "I'm also using a smudge tool.",
    "To break the edges of my, blend the edges of mine.",
    "Round paint brush.",
    "Brush strokes rather.",
    "I'm going to say all kinds of wrong things on painting as well, streaming, hanging out.",
    "I watched through.",
    "The vad to get a sense of the sound and I fix the there's no more black bars on the sides of the.",
    "Screen here, so I fix the resolution.",
    "Should be good.",
    "You guys should be seeing.",
    "What I'm seeing on my screen right?",
    "Um?",
    "Was I saying and?",
    "Oh yeah, I'm just going to.",
    "I'm just.",
    "Just blathering on.",
    "Just whatever comes in my mind is.",
    "Not, that's not entirely true.",
    "Definitely not.",
    "And I'll hold back on some of the.",
    "Stuff that I would normally just.",
    "Spurt out butter.",
    "Anyways, we don't.",
    "Well, I do plan on.",
    "I'll say I do plan on returning to twitch at some point.",
    "I look forward to the day right now scheduling with a lot of the work that I have.",
    "Currently scheduled, it just doesn't allow it.",
    "And also, like I definitely could absolutely could, but the type of Derek that you would get it would be just one who's completely brain dead.",
    "You know, I think.",
    "I really want to make sure.",
    "And I think I've been doing a good job is.",
    "I had a tendency to, I think a lot of us can.",
    "Relate to this is.",
    "We tend to bite off more than we can chew.",
    "In respect of.",
    "Our time.",
    "You know, not giving us.",
    "Time away.",
    "From our work and just always having hey.",
    "Kitties I'm at work.",
    "Discipline his cats totally understand what that is.",
    "Was I saying anyways?",
    "Well, what was I saying?",
    "I was going somewhere?",
    "This is what happens when you get old.",
    "First of all, you start rambling about nonsense.",
    "Doesn't really matter.",
    "Which is why I probably forgot what I was talking about.",
    "Um?",
    "Hold on, I'm going to want to retrace my steps.",
    "I was getting summers.",
    "And if I can't, then.",
    "I can't.",
    "Oh yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, uh, appropriate amount of time to work scheduling all that stuff really important.",
    "I think a lot of us have a difficult a difficulty with it.",
    "I think especially early on.",
    "Especially early on 'cause for me at least I I struggle with it earlier on.",
    "'cause I was just taking any work that I could.",
    "Right?",
    "And also as a little bit more passionate.",
    "Which kind of like I feel ashamed to even admit, like I was much more passionate and driven.",
    "I guess that's the word right.",
    "You're when you're starting off in your journey.",
    "You know the first couple of years, you're just really passionate.",
    "And then I don't know if this is the same for everybody else, but this is this is my.",
    "Experience with.",
    "You know starting freelance work.",
    "I'm working for yourself right is I would I probably worked like 12 hour days everyday.",
    "4.",
    "2.",
    "2 1/2 to three years.",
    "You know an.",
    "After that I think it started to catch up with me.",
    "You know work with some days working 16 hours.",
    "This is when you know.",
    "The.",
    "What is it called?",
    "Is called RTS.",
    "Repetitive stress disorder or syndrome.",
    "I think that's what it's called.",
    "When that started to show up for me and I started to get like really awful wrist pains.",
    "And that kind of bummed me out.",
    "'cause then I couldn't paint.",
    "And then when I couldn't paint, I felt like I was.",
    "Just a waste of space and.",
    "All this other stuff and then your brain does word literally are like our worst.",
    "I wasn't out like not critic.",
    "I guess we are that as well, but the thing that we need to watch out for.",
    "The most is ourselves.",
    "When were working for ourselves so you don't want to.",
    "Well, I guess hurt yourself.",
    "No, I'm trying to say like you don't.",
    "You just don't want to burn out.",
    "That's another aspect to which I think that's what I just got through just got over.",
    "You know it effects our mental health.",
    "I can say that I've also experienced that as well.",
    "You know, that's constantly a regular.",
    "In my life.",
    "You know it ebbs and flows and I think I was talking about that.",
    "Yesterday, yesterday's dream.",
    "You know it's all just each kinda have to ride it out.",
    "But in terms of like setting up your schedule.",
    "Going back to like saying that I would definitely be.",
    "I want to and I will be returning back to streaming on a regular.",
    "You know, probably maybe four to five days a week.",
    "I think between here and Twitch in the following weeks.",
    "Hum.",
    "I think that would be.",
    "A good reasonable schedule.",
    "For about like, two to three hours I think.",
    "That's what I'm thinking right now, but I'm not going to.",
    "I'm not going to say anything in stone for the for the sake of my schedule.",
    "I need to make sure that things are.",
    "Finished, you know?",
    "That I can allow myself.",
    "These windows of time to stream.",
    "Right?",
    "OK, so that value there.",
    "I think I want to add.",
    "You know a little bit distracted by myself.",
    "At this.",
    "Right and in my mind I'm trying to think that of.",
    "Not just this being a value, but I'm actually kind of.",
    "Chiseling away.",
    "Like I'm carving.",
    "You know things that are shadows, you're kind of.",
    "Carving into and things that are lighter, kind of.",
    "Pulling the surface to you, I don't know.",
    "Maybe maybe that's.",
    "That's something.",
    "Helpful to share, but.",
    "I find I find that that helps get my brain into.",
    "Justifying word value goes.",
    "This thinking like you're carving.",
    "Right, but you also have to.",
    "There's like different settings for your brain to always be jumping from.",
    "Even though you still painting on the same image, you know the sketch part of my brain is completely different from.",
    "From the line clean up part of my brain.",
    "Right?",
    "Or this maybe maybe this.",
    "I'm still using that a little bit of a part of my brain.",
    "OK, you know which is never mind.",
    "Let Oh my goodness.",
    "It's clearly you can see that part of my brain is underdeveloped.",
    "Any other darker value areas?",
    "Right here.",
    "Just talking nonsense man.",
    "Got here is a little bit lighter in value, but I think.",
    "Go ahead and add that.",
    "This.",
    "You know, and then once you have all these kind of.",
    "At.",
    "Your dark value, your midtones, your light tones in there just comes down to blending the values together.",
    "It's that easy.",
    "You know what I'm getting at Dog, Yeah?",
    "You know?",
    "You know words?",
    "Words do that thing.",
    "Right exactly yeah exactly yeah.",
    "Yeah yeah, yeah, exactly.",
    "So I think we could probably even go a little bit darker in some of these values, so let's do that.",
    "I'm still like I'm just trying to find the value that I want to use.",
    "So that Button Press that you're hearing like this one here, not one that you're hearing.",
    "That salt, right?",
    "That gets the little eye dropper.",
    "That's a default setting.",
    "So just kind of.",
    "Mix the values that I already have and then re sample.",
    "I'm already getting into like just noodling, so I don't want to do that just yet.",
    "Going here how you doing today, Marcel?",
    "You doing dude.",
    "Sentence was a mess, but I don't speak English as a first language, neither do I.",
    "Well, I do, but.",
    "I just don't have an excuse.",
    "I have no excuse.",
    "I was hoping that me lying would be.",
    "OK.",
    "It's OK in the year 2020.",
    "Just be a you know what.",
    "I'm going to steer clear of that comment and just continue on.",
    "What's a Derek today?",
    "I'm fine.",
    "Don't worry about it on the same totally fine.",
    "We could.",
    "Alright, no noodling so that dark value there aren't even.",
    "It's a little gradient right here.",
    "This is technically still noodling.",
    "OK, so.",
    "A little bit in here.",
    "Go up there.",
    "We can mode.",
    "It's good here dude.",
    "That's good to hear, man.",
    "There.",
    "Alright, so under here throats doing something.",
    "Upper lip Go even darker on this.",
    "Area.",
    "Go with that.",
    "Something like that.",
    "It's going on yeah the Behance.",
    "I don't know if, uh.",
    "If it's common knowledge, but Adobe Adobe owns Behance.",
    "Um?",
    "And I think, uh, because of a previous partner chip that we had back on Twitch that you reached out to me and a number of other.",
    "Streamers and asked if they wanted to.",
    "Have them work on their new streaming platform on their hands.",
    "Which is great and I said absolutely.",
    "For sure, so that's why you see me here.",
    "Uh.",
    "I think for at least at least a month, at the very least a month.",
    "And I think they're just trying to workout the Kinks trying to.",
    "Make sure that.",
    "It's in beta, right?",
    "It's still in beta.",
    "But they want to workout the kinks so they're getting.",
    "As professional artists and Streamers.",
    "To help him out.",
    "With that and.",
    "You know there is.",
    "There is a partnership.",
    "Papers have been signed.",
    "Um?",
    "But with that said, I'm still.",
    "All about it, absolutely not a problem.",
    "So what you're saying, Derek, is your shell?",
    "Yes, 100%, that's me.",
    "Yeah.",
    "No argument there.",
    "But Having said that, I do plan on the plan was before all.",
    "All hell broke loose.",
    "On this on this planet of ours.",
    "I was planning on going back to stream on Twitch.",
    "Um?",
    "There's a delay in that is going to be a delay in that.",
    "Like I was talking about earlier scheduling.",
    "My work schedule.",
    "Things that I currently.",
    "Have to finish and have to start and.",
    "Blah blah blah.",
    "And then once all that's all settled, I will be.",
    "Working on moving my setup.",
    "Into another room.",
    "An streaming from there.",
    "Right now it's.",
    "Caroline, my girlfriend works from home as well.",
    "This is not my normal screen stream stream time slot.",
    "Usually I stream early in the mornings.",
    "Over on Twitch.",
    "I haven't streamed in, I think like a year and a half, honestly.",
    "But I always always kind of planned on.",
    "Returning And like I said before.",
    "For all this Corona, all the Cove it.",
    "Go ahead, say it like that.",
    "I was planning on.",
    "Going back to streaming and getting.",
    "Internet put into that spare room.",
    "You know?",
    "But don't know.",
    "I don't know if I could still do that right now.",
    "Like I don't.",
    "I don't feel comfortable enough.",
    "Doing Like drilling into my walls and running CAT5 wire and.",
    "Getting all set up for the Internet and other rooms.",
    "I don't, I don't trust myself to do that.",
    "It's just not.",
    "It's just not something I've.",
    "You know, I'm not a handyman.",
    "I could do certain things.",
    "You know, like I can hang paintings and change light bulbs.",
    "You know I can do that kind of stuff.",
    "But when it comes to like.",
    "I don't know, just whatever you would have to do for.",
    "Setting up Internet into another room that's wired wired Internet right?",
    "I don't.",
    "I don't think why Pfizer Reliable.",
    "Way to stream online.",
    "So anyways.",
    "Flattering, that's the plan.",
    "Here in the weeks to come to get that set up.",
    "Alright, so I'm kind of going to like mid tone values now.",
    "Hum.",
    "So yeah, man.",
    "So Christian, you'll catch me here every Thursday and Friday.",
    "Starting when.",
    "40 minutes ago.",
    "And will be gone for three hours.",
    "Each day, there's name Friday every Thursday and Friday from here on out until Adobe realizes what they've done.",
    "By hiring me.",
    "To help promote their new platform.",
    "But don't tell him.",
    "Don't tell 'em yet.",
    "Let me get a couple weeks in and then you guys can break the news.",
    "This Derek I.",
    "I don't, I don't trust him.",
    "Got a beard now I don't think that's even real.",
    "Yeah wife, we wouldn't cut it for upload.",
    "Is is why?",
    "And we have we have dead zones in our house.",
    "Especially on that side of the house, like the Wi-Fi will just randomly drop from.",
    "For no reason, like if I brought in my PS4.",
    "Into the bedroom and use the TV in there and play the video games online.",
    "I would just lose connection so.",
    "I just rather have.",
    "To be wired in, you know what I'm saying.",
    "It sounds about right.",
    "I think beginning of 2019 was the last dream I think so, like in February 2018, so it feels like it's been awhile.",
    "It feels like it's been a long time so.",
    "So I think I'm going to grab this brush here like very.",
    "First brush their.",
    "Not my very first brush but.",
    "My brush brush that there.",
    "It's got a little bit of a chalky kind of.",
    "Texture actually you know what?",
    "I'm gonna use.",
    "I'm gonna use.",
    "This one instead, which is still kind of like a chunky.",
    "Yeah, that's a little bit more grit.",
    "To it.",
    "How's the?",
    "How's the volumes guys?",
    "Am I loud?",
    "Is the music too loud?",
    "Can you hear it for half the vad of yesterday's stream?",
    "There's no music and I was like, Oh Man.",
    "It's good timing on that when that song stopped and you guys didn't hear anything guys just just you are totally OK with letting me look like a complete idiot.",
    "Which I can't blame you.",
    "So good work.",
    "Uh, the OG PS fours don't have dual band, so interference is an issue.",
    "Yeah absolutely.",
    "Yeah, so that's why being wired in is is always better right?",
    "And even then the PSN.",
    "Download rates are just garbage anyways.",
    "I hope that they have something a little bit better.",
    "They probably won't for PS5.",
    "We'll see.",
    "Unless they've already released that information.",
    "Which I don't think I'll be jumping on board.",
    "I don't think I'll be an early buyer.",
    "And I wasn't for the PS4 neither.",
    "Um?",
    "I didn't buy it as soon as they came out.",
    "Um?",
    "'cause of PC games?",
    "I think I don't know.",
    "I just.",
    "I spent I spent way more time gaming on my PC.",
    "Gonna do my consoles.",
    "Having said that, I still do want to PS five it's, I think at some point.",
    "I have no plans on getting an Xbox.",
    "I don't own a.",
    "What are they called now?",
    "The current ones?",
    "Whatever, it doesn't really matter, but.",
    "I guess I'd still like an insult and like insulting.",
    "Insulting people who I'm not.",
    "I'm not I really don't mean Oh, Oh God, I don't mean to insult anybody.",
    "Who's button?",
    "An Xbox, but I mean even though you did waste your money.",
    "No offense to you, right?",
    "Yikes, I thought Derek was a nice guy.",
    "What happened?",
    "Hum.",
    "I know the new ones are called like X series or something like that.",
    "But I can't remember the call now.",
    "Xbox One.",
    "Yeah, that's what it's called, right?",
    "It's called it's called Xbox One.",
    "And then the new ones coming out RX.",
    "X series is that it's just called X Series.",
    "It's I don't know, it's weird.",
    "I like what Sony does and they just had the next number.",
    "Very straightforward.",
    "Easy for idiots like me to figure out.",
    "That the better one you know.",
    "I buy this one now.",
    "Here's my money.",
    "You know it's got an SS drive in there, which I don't know the specs of.",
    "the Xbox One, I'm assuming that's something they're going to add to.",
    "All this technology is already in my current computer going to be adding to their.",
    "Their next Gen.",
    "And that's not that's not everybody you know, not everybody relies on their PC and needs to have it upgraded.",
    "'cause it's what you do.",
    "You know, I use this computer.",
    "Every single day for work, right?",
    "So I guess from my standpoint it would make sense that I would need to have a rig.",
    "That is.",
    "You know it's got some.",
    "It's got some meat to it, right?",
    "It's got some muscles.",
    "To it, I don't know if it's.",
    "That makes sense, but.",
    "Hum.",
    "It's a good computer, right?",
    "So I can.",
    "I can probably.",
    "I can probably wait a bit.",
    "If you know, I know there's definitely going to be Sony exclusives that all want to jump on.",
    "I think that's right.",
    "I think bloodborne yeah it was.",
    "I think when bloodborne came out and I think that's when I picked up a PS4 'cause if there's if there's anything from Fromsoft That's exclusive to a console, I'll go ahead and justify that 'cause those games are just.",
    "The type of games that I absolutely love.",
    "You know, I don't know if Eldon Ring is going to be exclusive.",
    "2.",
    "Sony I don't think so right.",
    "I don't think it is.",
    "I think.",
    "Think elder rings basically going to be there next Dark Souls, so it's going to be for all platforms all.",
    "All gaming things.",
    "Uh.",
    "You can faintly hear the music.",
    "How's that?",
    "Can you hear it now?",
    "Myself, or is it still really low?",
    "That's probably better right there.",
    "But you can still hear me.",
    "Can you hear me like at the Level I'm speaking out right now over?",
    "Over the music.",
    "I've got a boost from my Wi-Fi.",
    "It helps like I got something that you plug it into the wall.",
    "Is that what you're talking about?",
    "Like I plugged I have this thing plugged in the wall.",
    "I have a cord going to it and then in our bedroom.",
    "And I know that you can get ones that are literally just Wi-Fi adapters that you plug into the wall, but I had I have an old.",
    "Router that's a fairly good one.",
    "Um?",
    "So I just got the ones that have the CAT5.",
    "Slight in them and just plug into them.",
    "So this one goes.",
    "To our living room sorry our bedroom from the living room and then goes into a router and then that's what blast continues blasting out the.",
    "And the Wi-Fi signal.",
    "I don't know why is it blasting out?",
    "I'm at the perfect level cake, cool.",
    "No, that's totally fine.",
    "And still be fine.",
    "Um?",
    "Yeah, absolutely what you said earlier there.",
    "Marcel, why buy the console when there's no?",
    "Games now I'm saying.",
    "Yeah.",
    "I know I'm saying or what your gnome saying.",
    "Every Granny in her dog or on the Internet.",
    "this Friday evening I have to watch 160P.",
    "And it still buffers from time to time, like here Christian like on Behance.",
    "Do you live is up 'cause you live in a?",
    "Like I congested area that has a lot of people living there, apartment building type of thing.",
    "A lot of interference with Wi-Fi signal.",
    "Can you pick up the data?",
    "Final cool?",
    "I'll check that out later.",
    "Yeah, I didn't know about these things.",
    "The basically uses your.",
    "Your power lines, right?",
    "It's just plugged right into the wall.",
    "Where you normally use, you know appliances or charger phone.",
    "Whatever you can, you can plug your Internet into that.",
    "It will travel through your power cords and then as long as it's connected to the same circuit, you can put another adapter into an outlet.",
    "And then have Wi-Fi and in a different part of your house where you have like a dead dead zone.",
    "Or I think that's what they call right dead zones.",
    "Basically you have garbage, Internet, garbage, Wi-Fi and it fixes it up just like instantly.",
    "The only downside of our setup that we have right now is you literally have to change your Wi-Fi setting on your phone or your iPad or computer.",
    "If it's not automatically already picking it up.",
    "I think Android 'cause I have an iPhone iPads.",
    "I think androids they automatically released you can set.",
    "Certain signals to, if this ones stronger, go to this one.",
    "I thought that you could do that with iPhones, but sometimes still uses the Wi-Fi out here, even though it has like less bars.",
    "Then the three bars that are in the bedroom.",
    "So and again, that's that's that's above my pay grade to figure out that stuff.",
    "I don't.",
    "I'm just happy that I got Wi-Fi in there working right.",
    "That's that's.",
    "A job well down in my books for me.",
    "You know, I'm not.",
    "I think when I was younger I was a little bit more on top of things, you know.",
    "But I was mainly for.",
    "I don't know if I should even saying this finding.",
    "Let me let me find the words.",
    "Playing, playing computer games, and like early like PS1 games.",
    "And having other means of.",
    "Getting those games.",
    "And it.",
    "And I value that is.",
    "0 value $0.00.",
    "I think that's ambiguous enough for you guys.",
    "Understand what I'm trying to say.",
    "I used to be able to do that stuff.",
    "Like Softmodding, I think I can say that.",
    "Like I was all about that like with my had a PSP that I could that was an emulator.",
    "I guess I basically just outed myself right there.",
    "You know, I'm saying.",
    "I think I'm on the wrong layer.",
    "Yeah, so I'm now painting literally on top of my.",
    "Line layer.",
    "So at this point, should I might as well just merge everything right at least two layers together?",
    "Whatever, let's do that.",
    "Yeah, so I was.",
    "I was a little bit into.",
    "Would you call that like computer engineering of some sort?",
    "Like a teaspoon of Computer Engineering Engineering?",
    "'cause I enjoyed it like I thought I thought doing that stuff is fun.",
    "Now it's you know, I guess our interests.",
    "Change in time, right as we get older.",
    "I much rather just.",
    "Save my money and wait until.",
    "Either the sale or if there's a game that I really want to get, then I'll just.",
    "I'll just.",
    "I'll just pay him or just buy it.",
    "I'll just buy the game.",
    "Especially with music nowadays too, there's if there's an album that I like an album I just bought recently, like a gunship got, we listen to a lot of gunship over on.",
    "On Twitch I'm really into just synth synth wave.",
    "You know?",
    "The Midnight Gunship.",
    "All all those other types of bands that I can't remember names of.",
    "You know I'll support them.",
    "I'll buy their albums back in the day.",
    "That was never something that came across my mind.",
    "Yeah, I guess I guess.",
    "Want it has to do with just having.",
    "Disposable income, and not that I really do right now, but.",
    "I can I can justify you know the 999 for an album that I'm going to get?",
    "How many playthroughs, playthroughs, playbacks?",
    "What do you call it like?",
    "You're going to listen to this album.",
    "More than $10 worth right?",
    "So it's it's easy to justify that.",
    "And you're supporting the artists, right?",
    "OK, I think I'm noodling, so I'm going to go ahead.",
    "Get back to the mid tones.",
    "And spacing here feels a little bit off.",
    "So we might have to stretch some things out, but for now.",
    "Just.",
    "It's just the Rona, the Rona Internet, yeah.",
    "Yeah, I guess everyone being home bandwidth are.",
    "It's disappointing and I guess like even even before the Rona, you know a lot of infrastructure for the Internet was.",
    "Pretty garbage tier, right?",
    "Now that we're all basically on it 24/7.",
    "I don't even think I haven't finished that thought 'cause It's.",
    "And less like there are.",
    "There's some countries out there.",
    "Like I don't really have too much issues.",
    "Where I am 'cause I think I think where I'm at I have fiber op and I would assume.",
    "I don't again, I don't know a whole lot about this kind of stuff, but I would assume that the stuff that they put in here is.",
    "Somewhat modern, you know.",
    "The technology.",
    "Probably not.",
    "It's probably running some old ancient.",
    "Wires.",
    "Uh.",
    "I have no idea.",
    "I can't.",
    "I can't say what it is, but.",
    "I don't really have too many issues.",
    "What do I have?",
    "I think I have 505 hundred down.",
    "That's what I have.",
    "And I need I need that stuff for for what I do for living, right?",
    "Hum.",
    "I'm happy with it.",
    "You know, I I could, it could be better.",
    "You know here about the price is that.",
    "Places in the EU.",
    "Have further Internet.",
    "And it's just like.",
    "It's like 1/4 of what we pay.",
    "I pay $130 for.",
    "My Internet, but it's bundled with corn.",
    "See, you gotta get the bundle.",
    "It's bundled with two PV Rs.",
    "One of them has a.",
    "Hard drive on it.",
    "I don't.",
    "We don't really watch TV.",
    "The girlfriend does a little bit from time to time.",
    "Hum.",
    "Because that's probably where I could save a little bit of money, right?",
    "Let's get that.",
    "I don't know, I just I just even hate the idea of.",
    "Picking up the phone to call the ISP right so ISPs are just never.",
    "Never just pick up the phone and you're good, right?",
    "So it's something not to complain to the people who are on the receiving end of the phone calls.",
    "You know they're just, they're just doing their job.",
    "I'll never, I'll never be an irate caller to a customer service representative.",
    "Mainly because I've been one, and I know I know.",
    "It's like just the.",
    "Braided right and you have to take it right?",
    "2 degree.",
    "Because the good calls were when you're you could say that if you continue to speak this way in this, this this town and I'll be forced to terminate the call.",
    "That's the worst that you could tell them, right?",
    "Mam if you get you swear at me, I'm going to have to terminate call.",
    "And that's That's it, and even then, I think there's some places where you can't even say that.",
    "Switch.",
    "Damn, you know.",
    "Could save a not knocking.",
    "People take calls it's well.",
    "I mean like I know that you do it and I know that my girlfriend does it.",
    "You know, I'm not going to be sitting here.",
    "Putting myself in the doghouse.",
    "But mostly it's because I've been there.",
    "You know, I worked.",
    "I worked for A.",
    "I was customer service representative for A.",
    "Oil company.",
    "For East Coast.",
    "US So like the New York area.",
    "New Jersey, Maryland, Massachusetts.",
    "That area.",
    "I did that for about a year.",
    "And it was.",
    "The worst thing ever.",
    "You go into working.",
    "You do your web 10 hour, 12 hour shift and there was always.",
    "Always a cube on the marquee that they had on the walls.",
    "Of at least like 100 people.",
    "Waiting in queue to talk to somebody.",
    "It was awful man.",
    "And it was some angry East Coast Americans.",
    "Wanting oil for their house for winter.",
    "Right?",
    "Yeah.",
    "Having said that, there were still some good times.",
    "That was when, uh, like.",
    "Now is when.",
    "The gameboy SP.",
    "I think there's like a gameboy advance, but it was foldable.",
    "The Gameboy SP is about this big in the unfolded it, so it had a hinge and I had a screen and normal button set up like a gameboy does.",
    "And I think the Final Fantasy, like the new Final Fantasy tactics.",
    "Came out I think is Final Fantasy tactics advance.",
    "I think that's what it was called.",
    "That came out an I put probably.",
    "Like 400 hours in that game, and I think that game alone kept me sane 'cause I could.",
    "I could hide my Gameboy SP 'cause they're small, right?",
    "And Final Fantasy games, specially tactics you can just.",
    "Put our you just lose hours of your life into schemes, so that's exactly what I wanted to do when I was at work.",
    "Just somehow Fast forward.",
    "Do that.",
    "And that's how I paid for Community College.",
    "That's how I was able to afford.",
    "Going to.",
    "Animation school.",
    "Course animation course I guess is what I should say.",
    "Going through that.",
    "You know?",
    "I think I was talking with someone else, but let's turn to thought.",
    "Soft money is legit since you're just backing up games illegally owned.",
    "Yeah, that's what I was doing absolutely.",
    "Thank you for.",
    "Covering my but you got my back there myself.",
    "Hum.",
    "There, have you seen midnight gospel on Netflix yet?",
    "Please do if you haven't yet.",
    "I don't.",
    "The midnight got like is that the band, the midnight?",
    "Or is that?",
    "Is that something unrelated to?",
    "I haven't.",
    "I haven't seen that.",
    "I don't even know what that is.",
    "Do do tell if you don't mind.",
    "The documentary.",
    "What what did we watch we watched?",
    "Oh, the R.",
    "Kelly one.",
    "Which was.",
    "It was good, but there's a lot of like.",
    "When it comes to documentaries and just really awful things happening to people.",
    "It feels weird when they have all these like theatrical.",
    "Edits, do you know what I mean?",
    "Like when I say theatrical edits like adding in suspenseful music and crazy cuts and editing techniques like.",
    "Just like a document documentary should be information.",
    "And then having people who experienced whatever it is.",
    "Sharing their story, you know, reenactments with actors are fine.",
    "I think that I think those really helpful.",
    "But having a lot of.",
    "Like movie edits and sounds and effects and stuff like that, I don't think that I think that kind of makes the their story disingenuous in.",
    "You know, I'm saying it might not be on Canadian Netflix, OK?",
    "What VPN do you guys here?",
    "What VPN do you guys use?",
    "Nord is that the one that you guys like?",
    "Just asking for a friend.",
    "I hear good things with that one.",
    "Just something non related.",
    "Yeah, so that's that's the latest thing I think I watched on Netflix.",
    "What did I watch before that?",
    "I don't, I don't.",
    "I the Tiger, Man, Tiger King, Tiger Man, Tiger man, the Tiger man?",
    "Documentary.",
    "Which is fantastic.",
    "Absolutely loved it.",
    "Terrible people.",
    "My goodness, what a world we live in.",
    "Carole Baskin You know?",
    "Oh boy.",
    "OK, I don't want to.",
    "I just sampled some light value.",
    "I don't want to do that just yet, so let's let's keep going in with the mid tones.",
    "Darker values first.",
    "If this document has a star, wipe it, lost its own points, yeah?",
    "I don't think I don't think that R.",
    "Kelly one has that, but it's just like there's definitely points.",
    "In the documentary was like Oh Man, I like I don't have.",
    "Something happened with my.",
    "Emotions and feeling for these people going to these awful things when they added like thriller type music like like you're watching a thriller thriller movie.",
    "Like Suspenseful Music playing is probably what it would say in the subtitles, like I don't.",
    "I don't like 2 degree.",
    "Yeah, that's fine anyways.",
    "You guys watch it and maybe you'll know what I'm saying.",
    "We haven't already.",
    "It's still worth the watch.",
    "I'd say.",
    "Matt Kaiser If I could swear I would be right now.",
    "R.",
    "Kelly A predator right awful.",
    "OK, we are indeed noodling, so some of these shapes are a little.",
    "Monkey.",
    "Will do this.",

    "I think it's alright.",
    "I think it's alright.",
    "And I think the reason why it's alright.",
    "It's 'cause we took the time is his mandible.",
    "The jar looks like it's kind of.",
    "Pushed into far, his nose is pointing down a little bit too much.",
    "Hum.",
    "But I think it's fine.",

    "He controlled J.",
    "So what I did, I'll go over what I did.",
    "Real quick here, emerged everything into its own flat and layer right and then from there I continue to use the lasso tool and then probably one of the coolest things that somebody in the chat is told me to try out in photo shop from back in.",
    "That which days is control J hitting control and J together turns that selection.",
    "Into a new layer and not only does it turn into a new layer, a copy, paste, sit in the exact spot.",
    "Where do you select it, which might not sound like a big deal, but if you're a numbskull like me, I just said Numbskull.",
    "If you're a non still like me before I used to just do this control C control V right?",
    "And in this case it worked fine.",
    "It didn't paste it exactly in the right spot.",
    "Or did it?",
    "Yeah I did.",
    "It's just that's yeah, this is a rare case or it will put it.",
    "Where it will paste.",
    "In the right spot, usually it's kind of like off and just a just a little bit like that.",
    "And then you have to kind of painstakingly put in the right spot so when you hit CTRL J.",
    "It resolves that.",
    "Copy paste, issue.",
    "Anyways, control J and then next I'll take control T.",
    "I'm going to go at the top here.",
    "Click on this thing this will.",
    "Put these nine squares.",
    "On your selection, and it's basically like a mesh now, so I can kind of warp this.",
    "Right, so this is how you can get some crazy effects.",
    "But also get some subtle ones too like this.",
    "So if we just want that knows that go up just a little bit.",
    "We can do that.",
    "So basically just turns into.",
    "Really malleable.",
    "Play.",
    "And I'm looking at the cheeks.",
    "This chick is.",
    "Really really, really wide.",
    "So we might have to shave that a little bit.",

    "Yeah.",
    "I think I will.",
    "I'll do the same thing.",
    "This might be a little bit different though.",
    "I think I have to merge everything, so I'm going to just duplicate this for the sake of archiving or progress and emerged all of this together.",
    "And then make a selection.",
    "Right around here.",
    "You can go all the way up.",
    "Maybe not this, maybe we'll get this out.",
    "And then just try this control TV control H and.",
    "Capital.",
    "Camping Maybe something like that?",
    "Let's keep it.",
    "There still feels like it's not.",
    "Completely accurate, but again, like I said earlier and even yesterday, it's not always about the accuracy, it's about.",
    "Effectiveness I guess.",

    "Depending on the brushes, 'cause some brushes are a little bit more heavy handed.",

    "Uh.",

    "I like my Nana little bit lower side.",
    "That way I can slowly build up right.",
    "It allows you to build up your value, so even though you have maybe let's say you have a darker value selected, it doesn't necessarily mean that when you put down a brushstroke, it's going to be that value, right?",

    "Just don't do that anymore, and I think I should be fine.",
    "But not do that.",
    "I mean start drawing eyelids.",
    "So maybe that's something that we can probably do.",
    "One of these weeks is worked on.",
    "Eyes.",
    "Faces in general man just like just faces.",
    "We can probably do a couple of exercises where we I think I've done this in the past where we Draw Something from reference and then we try and draw it again from memory.",
    "I think that's always a good exercise.",
    "And probably one of the better ones, the stream.",
    "I'm going to make a clipping mask here.",
    "OK.",
    "This might be a bit cringe, but I have Mr.",
    "Stream Derek.",
    "It's nice to catch up.",
    "That's not cringe at all, man.",
    "I honestly I really miss streaming.",
    "As well, man like it's we need.",
    "It was such a part of my life that.",
    "You know, if it was weird not streaming all the time, it really was.",
    "You know, and I plan on changing that for sure.",
    "With that said, I still it wasn't always feeling weird.",
    "There's there's times when.",
    "You know, I.",
    "I needed to focus, you know, I need to focus on.",
    "Put in the work out there.",
    "And there definitely is something to be said about streaming and.",
    "Being effective and painting at your best level and when I'm when I'm streaming, I definitely not.",
    "You know, 'cause I consistently distracting myself.",
    "You know when I'm painting, I wish I was able to do this.",
    "I wish I was able to just like speak and completely focus on what I'm working on.",
    "But it's just it's so difficult to do.",
    "Which is why I would throw in some focus streams right back in the day where I would just literally.",
    "Not speak and not have a camera and just focus on the painting.",
    "And while I was doing that I was broadcasting my canvas.",
    "Um?",
    "I mean, those are still, I think that maybe not necessarily when I do it, but there's still some valuable.",
    "Some value that can be.",
    "Like that?",
    "It's not just a waste of data being sent out into the Internet.",
    "But that was, you know, that's the truth of it is that I'm not as efficient, and I'm not as effective.",
    "At painting.",
    "On stream as I am when I'm not right, I think that I think that makes sense.",
    "You know that wouldn't take much time to convince somebody that that makes sense.",
    "But I certainly enjoy streaming man.",
    "It's very therapeutic.",
    "You know, especially for somebody, especially during these times, you know it's so strange too.",
    "To have basically everybody now understands what it's like to work at home consistently.",
    "Yeah, it's awesome.",
    "It's great, but the novelty will wear out right?",
    "And you'll start to kind of go a little bit crazy.",
    "And I don't have very many people to kind of hang out with.",
    "And you know, I'm in that age that demographic age were people are focusing on their careers focusing on the families you know, getting a home.",
    "All these things like that that are very adult orientated.",
    "Totally justifiable over spending time with anybody else, right?",
    "I'm the same way I have certain things that I just need to focus on and some sacrifices that have to be made.",
    "You know, spending time with friends, you know family.",
    "All that stuff is kind of like a sacrifice to trying to get a little bit of progress on.",
    "On your art or whatever it is you're trying to work on, you know.",
    "So now with what's going on in the world, it's kind of like everyone.",
    "It's funny 'cause they're living literally my lifestyle.",
    "And they have no choice.",

    "Hum.",
    "I think I was going somewhere with it, but again, train of thought.",
    "Evaporated.",
    "Nothing.",
    "Yeah, absolutely.",
    "I think this is this is kind of what we have to do anyways when it comes to.",
    "The current situation raises a lot of people are discovering discord and a lot of people are discovering streams and they're using zoom or whatever application.",

    "IRL You know it's.",
    "It was different ways to.",
    "Spend time with your friends and family.",
    "I still consider that you know hanging out.",
    "From people just hanging out in a voice call to people visiting each other and Animal Crossing, and I'm spending time with your friends.",
    "In a game world.",
    "It might not be the real thing you know, like actually hanging out with somebody, but you can certainly.",
    "Do a good job in.",
    "Come on.",
    "Hitting that spot right?",
    "Maybe that's not the best way to put it.",
    "You know?",
    "A temporary substitute.",
    "For the real thing.",
    "But I can honestly take her to leave it.",
    "Because people are awful.",
    "The rule in terms of the real world, right?",
    "Going outside is the worst.",
    "And now it literally is.",
    "So like my lifestyle is completely justified.",
    "During all this.",
    "And.",
    "I don't know if it's a good thing or not.",
    "That's something to be proud of.",

    "I do at home, right?",
    "I like just to.",
    "There's a game that I'm playing, I'll play that and then have have a stream open and that's kind of it if I'm not doing that, then I'm watching movies.",
    "Hang out with the girlfriend on the couch, right?",
    "If I'm not doing that, and if I do decide to go outside, it's probably to walk the dog right?",
    "And that's kind of it.",
    "Very very basic, very simple stuff.",
    "But I'm extremely content doing those things.",
    "You barely get what he's doing right now like what I'm doing right here.",
    "Are you talking about me myself?",
    "Right now I'm still just like Noodling and what that means is.",
    "You know, I'm kind of jumping all over the place and just kind of.",
    "Trying trying to make things a little bit more correct and accurate.",
    "And applying a little bit more value.",
    "Painting a little bit more where I think needs to be painted a little bit more.",
    "Well, still trying to maintain a sense of.",
    "Form right sense of that?",
    "3D.",
    "Feeling.",
    "Even though this is on a 2D surface.",
    "Using the values.",
    "To create that.",
    "Optical illusion that it's 3D.",
    "Yes, I am in position.",
    "I guess we are right.",
    "I think it's valid to be a little bit darker.",
    "I don't know, maybe all of it can be a little bit darker.",
    "I don't know how I feel about that.",
    "Let's go back, actually pretty here.",
    "Yeah.",
    "What's up, moose?",
    "How you doing, man?",
    "I hope you have a Good Friday.",
    "Please get this stretch out, oh.",
    "I encourage you guys to stretch is well, all is so good.",
    "The risk going right?",
    "Oh But it means I get the concept, but the execution seems bananas to me.",
    "I can understand that.",
    "Yeah, I mean like.",
    "Anything, anything that's, uh.",
    "You know?",
    "Viewed Without Practice, I guess, like if you haven't done this and you haven't practiced in your scene for the first time.",
    "Yeah, I can actually get.",
    "Why would?",
    "Boggle the brain.",
    "But at the same time I don't think it's necessarily appropriate for me to reply like going, oh it's easy.",
    "You know, like This Is, This is a skill that takes time to develop.",
    "As you are well aware.",
    "You know?",
    "It's kind of like how can I?",
    "How can I put this?",
    "Marcels musician, so I'd say it's kind of like being able to.",
    "How you would learn a new song?",
    "You would.",
    "See the chords person who's never played guitar.",
    "Or any other musician or musical instrument you know for you.",
    "You can be told what the chords are in like OK then, then you kind of figure it out and this is how the summer sale plays guitar.",
    "He only has a really small miniature guitar.",
    "You know he plays it mirrored as well.",
    "This is mirrored.",
    "Now we just do that, but he most likely would be able to play it pretty quickly and learn how to play it pretty quickly.",
    "Compared to somebody who just literally picking up the guitar for the first time, you know, and that's I guess I already know what the chords are.",
    "For this example, which is an awful example.",
    "I was trying Marcel, I'm trying.",
    "Comparative type things.",
    "Alright, so I think we'll start adding a little bit this lighter value.",
    "In here.",
    "Another way to add this lighter value with beach it.",
    "Slap on like an overlay layer.",
    "I think we're going to do that too.",
    "So now I'm kind of just relying on the texture of this brush.",
    "Right like this brush right here if I just.",
    "Bob Ross is, you know, literally just kind of.",
    "Capital.",
    "You know it's it's kind of nice texture which can be used for anything.",
    "You can use.",
    "This brush itself is so versatile.",
    "You know when you actually just trying to render with it, it creates a nice kind of buildup of paint that is really appealing.",
    "But also, when like I said, when you kind of.",
    "T app it creates this nice texture as well.",
    "So I'm going to take advantage of that with this brush.",
    "And hopefully.",
    "Make it feel like this is made out of stone.",
    "Whatever this material is.",
    "Yeah, like this island feels too small.",
    "Probably flip it back to.",
    "It took you 4 hours ago into the office man.",
    "Now is that because of like?",
    "Certain security put in place.",
    "Or is that a combination of that and like distance just time to get to the office?",
    "Either way, like being outside right now is.",
    "You know?",
    "Not a place where I would.",
    "Wanna spend too much time?",
    "I mean, that's.",
    "Even when it's not an epidemic.",
    "Outside's awful.",
    "I'm sure I'm going to be really excited.",
    "Happy to spend some time outside.",
    "When deemed appropriate.",
    "In two hours.",
    "Now.",
    "Oh, that's right.",
    "Yeah, you doing a lot of.",
    "Ascend stuff, yeah, that's right.",
    "Uh.",
    "Audio, Covent of what you're doing right now, right?",
    "Yeah, so it's it's a language, right like?",
    "Understanding my eyes are so used to seeing certain values right in being able to kind of take things apart when I look at them on like I can, I can literally turn them into.",
    "A pliable pieces right?",
    "I can separate them in layers in my own head, and that's how Photoshop Photoshop can easily work that way as well.",
    "So.",
    "You know, if you're able to listen to a song, you can kind of.",
    "If you have a good ear, I guess in this case actually that's a really good.",
    "That's literally what I'm doing is like.",
    "This is the song, you know, the references, the song.",
    "If I'm hearing it for the first time, I'm seeing this for the first time, or at least sitting down to do a reference of it or study of it.",
    "You know you can kind of listen.",
    "See what chord progression is the strum pattern.",
    "And I guess that would be an exercise for the ear.",
    "You know this is more or less an exercise for the eye.",
    "Is it there?",
    "Oh, shower painting is.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Yes, it is obnoxious voice.",
    "I just made up.",
    "To represent somebody I don't know who.",
    "Hum.",
    "The song with this I that's like really funky.",
    "This is this is that detective work right?",
    "No paintings.",
    "Even if it is a study, it's just kind of literally, you're just trying to solve a mystery as to why it doesn't look correct.",
    "Or to make it more appealing or something along those lines.",
    "Yeah, it looks really strange.",
    "And so you just keep keep working on it, right?",
    "Sometimes just painting over it, starting from scratch is.",
    "The best way to go.",
    "Sometimes you sticking with it, maybe even taking a break, right?",
    "You can either start painting some another another area of your painting, come back to this area.",
    "You know little bit later or literally, put the painting away and.",
    "Get up and walk around.",
    "I find that that taking actual brakes.",
    "There's a lot of benefit in that.",
    "Yeah, this feels like I'm trying too hard to match things where it's just getting.",
    "It's becoming flat.",
    "Which is the exact opposite of one trying to do.",
    "Travel OK, so the time to actually travel with security stuff.",
    "Waiting for tech support to arrive and then my computer operating system needed an update at the worst possible time.",
    "Yikes.",
    "I can hear a squirrel fart across the street.",
    "I could put a multiply layer on this in darkened areas, but also literally do what I just did there and stay on the same layer and just with as long as I'm using a value that's darker than.",
    "Value that I'm painting over.",
    "That will therefore make everything darker.",
    "So I could do something like that.",
    "Right?",
    "I think we'll just keep that.",
    "It might be a little bit too dark, but.",
    "Just payment of this anyways.",
    "OK, so I think what I will do to add in.",
    "The brightness to add in the lighter values is I'll make a new layer, hold alt between these two layers so it clips on as well.",
    "'cause we can add as many layers.",
    "You know as we want.",
    "Onto the same base here, right?",
    "So this is still their base.",
    "This one right here where it used to look.",
    "Used to look like that, right?",
    "That's our base now.",
    "We're painting on top of that, so let's turn this into.",
    "I wanted to add a overlay.",
    "Layer here and.",
    "Paint on some white.",
    "The broad kind of brush.",
    "We might have to use like a software, and I think this might be fine.",
    "So.",
    "So I see a lot of value, light getting kind of trap right here.",
    "That's that's another thing about doing, you know, studies from life.",
    "Photos I guess.",
    "Of things from life is you start to recognize.",
    "Patterns that light.",
    "Especially in the face, right?",
    "Were light will tend to always hit.",
    "And the more that you study it right, the more that you can apply that.",
    "To your own work.",
    "Hopefully.",
    "Much tool.",
    "Yeah, don't you make it harder for yourself by not making the background light as well.",
    "I know well, so here's why I don't have the background white is because it's too intense for my eyes.",
    "That's literally it.",
    "It's just too much white shining on my eyes.",
    "It just starts to irritate them.",
    "You know?",
    "That's I think that's literally it.",
    "And at the end of it, I probably will.",
    "Add a layer that is black and white.",
    "And even even just having like a Gray or black, it's to compare.",
    "Your values to see if you're accurate or not, right?",
    "But that's Why.",
    "That's the only reason why I have.",
    "This tinted background is so it's not as intense.",
    "With the backlight.",
    "Of my display.",
    "OK, so that's This is literally what we just did.",
    "I think I will.",
    "Keep messing around on this layer though.",
    "This song is the absolute worst song.",
    "Oh Man, I'm going to change it.",
    "Let me get outta here.",
    "There we go.",
    "It sounds better.",
    "If you pop a cheekbone a little, give him sneak your eyes.",
    "It's like his hair back.",
    "You look like Grand Moff Tarkin.",
    "I have that sounds like something from Star Wars.",
    "That's something from Star Wars.",
    "When is that?",
    "Yeah, I'm starting to see that the noses.",
    "Maybe it needs to be a little bit wider.",
    "I think.",
    "I think we'll take this.",
    "Put it up here and hide that one.",
    "Merge this together so this becomes a new base.",
    "And.",
    "Try and.",
    "Move some of these features around.",
    "I don't know.",
    "Maybe if we did this.",
    "I don't know if that was a good idea or not, see.",
    "No.",
    "And again I need to.",
    "Remind myself.",
    "That the primary objective isn't 100 cent likeness rights not 100% accuracy.",
    "It's it's being able to see what I want out of.",
    "This is being able to understand or get a better understanding or to learn a little bit more about lighting.",
    "Right?",
    "I think I still will.",
    "Trying this wrong with this knows a little bit.",
    "Let's see if that's a good selection, so let's just go CTRL J again, control T.",
    "Hold down control.",
    "Try to move this.",
    "A little bit.",
    "You can't, you know.",
    "He kind of looks like.",
    "Kind of looks like a.",
    "Does this new show that I've been watching?",
    "Try and watch it at least sometimes.",
    "It's hard to hard to stomach, it's called.",
    "What is it called?",
    "White House press conference this is great.",
    "I think it's fictional.",
    "Seems like it's fictional show that happens.",
    "I think it is right around now.",
    "Is a character called font foshee.",
    "Douchy is a doctor, doctor felt.",
    "She kind of looks like him a little bit.",
    "You know if cut the hair back a little bit, probably look like him.",
    "That's really kind of reminds me of.",
    "Anyway, that shows not for everybody.",
    "No, mainly just the benefit certain to.",
    "Demographic.",
    "No, I'm just going to stop right here.",
    "So let's stop this, I'm just going to stop talking.",
    "Yeah.",
    "I'm just gonna not say anything else, I'll man.",
    "What Star Wars?",
    "OK, I think actually did a painting of that guy once.",
    "Is he talking about?",
    "He's in like a bunch of horror movies, right?",
    "Old school horror movies.",
    "OK.",
    "Let's see if we can correct this.",
    "Let's see that.",
    "I think that would be a little bit too.",
    "Now I think we need to move the lip or.",
    "Yeah, I feel like I like the nose now.",
    "I like I like the nose now.",
    "Now the bottom lips looking weird A.",
    "Running out of shows to watch.",
    "I think that's I think that's it.",
    "I think it's literally what's happening.",
    "Tales from the loop.",
    "Re watch Galaxy Quest making making of documentary.",
    "See, that sounds really familiar.",
    "Galaxy quest I don't think I've seen that, let alone the documentary of the making of.",
    "But it sounds really familiar moves.",
    "Um?",
    "Yeah.",
    "OK.",
    "It's like I think it's probably.",
    "Fair to say that at this point it's basically just all about jumping around.",
    "From one area to the next, and.",
    "Back again.",
    "I'm not consistently staying too long.",
    "At any particular area.",
    "I don't know, maybe maybe there's more benefit in doing that.",
    "Maybe I should say in an area to finish, but the reason for me?",
    "That way I justify.",
    "Is.",
    "You don't want to push something too far, and then when you go to another area of your study of your painting.",
    "In comparatively.",
    "What you just finished working on makes everything else look out of whack.",
    "I think the likelihood of that happening if you just focus on one area is fairly high.",
    "Over.",
    "You know, just kind of jumping around, but I don't know that's.",
    "That's the great thing about.",
    "Art and painting and learning is that what might work for me doesn't always necessarily.",
    "I mean, it's the only way.",
    "To do it right.",
    "I thought like Beastie Boys was going to play for a second there.",
    "You Will it happen?",

    "Galaxy quest was one of the movies was the movie about actors of a sci-fi show that were taken into space by real aliens who thought the show was real.",
    "Wow, yeah no.",
    "I haven't seen that.",
    "I don't think I've even heard of it.",
    "That sounds crazy.",
    "What a wild concept.",
    "What did I see it?",
    "I don't know.",
    "I think it's just 'cause it's got the word quest.",
    "On the end of it, and.",
    "So many titles, video games and TV shows, movies, whatever.",
    "That share that?",
    "Maybe that's what my brains.",
    "Telling me.",

    "Communicate with your devices without having to touch them.",
    "You know, like that sounds cool, but like our reality is so awful.",
    "That is not going to go that way.",
    "It's probably not going to go that way.",
    "You know, I don't.",
    "I don't think I want to be the first.",
    "I don't know, maybe maybe I don't know.",
    "It really depends.",

    "This?",
    "Unrealistic, hyper hypothetical example?",
