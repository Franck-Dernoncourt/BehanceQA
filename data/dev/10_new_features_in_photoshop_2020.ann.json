    "That should do it, OK great.",
    "Allow it to less buttons to press OK now we should be live everywhere.",
    "So let's just close this one.",
    "And click on this one looks like read a bunch of people here waiting.",
    "Uh so without further ado, let's go ahead and dive into the what's new in photo shop sorry again for the brief delay getting?",
    "Up and running here.",
    "But this was.",
    "A time change that I wasn't wasn't originally going to do so.",
    "I was really going to do 4:00 o'clock.",
    "The rumors Wednesday, which I normally do 3:00 o'clock, but it was after 3:00 o'clock so it's like.",
    "Oh, crap, I gotta do it now.",
    "Alright so with that, said, Welcome Everyone, Hello, Victoria, Bernice Deb great to see you as well.",
    "Great to see everyone here.",
    "I'm streaming everywhere so this should be on.",
    "This should be live on Facebook.",
    "It should be live on YouTube.",
    "It should be live on be hands.",
    "It should be live on a linked end it should be live.",
    "Everywhere.",
    "And Speaking of Twitter.",
    "Let's do one more get it live on Twitter and then this will be the biggest multicast I've ever done.",
    "Alright Here we go one last step here.",
    "And settings.",
    "And we're up and running there and.",
    "Here we go.",
    "Running right down.",
    "Pictures in Photoshop and then we can start some photo shop love.",
    "Photo shop loufest.",
    "All right.",
    "OK.",
    "That's it, OK, so back to you.",
    "So what I love to do is take you through not only what I showed in the keynote but.",
    "Also, some of the things I showed.",
    "That are that weren't in the keynote that I didn't have.",
    "The opportunity to show so let's start on my computer will switch over to the desktop.",
    "And I've got my computer up and running I will be showing some of the same images that I used in the keynote so but will go a little bit deeper cousin, the keynote.",
    "I literally only have like 7 minutes in the Max keynote to show everything.",
    "And that's why I couldn't show everything so we're going to see some features that I didn't get a chance to show.",
    "Go a little bit deeper on the ones I did get a chance to show an we'll go from there.",
    "Alright so with that, said.",
    "Let's start off with an enhancement to a feature that I introduced actually last year.",
    "So one of the features I introduced last year was the fact that you did not need to hold down the shift key.",
    "Anymore to do free transform to perform a free transform and have it be proportional because that was the reason you were holding down the shift key.",
    "In the 1st place all these years.",
    "But what if you didn't have to do it that way anymore.",
    "Well, that was great for Maine and a lot of people but some people like didn't like that so.",
    "The team you know within the last few months, actually introduced a preference where you could go into preferences and turn it off say no.",
    "I like the old behavior go back to the way it was that's the way I always liked it.",
    "Don't change things on me just just keep it going, the way it was.",
    "And that's great you can turn it off in the preferences, but what if you like it.",
    "Sometimes.",
    "And you don't like it.",
    "Other times, maybe there are times where you don't want it on and there are times where you do want it on instead of having to go switch the preference every time now, it's.",
    "A It's a toggleable toggleable is that a word.",
    "I think you can toggle in the control panel so I'm going to free transform.",
    "And there's a little link symbol.",
    "It's always been there, but now the maintain aspect ratio is sticky So what that means is while that is.",
    "Is enabled when I do a free transform?",
    "Yeah, what I do every transport there, we go.",
    "It scales, it and when I uncheck that it stretches it.",
    "OK, just like it is always done, but the difference now is that if I leave that unchecked.",
    "It stays unchecked until I check it going again, so for people that say, Nope turn that off turn it off.",
    "Just uncheck that and it will never you will always have to hold down the shift key so when it's enabled.",
    "As you might guess the shift key, then does the opposite so the shift key stretches on hold down the shift key now?",
    "And without the shift key I get a regular transform OK, so again.",
    "I'm going to undo that and go back to it, so that's the first new thing is that this new.",
    "For maintain aspect ratio is now you know it's now consistent stays sticky.",
    "It stays on or off depending on what you do.",
    "And Secondly the other big thing or the big problem with this in the past was.",
    "That.",
    "Even when this feature was first introduced forget whether you like it or not.",
    "Uh it wasn't consistent meaning that on pixel layers.",
    "You didn't have to hold down the shift key.",
    "But on vector layers.",
    "You did, have to hold on to 50 and it was just like.",
    "Even with it on there wasn't consistent so now the team is made it.",
    "More consistent across the across the board and you get to control.",
    "It just by clicking on that link symbol so that's feature number one.",
    "Feature #2 this is something I did showing in the keynote and it's the work capability so you have.",
    "Warp for quite awhile in photo shop, but the problem with it in the past before this update was that you always when you click warp.",
    "You got a grid on your transform you got a 3 by 3 square grid and that's all.",
    "You ever got you couldn't add more points couldn't take points away.",
    "You couldn't do anything could make a 4 by 4 grade couldn't do anything else.",
    "So now you get first of all when I turn it on, I don't get any grid because it's.",
    "Off by default.",
    "But you can now go back to the same 3 by 3 grid, You used to get or 4 by 4 grid.",
    "Or 5 by 5 grid or whatever if that's not enough.",
    "You can still go in and put in your own custom grid points.",
    "So I can just put in a point there and say, I need a point.",
    "Wherever I need it to be.",
    "I need a point there.",
    "I need as many points as I want where I want them and that's the big thing.",
    "All right, so the In addition to not only being able to create your own custom grid putting points in intersections wherever you need them to be.",
    "The other thing is that you can now hold down the shift key with the wire in this mode.",
    "An select multiple points now keep in mind, I have a point selected already So what may trip you up?",
    "Is that when you make that selection it will deselect the point you already had selected so don't forget to go back.",
    "And reselect those.",
    "So if you have point selected.",
    "That behavior should go back in and re select those so that I can warp that anyway, I want I can stretch it.",
    "I can make it wiggle.",
    "I forgot a couple points anyway, so I can go ahead and add those back in.",
    "Else has it there, we go so now those are selected even though they're not visually selected.",
    "It's selecting them all right there, we go.",
    "Area so I gotta mall select it now, I can do whatever I want with whatever part of this flower.",
    "Or object that I would want to do it with so that is the new warp capability in photo shop.",
    "Your own custom grid.",
    "Your own points wherever you want selecting multiple points by holding down the shift key remember to turn back on the ones you might have had.",
    "Already selected if they deselect.",
    "And.",
    "That is that I'm going to switch to a different.",
    "A different.",
    "A different image here, I was going to use a different image for the next one will see if I can find it real quick.",
    "Fairview this winter.",
    "OK so the Next One Up is the object select tool, so I did show this in the keynote as well.",
    "So there's a brand new tool, but I will mention a couple of things about it, so first of all.",
    "You may not see that tool.",
    "On photo shop if you customize your tool panel because when you customize your tool panel you're turning off tools you don't use.",
    "And new tools don't get added automatically so when I first installed a new version of Photoshop and it.",
    "It used my existing tools.",
    "The object select wasn't there, I had to come down to the bottom here and I could find it this way.",
    "It was in the list of tools that I had not.",
    "You know had not enabled yet, but if you go back up to your edit toolbar, then you can.",
    "Object select tool from the disabled tools over to your or inactive tools over to your tool panel wherever you want it to be.",
    "So, therefore, it is there from that point on, and then don't forget to save this as a preset so you can always load it back in.",
    "So what is the object select tool?",
    "The object select tool and people make jokes about this, but it's true seems like with every new version of Photoshop.",
    "There's a new way to make a selection and that's not a bad thing.",
    "Norway since elections are such an important part of photo shop.",
    "The more ways.",
    "You have to select something.",
    "The better so object select just one more way to make a selection.",
    "Um with that, said there are 2 modes for this tool that starts off in the rectangle, which I have selected at the Top here.",
    "And if I were to make a selection of let's say the bagel just half of the bagel.",
    "It uses Adobe Sensei Artificial Intelligence machine learning to figure out that even though I made a rectangular selection around that bagel.",
    "To select it says Oh you're trying to select the bagel I get it.",
    "If I were to make another rectangular selection around a tomato.",
    "It says Oh you want the tomato, I get it now.",
    "Of course, it's machine learning.",
    "AI based that doesn't mean it's going to get.",
    "Everything perfectly every single time.",
    "But it works, most of the time really well so for example, if I select this leaf well.",
    "It got belief, but it started to get a little bit of that.",
    "Salt or whatever that is next to it because it says Oh that looks like it's connected to it.",
    "I'll get that too, so again it.",
    "It's it's a AI based Adobe Sensei, based thing, so it will be as good as it could be.",
    "Now, if there is something more intricate you're trying to select you may want to switch over to the lasso like if you're trying to select things and not select other things, then you can switch over to the lasso version.",
    "Of that tool.",
    "And you can go in and make a selection.",
    "Around individual objects in again, um.",
    "The object select tool will make that selection, so if I was trying to select both of these leaves for example.",
    "I'm trying this before let's see what happens.",
    "It got both leaves and it made them as individual selections.",
    "It didn't select the space in between if I wanted to get both tomatoes.",
    "Using the lasso let me get both tomatoes so in a case where something is maybe too close to something.",
    "And you don't want it to accidentally pick that up to you get the lasso, especially with the Stylus.",
    "And you get the ability to go in an?",
    "Select just the objects you want so the new object select tool is freaking amazing.",
    "I can't wait to keep using that going forward.",
    "All right Next up?",
    "I'm going to close this one.",
    "And.",
    "That's The One I used before in the object select tool demo and a keynote the switch over to this one.",
    "All right this one's kind of cool this one kind of got snuck in an most people still don't know about this will talk about this one.",
    "And while it will look magical and it looked magical when I demo'd this into keynote.",
    "It's really simple.",
    "Let me explain what's going to happen, I'm going to switch over to the properties panel.",
    "And in the properties panel there's a new button called remove background.",
    "Oh my God, it's a button now it's that easy.",
    "First requirement and I didn't get a chance to say this in the keynote first requirement is that it cannot be on the background.",
    "It has to be a layer so.",
    "Either convert your background to a layer or greater layer so now that that's a layer says Layer 0.",
    "This button will appear in work So what is this doing when I click it.",
    "It does magic it?",
    "Gets rid of the background?",
    "Well, technically it didn't get.",
    "Rid of it.",
    "The background still there just masked it so that's great.",
    "It's even better that is non destructive.",
    "But what's it really doing.",
    "It's doing something you could have done all along and some of you were doing if you're just doing it manually all along.",
    "It did 2 things for me.",
    "It.",
    "You select subject to select the subject.",
    "And then it just it would be the equivalent of once that selections made if I held down the option or alt key and click.",
    "Make a mask.",
    "That's it 2 steps so it's just doing those 2 steps for you.",
    "It's making selection based on select or I'm sorry.",
    "Um.",
    "Yeah, select subject and it's masking it all in one button.",
    "That's it, so for example, if I go to the next photo 'cause again.",
    "Believing and will just make this a little bigger.",
    "It's on a layer so it'll work click remove background.",
    "2 steps in one button.",
    "Select subject.",
    "Create a mask.",
    "Done.",
    "So.",
    "That's what it's doing now.",
    "When does it work great it works great when selects subject would work great, so if you have a subject that selects subject and.",
    "Easily identify.",
    "Awesome you have a subject that select subject can't easily identify or doesn't select like her.",
    "Not going to be awesome because her would still require you to go and select and mask and mask out the hair.",
    "And then you'll be doing it that way, so in that case, it cannot.",
    "Go in and easilly do this depending on the image so someone's asking can I please tell you what resolution you're working on please?",
    "Well, I'm working on all the different all the images are different resolutions summer super big summers are web resolution.",
    "Some of these most of these are fairly large files from stock so they are all over the map.",
    "Just prints.",
    "OK Next up?",
    "Oh my God, remove background option came directly from the heavens above possibly but I think it was more.",
    "More like engineers in San Jose anyway.",
    "Let's go on.",
    "Now this next one this Speaking of resolution.",
    "This is a 5 gig file.",
    "It's a big file with literally hundreds of layers.",
    "Or at least dozens of layers, I don't know bout hundreds, but at least dozens.",
    "Anne what this feature is that I'm showing I just want to make sure I can just click on a couple of these yeah.",
    "OK, what this feature is is it's a new way to zoom so it would be.",
    "I think it's manually under the view menu perhaps.",
    "Yep, it's a new option called fit layers on screen.",
    "There is a keyboard equipped keyboard modifier and Click to do it.",
    "Without having to go up to the menu.",
    "So what it's doing is it's saying whatever layer you click on the thumbnail for.",
    "Uh I will zoom to that layer So what this is for?",
    "Is this beautiful image from Isabella May.",
    "Has dozens of not hundreds of layers?",
    "In it every little element is on its own layer an she?",
    "Didn't do a great job of naming the layers.",
    "They're like background copy background copy background copy.",
    "So I would have no idea what layer of this butterfly is on because it's not called butterfly or butterfly 20.",
    "'Cause there's a bunch of butterflies in here, I wouldn't know what layer what layer things are on So what this let's me do is OK.",
    "This first background copy.",
    "I've no idea what it is.",
    "Let's zoom to it, so hold down the option key click on the thumbnail.",
    "Oh, it's the Orange Flower.",
    "So now I could name that orange.",
    "Flower will say on the right because maybe it'll move but I could name that layer now OK great.",
    "What's this next one background copy #8?",
    "Bayes butterfly now I know what it is OK, beige.",
    "Butterfly and if you are still unsure of what the layer contained 'cause I don't know if it's the butterfly or believe.",
    "Or this background or the orange thing you can hold down your option key and then also isolate it.",
    "Just click in a little I so you know exactly what that layer contains because if you're still not sure.",
    "You can also I always isolate.",
    "The layer to see exactly what that layer contains that's now not so orange as I thought it was more.",
    "Pinkish reddish, but anyway, you get that no depends on the tent got it OK.",
    "So that is the zoom to layer capability, which under the view menu is officially called fit layers on screen.",
    "All right Next up?",
    "Um.",
    "This is one that I did not show in the keynote so OK.",
    "So now we're moving off the keynote stuff that was pretty much the stuff I showed in the keynote.",
    "Let's go grab a different image here, I'm going to go in and grab.",
    "Uhm I think this is the one I want yeah, OK so Penguins.",
    "Alright so I'm going to load a selection just for the sake of time select.",
    "Load selection an will do the lapping OK, so I didn't laughing when I got it selected now.",
    "An I'm just in the background.",
    "So if I hit my delete or backspace.",
    "Key you know that that does a content aware fill?",
    "You also know that a content aware fill is only as good as the surrounding pixels.",
    "So, sometimes if there's something to close.",
    "To the object you're trying to select.",
    "You end up.",
    "Pulling or trying to delete you end up pulling some of that object in so here it looks it.",
    "Do delete content aware fill.",
    "Hit OK.",
    "Wait, a few seconds and ask what starts to happen start, saying Oh I'll fill it in with the other Penguin.",
    "Well, that's not great, it's not we want it.",
    "There were all kinds of tricks.",
    "I had a video way back.",
    "When to show how to mass temporarily.",
    "The thing you didn't want to come over.",
    "And then do the content aware fill and then it would then you turn mask off and bring back the other element.",
    "Well, they've worked on this and content aware fill workspace workspace is not new came out last year.",
    "Also didn't make it into the keynote, but they've enhanced it this year as well.",
    "So let's go to instead of just doing the delete.",
    "Or backspace go to your edit menu.",
    "Come down to content aware fill which this is actually the work space for it.",
    "And what it does now is it will there's an option to auto.",
    "Basically auto Detect what shouldn't come over.",
    "In other words, auto detect what the subject is and it's showing me a preview of what it's already done.",
    "So it's already done it's already going to do the right thing I would do is click OK and it.",
    "Automatically did the content aware fill.",
    "Ann got rid of the other Penguin without pulling over the one next to it, so the content aware fill workspace.",
    "Was there last year?",
    "What's new this year?",
    "Is the auto instead of you having to paint and tell it.",
    "What not to bring over it will do a good job of auto detecting so that it can figure out what not to bring over.",
    "And then you go from there.",
    "OK.",
    "Next up, and hang on let me do one more thing real quick here.",
    "All right.",
    "That is cool alright.",
    "I agree Jeremy over on Behance.",
    "We grab one more thing over here, real quick.",
    "Ann.",
    "Da Da Da Da.",
    "Alright, OK, so Next up?",
    "The next one that was featured #6 enhanced content aware workspace feature #7 is a little thing, but it goes a long way for people that create smart.",
    "Objects.",
    "So for example, let Maine.",
    "Let's duplicate the layer actually know what let's undo it for a second.",
    "Oops I undo.",
    "Undo put it back.",
    "Let's go back up to that fill constant warfare workspace.",
    "And.",
    "I want to change the output to a new layer so In other words.",
    "Fill it in but put it on a new layer when you do that, so click OK does the same thing, but I get a new layer?",
    "Are great the reason?",
    "I wanted that new layer was so that I can then?",
    "Convert these 2 layers into a smart object, so something not new you been doing that for years.",
    "When I convert them into a smart object.",
    "The and if I double click on that, Smart Object I get to edit those 2 layers.",
    "So it opened up a new window.",
    "But those 2 layers in America close that window then I'm back to the original smart object.",
    "What's new is you now have the ability if you right click?",
    "Right click you have the ability to.",
    "Convert back to layers so you can take this smart, object that you've worked on bill did non destructive stuff, too.",
    "And then you could say at the end OK.",
    "I'm done with it being a smart object.",
    "I don't need it to be a smart object anymore and before your option was flattened it.",
    "Which obviously don't want to do so convert back to layers will convert it into layers again?",
    "So that I now have the ability.",
    "To work on them as layer, so that is featured #7 convert smart objects back to layers or 2 layers in the 1st place.",
    "All Right This is another one that's this one.",
    "Actually, I did not know about at first because I was kind of paying attention.",
    "Other things, but A new organization for our new improved preset panels.",
    "So how many of you are used the gradient hold your hand up.",
    "Yes, I've used gradients before gradients are awesome.",
    "But if you remember the gradient panel.",
    "Wasn't awesome it was this thing up here?",
    "That kind of this like scrolling through them You're trying to figure them out.",
    "Now, if you go to your window menu or things like gradients.",
    "There's a whole new gradient.",
    "Panel with all kinds of great presets in it, so if you like Purples.",
    "You like pinks you like Reds.",
    "You like Greys, you got a ton of gradient presets.",
    "All there ready to go ready for you to click on ready for you to do stuff with so for example.",
    "I can click through the gradient on what used to be the Old Penguin Alright, but you get the idea.",
    "So, just check out the presets.",
    "I'll do I didn't want for gradients.",
    "Here's another shocker.",
    "Here's one that really will be useful.",
    "In addition to gradients is shapes so if you go under window menu and come down to shapes.",
    "For the first time you've got a this a massive.",
    "This massive massive massive hang on not looking at the right way.",
    "Oh, there, we go you got this massive massive Library of shapes.",
    "Including more shapes so you've got leaf trees.",
    "You've got wild animals.",
    "You've got boats.",
    "You got Flowers and I think I need to reset mine.",
    "Restore default shapes let's do that.",
    "Yeah, 'cause I'm missing some categories.",
    "I believe hang on.",
    "Still, missing some categories alright.",
    "Oh, there, OK, so they came back now, so both Flowers wild animals leave trees.",
    "Fill out the others, the same ones as duplicated somehow.",
    "I need to reset this panel.",
    "Store import anyway, there should be another set of categories here that you'll probably have I gotta go figure out where mine are?",
    "But one of these shapes for so for example, if I wanted to bring in a different wild animal into the scene.",
    "Do I have anything that's snowbound.",
    "Probably not so let's let's do the far opposite let's bring bring a camel.",
    "We're going to vector camel shape that again is doing an ice free transform without me holding down the shift key perfectly.",
    "Without perfectly maintaining aspect ratio, so the vector shapes are there.",
    "As organized panels just like the gradients so you have the gradients shapes and patterns take advantage of those panels now.",
    "For organization an for working inside of Photoshop.",
    "Alright in that vector shape of course, those shapes come in as their own layer so you can do it.",
    "Whatever you want with Next up?",
    "That was number 8.",
    "Here's one that's kind of like.",
    "Just I've always done it the old way so I didn't expect to do it the new way.",
    "The new way of making an animated GIF so if you wanted to make an animated jump in the past, you go to your timeline.",
    "You'd create a video timeline from your layers.",
    "You could go in you could specify which layer is going to be where.",
    "Hang on let's see here.",
    "That data out 'cause it world up OK, there, we go toilet down.",
    "So I could say first come.",
    "Show me the background.",
    "Then show me the camel so let's bring the Camera out in time.",
    "So it's basically like working with the video.",
    "An background copy so for example, when I play this.",
    "The camel would just appear and it's a simple to layer thing it's not going to be.",
    "Very exciting.",
    "But if you want to make that an animated jif in the past for whatever you did on that timeline.",
    "You would go up and use the legacy safer web so you do a say about or actually you do an export.",
    "Safer web and safer web gave you the choice in the past of working.",
    "Our exporting out of Jeff and then whatever size you want it to be.",
    "And that still works, but what's better is going up to your file menu now.",
    "Choosing save as.",
    "Onto your computer an simply choosing jif.",
    "For the first time so if I were to say that out, as a.",
    "Um.",
    "As an animator drift, I get all my animation controls in it right here for me to do what I wanted to do with it.",
    "So.",
    "Oh let's see I want to make this.",
    "What version?",
    "And.",
    "So the ability to say about an animated Jeff directly.",
    "As well as this one check one more thing here.",
    "Don't don't bother saving your timeline out as an image if I just want to make sure I wasn't missing one more thing.",
