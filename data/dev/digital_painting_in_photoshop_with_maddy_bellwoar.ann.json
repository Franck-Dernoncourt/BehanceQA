    "It's not too small to make a small print anyway.",
    "But yeah, it's a good size.",
    "I think so.",
    "Um.",
    "Well, I'm glad you came over Reaper.",
    "Are you staying close to the ref or stylizing a bit more well.",
    "I think I always stylize some amount whether I want to or not just because I'm not painting.",
    "I'm never painting in like a hyper realistic manner.",
    "So there's always going to be a little bit of stylization to it.",
    "I generally lean a bit more towards like semi realism like kind of idealizing some of the features and the smoothing things out of it, I guess.",
    "But.",
    "Lately, I've been really favoring a more traditional painting style to the artworks through the paintings.",
    "If that makes sense.",
    "So I like to use textured brushes.",
    "I like to use things that resemble oil painting or gouache painting or watercolor.",
    "I like I like going for a traditional kind of look in my digital painting, but I'm very much doing like style explorations lately so.",
    "We'll see how it goes you might see some I might I'm going to be using my painterly brush set so if you guys want to download that it is, you can find it.",
    "Again, on the screen in the stream description or in the info panel.",
    "This is a free brush set and I've made some of the brushes and some were collected overtime.",
    "You can download it.",
    "Like I said it's free to download and there's a lot of.",
    "Textures like this, let me show real quick.",
    "Some of the brushes that I like have this kind of texture to them.",
    "So it's a little bit to imitate traditional type of painting look and also for anybody who has the Adobe If you have the subscription to photo shop.",
    "If you have Adobe.",
    "CC then you can download the Kyle Webster brushes as well.",
    "And those have a lot of good traditional textures, and a lot of awesome awesome effects.",
    "Traditional type affect so those are good to look at 2.",
    "But.",
    "Yeah, that's my plan that's my plan today will see what we end up with.",
    "But Yes, it will most certainly certainly be a little bit stylized so I'm going to start out with a Gray background just because I think it's a little bit more relaxing to look at and easier to start with so we'll start with a Gray background and I'm going to use my pencil brush and Oh actually yes and I also have the reference image over here, we bring it on screen.",
    "From my other monitor do why is it stuck.",
    "There we go just so you can see what I'm looking at you can download image if you'd like to see a closer.",
    "Pilot tiesha welcome how's your day going?",
    "I hope you guys are doing good.",
    "I'm going to paint the whole image for this one like it's I'm considering this a portrait.",
    "But it's also you know, kind of upper body.",
    "We're going to get the whole.",
    "We're going to get the whole thing in because I need to practice painting fabric folds, and wrinkles and things.",
    "I really like this sweater.",
    "It's so cozy looking and soft.",
    "So we'll try to like really make it look like that.",
    "So when I'm painting someone even with like a big fluffy sweater like this, I like to consider there.",
    "Their skeletal structure underneath the clothes so I'll kind of do like a little stick person.",
    "Because that helps me figure out where to place things if you kind of start painting the outside without thinking about what's going on underneath of it, you're going to end up with a big blob.",
    "It's nice to at least think a little bit about where things are going underneath of the underneath of the clothes.",
    "Um red it's just allergies.",
    "Thank you for being concerned, but I've been getting this question a lot.",
    "Lately, an sadly.",
    "This is just kind of what I'm going to sound like for the next maybe 2 months.",
    "Hopefully not that long, but I have seasonal allergies.",
    "I always get really bad allergies in the spring, usually even if I'm taking Medison I end up being stuffy and.",
    "Itchy eyes and weird voice and all kinds of stuff.",
    "So yeah, don't worry.",
    "I'm not sick.",
    "I'm just yeah.",
    "This is how I am at this time of year spring seems to be starting early here in the Netherlands.",
    "We didn't get a proper winter and yeah, there's all kinds of Flowers blooming and it looks nice.",
    "But then it makes me like this so.",
    "I'm sorry I have some tea, I will be drinking, so that helps a little bit.",
    "OK, so.",
    "Yeah got a little bit of a sketch like a stick person sketch and then I'll lower the Opacity on that and make a new layer and just start painting on Top or sorry sketching on Top next layer of.",
    "Next layer of.",
    "Detail.",
    "Oh, that's OK read no, I know I don't mind that's OK.",
    "I just feel bad 'cause.",
    "I've been getting that question a lot feel like I'm concerning you guys over over nothing but this is just like how I am right now.",
    "Reaper says my problem with that is every time I try it.",
    "They always end up looking through the but I think it's a practice thing I just need to get better at so I like using the stick person to just imagine that it's like this skeleton underneath and then I lower the Opacity and make a new layer and start properly sketching in in a more you know, keeping an eye moron like a 3D kind of.",
    "Viewpoint of it.",
    "So right now, I'm sketching in the wrinkles.",
    "And going around here.",
    "And so you can still see where the stick person is inside the sketch, but at least that gives me like an idea of where to put everything and then I don't end up really, really far off you can still be a little bit off.",
    "But it helps it helps give some kind of a starting point, I feel like.",
    "It can be overwhelming when you're starting to work on something.",
    "Do you still have the same food allergies actually it's been a little bit different since moving to the Netherlands Interesting?",
    "I guess the produce is a little bit different here.",
    "I have, I do have some still have some food allergies, but?",
    "It depends it's a little bit less like I can eat some things I couldn't eat before.",
    "At least certain brands of things I don't know if that makes sense.",
    "But like I'm allergic to some apples, but not all apples.",
    "Not all brands of apples.",
    "It might have something to do with chemicals being used rather than the actual Apple itself.",
    "But yeah, I do?",
    "Yeah.",
    "But back to the painting.",
    "So.",
    "Let's bring this arm down here.",
    "I will give a little wrinkle over on the side.",
    "And we can flip the canvas to get a look at it from over here.",
    "I want to get the feeling of her like kind of leaning over a little bit so I think it's working OK, so far.",
    "Let me change my.",
    "Eraser.",
    "I like the post of her hand.",
    "I think it's pretty.",
    "I like wearing sweaters that have a little bit longer sleeves because it's extra cozy and warm and.",
    "Yeah, I can keep your hands warm.",
    "I often have cold hands.",
    "So I like sweaters like this, I like cats coming up a little higher on her hand.",
    "OK Letisha well, thanks for hanging out.",
    "Enjoy the lurk.",
    "So let's get the head sheep.",
    "Hi Mister, Photoshop are how are you?",
    "I'm going to add a little bit more tilt to her head.",
    "I think I under estimated it.",
    "So yeah, will tilt it a little bit more.",
    "And that way we can have her hair kind of gravity is sort of affecting.",
    "Her hair and it's coming down around an over the shoulder like this.",
    "OK so I want to sketch in her facial features.",
    "And probably I probably will do this on another layer so I feel OK with how this looks so far, so I'm going to make a new layer that way.",
    "I have more flexibility to move things around.",
    "I think I made her face a little bit, too big but let's see how it goes.",
    "Reaper.",
    "Your being torn in different directions.",
    "OK, so.",
    "Let's make some lines here to try to help guide us on where facial features will go so this will be roughly like the eyes and eyebrows and then the nose and mouth is close to her, her hand is very next to her mouth so that will be down there and then her chin gets covered up by the hand.",
    "And her finger should be a little bit more up here in the cheek.",
    "So we'll move that and then her other finger.",
    "Down there.",
    "Sketch in the eyebrows.",
    "I like to make these guidelines and then lower the Opacity.",
    "And draw on Top of it, so that I can use them to help me figure out where to put things but they don't block my vision, so much.",
    "I'm a real.",
    "Who are you little question?",
    "Are you working with the graphic tablet if yes?",
    "Which one I'm doing good thanks and I am using a tablet.",
    "I have a welcome centriq 22 and that is a.",
    "Screen tablet, but I'm using a stylus to draw on the screen.",
    "There's a lot of options out there, though this you don't have to dive in and get something like a centigrade off the back 'cause they're.",
    "The generally a little bit more on the high end tablet wise, but I do really love my tablet, but there's a lot of options, you can look into.",
    "There's tablets that.",
    "You know there's screen tablets and then there's tablets that have it's kind of like your drawing on the mouse pad looking up at your monitor those are generally.",
    "Less expensive models, but can still be really good.",
    "Yeah, Oh, I forgot to mention that Mills.",
    "Yeah, it's really, really great news.",
    "Behance just made some some.",
    "Upgrades basically behind the scenes.",
    "So there will be less delay in the conversation between the chat and and you know what I mean, there's a little less stream delay, so it's going to be easier for us to chat.",
    "It's yeah, it's a big improvement high share a little question are you working with the graphics tablet.",
    "Oh yeah, yeah, so I'm using a Wakeham Centriq 22.",
    "I can post the name in the chat.",
    "In case it's easier to read that then my pronunciation, but yeah.",
    "I'm drawing on the screen.",
    "I think it's really helpful for painting it's not required to have a tablet for all types of.",
    "Digital art of course, but if you are painting or drawing and you want to have pressure sensitivity like for example, if you want.",
    "If you want your brush to get bigger and darker as you press down that's something that you can't really do with the mouse.",
    "You need a tablet some kind.",
    "Red cells would you say chatting me or chat and I OK this is one of those things to get off topic from art and go into a grammar.",
    "Discussion that's one of those things when I was in school.",
    "Apparently saying like chat and I or you know, my friend Susie and I would be technically correct grammar from what I was taught but nobody speaks like that at least not.",
    "Where I'm from in America?",
    "Most people will say and me, just colloquially more normal to say so.",
    "You can certainly say, and I if you want, but Nobody really speaks like that commonly so it's kind of strange but.",
    "Hey Drado welcome thanks for joining us.",
    "OK so let's sketch in her mouth.",
    "Depends on where in the sentence, it is.",
    "Yeah, that's also true that's also true.",
    "I have definitely don't know the rules enough to start teaching grammar two guys.",
    "I just know that normally it's one of those things that it's not a big problem.",
    "If you say, and me 'cause you'll just sound like most other people?",
    "Hey al, How are you?",
    "So I feel like it would be a benefit me to just take a little bit of extra time to sketch in the face and things and we can always fix it a little bit more in the painting phase.",
    "It's going OK, Reaper I'm I'm taking classes and that's going well, learning a language is a long journey just like.",
    "Yeah, learning an instrument or learning painting, it's something that you have to work on over a longer period of time I don't necessarily feel or see like a drastic improvement from one day to the next but I know I'm doing the right thing.",
    "Just studying and keeping going with it.",
    "So yeah, it's going OK.",
    "Thank you Sammy how are you?",
    "Thanks for the next comment.",
    "Hi Hun, Ji how are you?",
    "So the models like looking at us.",
    "So I can put her.",
    "Iris and the Right corner of her eye.",
    "She is a really pretty.",
    "I shape I think in her eyebrows like it.",
    "I think I've given her much bigger forehead, then she actually has Bo.",
    "Luckily, that's easy to fix one thing I love about digital art is you can just in this case.",
    "I'm using the lasso tool.",
    "You just make a selection of an area, I can transform it down.",
    "I can work it, I can there's just so many ways.",
    "You can take your pick.",
    "But there's a lot of different ways to easily modify that so I use the transform tool is quite a bit in my sketch phase to fix little things here and there.",
    "Hi Phil's how are you?",
    "OK, so let's merge these 2 layers together had them separate for awhile.",
    "But I think we're good to merge and see what we can do from here.",
    "So she has a little bit of a swirl going on in that her hair and the hair part.",
    "And then got cheekbone and her finger kind of.",
    "Pushing into her cheek a little bit so we get a little bit of an indentation there.",
    "And then this finger.",
    "And then this one.",
    "And then finally little one.",
    "We do see her knuckles coming out.",
    "And then the sweater.",
    "Alright so let me just take a look at the fabric folds because I do want them to be accurate.",
    "Since this is one of the main reasons that I'm studying this image is because I want to get some practice painting folds fabric folds.",
    "It's something that I generally kind of avoid be honest.",
    "And my way of avoiding it is just I'll generally really tone down any folds that exist in fabric when I'm painting someone I find that they can make an image look really messy and they make it hard for you to see the anatomy of the person.",
    "I tend to like to paint more fitted clothing.",
    "But even when there are wrinkles and things I generally kind of tone him down.",
    "A little bit so there's still wrinkles.",
    "But maybe not quite as much as you see here so.",
    "That said, We're trying to get a little bit of practice on this subject.",
    "So I'm going to try to properly illustrate them, take my time to do a better job.",
    "Right now, I'm just putting some lines in to show myself where the wrinkles are going to be and then when we start painting.",
    "I'll be able to do the shading and.",
    "Paint with this sketch to help me.",
    "I heard in a video once that the less folds, the better it reads.",
    "Yeah, I think I think it's true like I think that you can give the idea of the folds without necessarily having an absolute ton of them.",
    "If you I feel like if you especially if you focus the folds in like you know for example, the underarm area, or this you know your elbow anywhere, where you're moving and creating this crease, putting a couple fold.",
    "There is great, but I really do think it makes for a cleaner image to not over do it.",
    "With the clothing folds.",
    "So I'm hoping that these studies will make me get you know.",
    "Give me a little bit more practice in painting them properly when I do include them.",
    "But I don't think that I will in the future be.",
    "Still, trying.",
    "I don't think I will have a big change with how I how many folds.",
    "I generally paint in a scene that makes sense like hopefully, I'll be able to do a better job with them because of this practice, but I still think I kind of prefer not to over do it.",
    "Because exactly what Red said it becomes hard to see the form of the person underneath all the wrinkles.",
    "There's also a little bit of extra challenge in that bees.",
    "The folds and her whole sweater has stripes alittle bit.",
    "There's some kind of striping pattern in the texture of the shirt.",
    "It's not printed strikes.",
    "But like a textured stripe so we'll see if that's going to make it into the painting.",
    "I think I'd like to indicate that kind of texture.",
    "It looks nice and soft.",
    "But also seems like a lot of extra work.",
    "So we'll see if we can give a hint of that type of fabric texture without painting every single line.",
    "Hopefully we can, we can do that.",
    "Just cleaning up my sketch of her finger a little bit.",
    "I made it worse.",
    "Alright we'll leave that for now.",
    "And clean out more in the painting phase.",
    "I'm just cleaning up erasing out some of my lines.",
    "They aren't Needed.",
    "Read says putting less folds to illustrate how the club is wrapping or moving.",
    "I think you can start with adding a bunch and try to erase some to the point.",
    "Its most readable for you.",
    "That's a good way of doing it.",
    "See, which ones you can get away without having.",
    "Oh, I'm sorry read I don't know the exact.",
    "The number restriction character limit on the chat.",
    "Actually, not sure what it is.",
    "I'm going to move her hands up a tiny bit more.",
    "It's a little bit higher than I had it.",
    "I think a little bit closer to her face.",
    "Yeah.",
    "200.",
    "OK.",
    "Hello fire how are you?",
    "I'm using work to just modify my sketch of her face.",
    "The tiny bit like think I think we're ready to start painting.",
    "And I don't think that everything is perfect, with this sketch.",
    "But I don't consider my sketches to be like a finished line art or something it really is more of a sketch.",
    "What I'll do is put it on multiply so it's easier to see through lower the opacity to like 1820% something you know something around there and then lock.",
    "The layer press this button right here and that way.",
    "If you try to paint on it, it won't allow you so I do this because I'm going to be painting under this layer and just using it as a guide of like where to paint an I don't want to accidentally pay on the sketch layer.",
    "Well, I can pass that on that feedback on red so thanks for letting me know.",
    "OK.",
    "So we'll save here and we're going on, too.",
    "And you A new chapter of this painting so.",
    "New layer and I have to decide what order I want to paint things in when I'm painting landscapes.",
    "I really like to go back to front.",
    "It's just a logical way to do it to paint the Sky first or whatever is furthest away.",
    "In this scene, we could do something similar and paint the background first or at least get a base.",
    "Kind of color back in there, the only problem I run into when I have a really dark background, which this is a pretty dark.",
    "One is once you start painting in a color back there.",
    "I'll just do it quick example.",
    "Once I start painting in this background.",
    "Color then suddenly, we can't see the sketch anymore.",
    "And it gets really hard to work.",
    "So I think what I'll do is paint in her at least as like a very base base color like will just use a block block.",
    "Something in for her.",
    "That way we can paint.",
    "The background and we can still see our sketch and it will be a little easier, that way so.",
    "OK, so I think I will use a soft brush.",
    "There's multiple ways to do this.",
    "Sometimes if I want to go quickly and fill in a big selection.",
    "I'll just take the lasso tool like this select it and just pop pop a paint bucket in like that.",
    "That's a really quick way the only downside to this is.",
    "You end up with some really sometimes really hard edges to your selection.",
    "You can use the feathering on the lasso to help prevent that.",
    "But I'm just going to use a soft paint brush to fill in to paint in inside my sketch and the reason for this is I'm hoping to get a nice.",
    "Painterly sortof affect to the this artwork.",
    "I'd like it to look more hand painted so, so actually painting it in with the brush instead of making a selection it gives a little bit less of A.",
    "Technical look to it, it makes it look more handgun so.",
    "OK, so now we have a base color an now because of that we can paint behind it, and do things with the background and.",
    "It's not a problem we don't sketch doesn't completely disappear, so that's why I'm going in this order.",
    "Although I'd really rather do the background first, but now we can do it.",
    "So.",
    "In the background, we have, like a really dark.",
    "Really dark areas.",
    "In between these leaves and then the leaves kind of like coming out into the light a little bit.",
    "So you get a lot of these deep shadows.",
    "So I think a good way to paint this, or what might be a little bit of an easier way is to go sort of dark to light so pick a pretty dark color put that in as the base and then on Top of it start painting leaves coming out of the shadows rather than adding the shadows too.",
    "To a lighter painting, I think it will be easier to go dark to light.",
    "So that's something to think about.",
    "Hail avenged thanks for coming over.",
    "How are you?",
    "Hi Alexander, I'm doing well thanks.",
    "I am excited about this painting actually it's I don't know it has kind of like even though she's wearing modern clothing.",
    "She's wearing like this fluffy sweater.",
    "I kind of getting like forest.",
    "Elf vibes from this reference a little bit with the leaves all over her like it's just very kind of autumn.",
    "It's a good feeling so I like this reference.",
    "So I'm going to start with this dark background, something very dark Brown green something in the middle there.",
    "And yeah, you can just use a paint bucket or fill it in however you want.",
    "But there's our background.",
    "I'm going to make a new layer on Top of that.",
    "And we can start painting some colors coming out from the background, so for example, you can really take any brush.",
    "It depends on what style you want to go for and just start painting.",
    "Little little shapes like this, it will start looking like little leaf shapes coming out of the shadows so for me.",
    "I think it would be nice to choose brushes that are a little bit.",
    "Um textured or have a little bit of a look like it's a real paint brush or something like that.",
    "I also recently created a whole pack of brushes that has like foliage shapes and all kinds of stuff like that.",
    "Some of those might be handy for a quick for a really quick impression of leaves back there.",
    "That would be nice and fast, another thing.",
    "Is we can choose to put a blur effect on this background so that's something we can do if you look at the image over here on the right is a little bit of a Leica distance.",
    "Blair can you see that, like the Camera lens blur and then over here closer to her.",
    "It's nice and in focus, so we can also do that in our painting.",
    "Sometimes it's nice to to paint in real quick and then you know you can.",
    "Just go to filter blur and use like a gausian blur or lens blur or something like that.",
    "There's actually a lot of box blur.",
    "There's a lot of options that will work.",
    "And you can put this blur filter on so look how quick and easy that is.",
    "I honestly I think that fastest and easiest way for me to paint this would be to.",
    "Yeah, do 1 layer really quick just scribbling in basically and then go ahead and blur it and then paint on Top.",
    "So that's going to be my plan.",
    "How do you change pen tryst pencil so quick Hey Quinn so I just if you click up here?",
    "To your when you have your brush tool selected you can click up here and it brings the drop down menu for your brushes and you can scroll through them and select them you can even set up keyboard shortcuts to automatically switch you to the next brush or to a previous brush or something like that.",
    "But I honestly.",
    "I usually just scroll through them and pick them out this way.",
    "Thanks, Mohammed.",
    "Thank you that would be awesome avenged.",
    "I'd love if you would join us on this one.",
    "Yeah, so let me will just go through and pop in some more leaves like this and then will apply a blur and then will paint another layer on Top so I think that will be.",
    "Pretty fast way to do this.",
    "And if you want you can use a couple different I'm using uh.",
    "Like a plant brush.",
    "Sometimes it's nice to use a couple different types of shapes to make it look more natural but realistically with the amount of blur.",
    "I'm going to put on this, it probably doesn't matter if we really use a lot of different shapes or not.",
    "You could probably just also go in with like any shape brush and it would be fine.",
    "Another thing you can do is go to edit transform perspective.",
    "And maybe keep in mind that it looks like the.",
    "The Flowers or plants to the right are getting smaller and the ones getting closer to us on the left.",
    "There are bigger just because of the angle how she is against the wall that's something to think about but.",
    "I think.",
    "I will just pay attention to that when I get into the next painting fees.",
    "OK let's see what this looks like.",
    "Filter blur Gaussian blur Gaussian blur ends up being my favorite most of the time it's just like.",
    "A real basic blur.",
    "Alright I think that's good.",
    "So now I've got blurred background and this is just a base for us to paint on Top of this is just making our job a little bit easier.",
    "'cause Can you imagine look at this?",
    "How much detail there is coming into this scene having to paint all that it seems a bit overwhelming so having this as a starting point is for me a little bit.",
    "More welcoming that we could make a new layer and start painting a little bit nice nicer on Top of it.",
    "So.",
    "For example, let's find.",
    "A brush we want to use I like.",
    "This one poops let me show you hear this one, it looks like a paintbrush.",
    "If you like this brush or any of the brushes.",
    "I'm using there are links below in the stream description.",
    "And you can go a little bit both ways.",
    "You can choose the dark color from The Shadow and start painting.",
    "Some of that in there's going to be a little bit of a disconnect at first just a warning when you're painting on Top of this blurred background and you start using a hard edge brush or something like that.",
    "It's going to be a bit jarring at first to see those hard edges.",
    "It's going to look like it doesn't belong you have to do some more painting to kind of blend the.",
    "The out of focus with the more focused if you want a slightly more subtle transition between the two you could use a brush like this one, which has is a little bit softer, it does have hard edge, but it's a little bit softer, so that might.",
    "That might feel better, so we can start painting with this one.",
    "So I just want to get the background a little bit more far along it's not I don't want to sit here and paint the whole background before starting the character but or the?",
    "The woman in the portrait, but I do want to get a little bit more done just because I personally find that.",
    "Having the backgrounds at least blocked in well enough, it helps give the idea of the mood and the environment that the person is in because a lot of times lighting and things in the background will affect your character in this scene.",
    "Maybe it's not in a really dramatic way, but often you'll see that.",
    "Light will bounce off of something let's say if you character standing next to a blue ball or something light will hit that wall and then hit the person and you'll see like a little bit of blue on their skin.",
    "For example, or it'll just tint them a little bit.",
    "So the environment around whoever your painting if you're doing a portrait for example, is pretty important to consider early on.",
    "Even though you it might be way more excited about painting the person and the environment if you do consider it.",
    "It will it will pay off will pay off?",
    "So just a few more leaves.",
    "Then we'll start painting Our Lady and then we'll take a break from the background for a bit and come back to this later.",
    "I try to work around the scene kind of.",
    "Alright evenly so I don't want to take any one area and make it completely finished.",
    "Before the other areas got a chance to have anything done to them.",
    "I like to move around to work around the image and slowly.",
    "Get everything towards a finished place so that's why we should probably stop here on the background before I get too carried away.",
    "Thank you for choosing to work on this ref the sweater seems intimidating Oh you're welcome.",
    "Thank you.",
    "I'm glad you like this one.",
    "I hope it's gonna go well.",
    "I think I think it will.",
    "This is also a learning experience for me, I'm happy to teach what I do know and share my process, but",
    "As we do these paintings of different different subjects.",
    "I'm also learning a lot as we go so there might be a little trial and error along the way here.",
    "But OK let's get back to Our Lady now.",
    "So just looking at her looking at my reference seeing if there's anything since I've been looking at the background for awhile not looking at her sometimes looking back, you will start just notice something different that you didn't notice before so I think I'm just going to add a little bit more width to the sweater on her on the left side.",
    "OK and then.",
    "Let's start painting.",
    "Your color panel looks so cool well.",
    "Thank you Bella.",
    "It is an extension.",
    "It's Coulouris.",
    "I'm going to type in the chat for you.",
    "If you want to look it up because it's a little bit of A.",
    "Weird spelling so.",
    "Yeah, that's That's it if you wanted to look it up.",
    "I do really like it, although if you have the recent if you have 2019 or 2020 photo shop.",
    "You can go to window color and you can get a color wheel with the triangle now in the past.",
    "It was the Hue cube like this, which is still available but you can also go here and switch to color wheel.",
    "So this is very similar to Coulouris Coolers, a couple extra functions that I don't use often but I have it.",
    "So it will use it.",
    "But if you really only care about the triangle you can get it through photo shop.",
    "OK, so.",
    "I'm going to let's get into painting her so I'm going to lock the layer.",
    "This is a super convenient thing because we have this on its own layer.",
    "You can press this little checkerboard icon appear and then when I paint on that layer anything that I do anything that I paint is only going to be allowed to affect that shape that I already created so I don't even have to worry.",
    "I can just paint.",
    "However, I want then it's going to be in the lines so that's really nice.",
    "Because then we can do things like for example, pick a shadow color and kind of just come along the edge and swipe in like this and.",
    "It's just only only within that shape.",
    "So.",
    "See what I was talking about earlier with the colors surrounding the character may be affecting them.",
    "I'm noticing now that there's a little bit of a green hint to the color of the shadow on her sweater over here and I think that's a little bit of a reflection of the wall, the plant will next door so.",
    "I tend to work.",
    "Midtones 1st and then shadows and highlights.",
    "So what that means is usually in the early in the early phases of my painting things don't have extremely high contrast usually.",
    "It's going to be a little bit dark and then it gets brighter towards when it's getting more finished.",
    "So.",
    "Hi Mads, how are you?",
    "And we can choose a warmer color for to start differentiating the skin.",
    "From the rest of her and the same for her hair.",
    "Choose a Brown.",
    "So now we're having a little bit of trouble seeing her head separate from the background.",
    "So that's something we can look at later and maybe put some lighter leaves behind her head.",
    "So it makes it easier to see or highlights in her hair.",
    "We can decide how to do it.",
    "But basically one we should probably decide about one thing being slightly later than the other.",
    "So we'll be able to see her.",
    "Her head more easily.",
    "So her hair gets a little bit later towards the edges.",
    "A little bit more like Golden warm Brown color.",
    "Now there's a lot of different workflows in different ways to go about this.",
    "Right now, I'm basically trying to get somewhat of the local color painted in on each area like her hair.",
    "Is now a dark Brown her sweater?",
    "Is a beige trying to get the right color here?",
    "I want to go a little later?",
    "And I don't want to get sucked into any little little details on the sweater.",
    "Yet like any little wrinkles.",
    "I want to look at the big picture so big picture wise her arm is getting late.",
    "Splash here and here coming down the middle of course, the light is hitting certain ring.",
    "You know certain wrinkles and folds and you're seeing some in shadow, but we're not going to go super into that yet.",
    "We just want to establish where the big areas of light are so here.",
    "Play is hitting and here.",
    "And this arm is a pretty big.",
    "Area of way over here.",
    "So even my lights are not the brightest they're going to go right now.",
    "I want to save that for like.",
    "Finishing touches kind of thing at the end, we're going to put in the brightest highlights or maybe not.",
    "The very end, but it's something we're working our way up to.",
    "There's a hand, I know there's a hand.",
    "An extra little challenge.",
    "OK, so I'm going to make a new layer.",
    "We were painting.",
    "All of that basically right on the layer and I'm going to make a new layer now and we're going to make a clipping mask so this is the layer.",
    "I'm going to right click, and go to create clipping mask or you can use a shortcut for that.",
    "You can hold alt and hover your stylus.",
    "In between the new layer and the one you want to clip on to an just press down when you see the arrow icon.",
    "Then you have a clipped layer so this is the same thing almost as the lock transparency in the sense that I'm painting, I can only paint in the lines, but I'm painting on a separate layer from my painting, I can move this around they can get rid of it.",
    "So it's a little bit of less of a destructive painting method and the nice thing about this is I can paint on this layer and see if I like it if I can see if I like the results before like committing to what I've done so I'm going to switch to the Airbrush.",
    "And do a little bit of shading with the airbrush I'm going to put my layer blending mode on multiply because this is really handy for doing shadows multiply blending mode is nice because it it will darken areas.",
    "But it also it seems like you've got it tested out and get a feel for it, but",
    "It's nice because it preserves more of your detail it darkens everything in it doesn't just like with with a normal mode.",
    "If I use this color.",
    "It kind of wipes out all detail underneath whereas multiply will darken it.",
    "But you'll still be able to see what was already painted so it's a nice way to.",
    "Add shadows and modify your painting without having to redo everything.",
    "Underneath.",
    "Hawaii Gore how are you?",
    "I want to pick like a warm dark Brown and I'm going to use that to paint in some shadows and I'm going to take the lasso tool and use it as sort of a stencil so I'm going to use my lasso tool to block off areas that I want to either paint within or I want to avoid painting on so it kind of depends so for example, like this wrinkle over here.",
    "I'm going to make a selection of the area that I want to have a shadow and then.",
    "Paint in that area.",
    "And deselect and now you see that there's a shadow if you want to smudge.",
    "You can use the smudge brush if you want to soften that edge a little bit.",
    "Height one how are you?",
    "In this little there's a little.",
    "The wrinkle over here, so I'm going to do the same thing basically and create a little.",
    "Block off a little area where I want the darkest shadow to be.",
    "And then I just painted in that space.",
    "And the nice thing about this is you can create gradients.",
    "And like soft shading.",
    "And block off areas that you don't want to paint it and so I think it's very nifty.",
    "I use it a lot.",
    "I use this technique a lot.",
    "I think it went a little too, too, dark without wrinkles.",
    "So we can just use the airbrush to race out.",
    "Also, since we're talking we're doing studies on wrinkles and painting fabric in clothes and things I can say that.",
    "A lot of people underestimate how much you can do with just a little bit of Airbrush.",
    "Now I really like having textured look to my painting, but I still find that it sometimes it's easy to easier to use the airbrush to create a form.",
    "It's almost almost as an effect of like a 3D model sculpt if you do a nice job with the airbrush shading and then you can paint whatever kinds of textures, you'd like on Top.",
    "So I'm using the The Airbrush to get me started with putting the.",
    "Wrinkles where I want.",
    "Yeah, the delay is improved now, so it should be less than before.",
    "Um.",
    "Yeah, it specifically for.",
    "For me for streamers in Europe, it's a big improvement.",
    "His surplus how are you?",
    "Under her arm, we're going to add.",
    "A shadow.",
    "And that might be an area where we want to leave kind of hard edge or just a blurry a tiny tiny bit.",
    "It's reduced there still is a little bit of a delayed rado, but it's more within like.",
    "I think it's pretty normal amount at this point.",
    "There's almost always going to be at least a little bit of a delay with streaming.",
    "But it's a more minimal it seems.",
    "So tired today have a lot of things to do how are you today I'm doing good?",
    "I'm doing better than yesterday yesterday?",
    "I was feeling how you were feeling now, I was super tired.",
    "I didn't get a very good night of sleep, but last night was much better, so I feel alive feel alive today.",
    "So thank you doing, good, I hope I hope your day goes well, Despite that surplus.",
    "OK so we've got some wrinkles.",
    "And there are a bit dark, but we're going to go back in and do.",
    "More detail I can tone it down a little bit.",
    "Let's work on the face a little bit and we can use the same kind of techniques here.",
    "For example, behind the nose on this side of the face.",
    "We want we can put a shadow you can actually do the same thing and make a selection to block off the side of the nose.",
    "Like that.",
    "I like to use this much brush a lot, too kind of tone down my.",
    "My selections so they don't really want a hard edge to be seen there.",
    "I want a little bit more of a subtle.",
    "Little bit more so look.",
    "You can hear the birds in the background.",
    "I know it's like such a classic spring day feeling going on right here.",
    "It's nice weather outside and.",
    "Birds chirping.",
    "OK, So what I was talking about earlier.",
    "I usually work dark to light this painting is looking pretty muddy and pretty dark right now, but hang with me OK.",
    "We're going to get some life into it.",
    "I'll show you how I'm going to do that.",
    "Last thing I want to do shadow wise before we move on is just a painting her eyebrows.",
    "And then will start breaking things up here.",
    "Oh also beeping.",
    "OK so knew layer and I'll either do this next phase on normal layer mode or sometimes something like overlay.",
    "Overlay is really nice layer blending mode for sort of brightening things and giving a little extra saturation to them.",
    "I really like it for adding like subsurface, scattering to this skin that little effect of like for example, if you have a light shining from behind someone an going through their ear or something like that, and it gets like a pink color that's the subsurface scattering so.",
    "This can be really nice for that kind of effect.",
    "Right right we're in We're we're a bit in the ugly phase right now.",
    "It's like when the painting just doesn't look like what you intended to look like.",
    "But you gotta go through the phases, yeah, so we're going to brighten up her face a little bit.",
    "And this will also saturate a little bit give a little bit more color to her skin.",
    "I do use the layer blending modes of my painting.",
    "Some people prefer to paint all on normal mode.",
    "I've been doing that, more and more lately just because I think I've as I get more practice.",
    "I've been more likely to just pick colors.",
    "I like from the beginning with my painting it's not always the case.",
    "But.",
    "That being said, I do use layer blending modes a lot to like modify things that I've done and improve them so.",
    "Just give a little bit more.",
    "More life to this.",
    "And then now I'll make a new layer an paints with I'll go back to painting with normal.",
    "On a normal layer so I'm picking my own my own colors and everything like that.",
    "Versus like letting overlay.",
    "Give me surprise what's going to happen.",
    "So I'm going to choose pink for the lips?",
    "Actually, one thing that you can do is color pic from the colour.",
    "That's already there, and then modify that Hue shifted to something closer to what you want.",
    "Sometimes that'll help get a result, that's not so jarring.",
    "Then going to the color wheel picking a random color.",
    "All thank you pixel you're so sweet.",
    "Thank you.",
    "I really like her makeup too.",
    "I don't usually I usually like painting portraits where if I'm painting a female portrait.",
    "For example, like this one.",
    "I usually like going really natural and not putting a lot of makeup on it.",
    "On the face, but I think her makeup looks really nice and is kind of this natural earthy tones.",
    "So.",
    "People go with it.",
    "So a lot of times at this Phase I will try to get rid of my sketch.",
    "This is with, and without the sketch so you can see that I still kind of need it for some information.",
    "So here's my compromise.",
    "I'm going to duplicate the sketch.",
    "So I can save a layer just in case I need to reference.",
    "It later but what I'll do is.",
    "On the duplicate I'm going to erase out.",
    "Anything that I don't think I need any more.",
    "I think most of her outfit.",
    "The wrinkles are there enough that I don't really need the sketch anymore?",
    "The area that I really need it, I think is still her face.",
    "Maybe the eyes for example, 'cause I didn't really paint them in at all yet.",
    "So I'm just erasing everything that's not needed and then.",
    "Whatever is left we can just merge that down.",
    "So now that's part of this layer with her now.",
    "Everything's on one layer and this is kind of how I go from painting or from drawing to painting phase.",
    "Now I'm no longer going to have that sketch on I will have it in case I need it, but most likely.",
    "I'm going to leave it off for the rest of the painting and we're just going to go from here so.",
    "Now I can go and paint on Top of the original sketch of the eyes and change them and hopefully improve them and not have to go back and forth between layers to do that I can.",
    "Just go from here, so right now.",
    "I'm working on a new layer above and on normal mode and I'm just going to paint.",
    "I should probably stay zoomed out it's so tempting to zoom in because I'm painting her face and I want to be able to see the details but at the same time.",
    "This is uh.",
    "This image isn't it just about the portrait.",
    "There's also a background that her whole sweater and everything so.",
    "I'm gonna stay zoomed out.",
    "Until we at least get it further along and then I can look at zoom in.",
    "And fix little details and things but I don't think we're like, at that step.",
    "Yet we didn't we didn't earn our zoom in you guys, we have to paint more before we can zoom in.",
    "That's one of the more helpful things that I started doing with my painting is just staying zoomed out until it's.",
    "Until you really need to get it in Polish, it up.",
    "And that keeps it just likely that you'll have better proportions.",
    "Going on with your painting.",
    "Right we do see a little light on her chin down here.",
    "And let's start painting in the eyes.",
    "I might switch brushes, though I'm painting with A brush that's really difficult to do details because it's so soft.",
    "So I'm going to choose a harder edge brush.",
    "And here we go.",
    "Reading a time study on the salon are taking your time.",
    "I'm more taking my time on this one hunji.",
    "I'm not planning on working on like multiple paintings.",
    "During this stream.",
    "I'm going to try to spend more time on this one and take it to a more finished place.",
    "I noticed that yesterday yesterday.",
    "I was doing some studies these fabric studies and I found them really challenging.",
    "And I felt like I needed more time so I'm going to take it a little slower today.",
    "Plus, I'd like to actually get a little portrait practice in with this, too, so it's like a double.",
    "Study of portrait and.",
    "The outfit.",
    "Give a little bit more, she's wearing like orange.",
    "A bird orange kind of eye shadow, it, fits the autumn vibes around here.",
    "I did choose this picture yes.",
    "If anybody is you know likes the reference image.",
    "You can find it below the stream in the description panel or above the chat and info tab.",
    "If you'd like to do a painting with with us you can join in.",
    "Yeah, I chose this one.",
    "Hi pro designer.",
    "I'm doing good thanks how are you?",
    "Alright I'm pretty dumb.",
    "Sort of anxious to get in there and paint the face.",
    "But I'm going to wait on that and spend a little bit more time looking at the picture as a whole and then will zoom in so first thing I want to do is look at the overall shape of her head because looking at it now.",
    "I think I added like a whole bunch of poofy hair to the side for some reason I don't know I like painting fluffy hair big, big flowing hair.",
    "But.",
    "We're going to stay closer to the reference doesn't have quite as much hair over there.",
    "So something more like that.",
    "And we can go a little bit warmer get some of the lighter colors on the ends of the hair.",
    "And we can also just brighten up overall we can go to image adjust.",
    "Curves levels these are always to mess with your brightness and contrast levels and just the overall lights lights and darks in the image and you can improve things with that, so we can just brighten things up.",
    "You can also go to color balance.",
    "We can look at the shadows that we want things to be more you know tended towards any specific color.",
    "Maybe we can give a different feel to it or something more accurate.",
    "I think it's helpful to do this along the way as you go.",
    "I don't know if I like what I did there, but I was kinda just showing the sliders.",
    "I think basically the highlights need to be a little bit more cool.",
    "That's one thing that I'm feeling in this.",
    "Another thing you can do is you can adjust that through the curves also so we could go to red and maybe like tone down the Red Curves, a little bit.",
    "Then the blue.",
    "Little bit more.",
    "Anyway, we've got a lot more painting to do so.",
    "Any specific reason about Wednesday streaming.",
    "Uhm I just like to stream on a regular schedule.",
    "I like to pick a day and.",
    "Be able to stick to it, rather than kind of streaming randomly.",
    "I know, people have all different kinds of.",
    "Schedules and thoughts on that there's a lot of people that stream just like when they have the time.",
    "But it helps me to have a schedule so.",
    "I like to be able to be here and people if they want can plan to be here if they enjoy the stream.",
    "Could you show me what would happen if you do auto color OK?",
    "Let's try image adjust?",
    "Oh, auto, yeah, auto color there, it is wow.",
    "Look how cool that is.",
    "It's very, very cool like blue cool.",
    "Alright so I want to give a little bit of a highlight to the outside of her head.",
    "Just a little bit of a shine, maybe on the hair.",
    "I just feel like I'm losing her with the plants behind there, I guess the other option is we could lighten the plants.",
    "But.",
    "It's just hard to see.",
    "See her because she has a dark hair and there's kind of a dark background, so that's a little bit better.",
    "OK.",
    "That right there was a crazy result, sometimes it looks really good when you use the auto tone or auto color, but other times, not as much?",
    "OK, so now we're at the the phase in the painting where it doesn't look so hot, however.",
    "Everything is in place.",
    "So we can go ahead and just render and have fun with painting it and making it look better.",
    "The background is there.",
    "The characters there.",
    "She's got a lot of work to be done.",
    "But she's mainly blocked in the proportions are there and?",
    "I find this a good place to be in with the painting as far as like.",
    "I feel like I've worked through some of the more difficult parts of the set up and now we can tweak some little things and just carry on.",
    "So I'm going to.",
    "I'm looking at the reference and I think I missed out on a little bit of like a tilt to her hand.",
    "If you guys see that.",
    "So.",
    "I'm going to.",
    "Do that little group will tilt.",
    "And.",
    "Make a couple adjustments to where things are wall.",
    "Everything is still very malleable because we haven't painted a lot of details anywhere.",
    "So I don't feel too.",
    "That's too precious to adjust and move things around so.",
    "For it.",
    "Want to move something over.",
    "I'm going to do that.",
    "And then we can, we can carry on.",
    "I wonder why it was so great this is really intense.",
    "One thing that I I mistake I used to make was I would get into details, too soon, mostly just because I you know like anyone I didn't like the ugly stage in the painting.",
    "You want things to look good, so I had a hard time working around the painting 'cause I would paint.",
    "One area until it was more finished just because I wanted to see it be nice.",
    "You know, and what I would end up with is if I wanted to make changes it would be kind of difficult 'cause I had already rendered that area.",
    "Lots so making a change like that would have been maybe more troublesome.",
    "But we're in the place right now where nothing is too detailed so we can move things around.",
    "And then when we were like OK, we're good to go then will start.",
    "Start painting some nice shading.",
    "So I've been using very soft brushes up to now.",
    "I think I'm going to soon switch to some brushes that have a little bit more texture to them and like I was talking about the beginning of the stream.",
    "I really like the look of sort of traditional painting.",
    "In digital work as well so you know imitation of.",
    "Oil painting textures, or watercolor gouache?",
    "Why not so I'm probably going to go for more of a oil kind of look here.",
    "Merge that down.",
    "So let's begin I'm going to take a brush called the soft paint round brush and that's because it's something similar to what you would use the hard round Brush War.",
    "But it's just got a little bit more of an interesting shape and a little bit more texture than the hard round brush, but it basically serves the same result.",
    "Serves the same purpose.",
    "And let's start painting on her face.",
    "I will zoom in a little bit.",
    "I'm going to zoom in on the reference.",
    "I have the reference on my other monitor.",
    "Let's see maybe I can flip this too.",
    "I don't usually.",
    "Bother but Let's see this images.",
    "Arrange.",
    "I don't remember how to do it quickly but it's one extra step.",
    "So I hope you guys don't mind if I don't flip that it's just easier for me, I flip my reference on the other monitor my full size reference.",
    "I do flip that whenever you see me painting with the canvas flipped I'm not just like.",
    "That I'm not just like so brilliant that I can flip it in my head.",
    "I am looking at the flipped version.",
    "On my other monitor so.",
    "Well, after getting after zooming in this is a bit more rough than I thought I think I actually will work with the airbrush a tiny bit more guys before going to the texture brush.",
    "This is just going to be easier.",
    "And then will start going in with texture so.",
    "The airbrushes nice I can add color like this.",
    "She has a little bit more warm through her skin than what I have here so we'll start with that.",
    "On the eyes and the nose.",
    "Um.",
    "Mill says in pure ref flip by holding shift alt and dragging the left mouse button in the direction you want to flip.",
    "I wonder how many times it will take me to remember that shift alt OK cool.",
    "Thank you Mills.",
    "Thank you.",
    "It's one of those things I gotta commit to my memory because.",
    "Probably remember it forget that by the next time Is It.",
    "Need to write myself a sticky note.",
    "Oh, that was orange, so anyway, yeah, using the The Airbrush to sculpt in give her little shadow under her eyelids.",
    "To establish the shape.",
    "Up above and below the eyelids.",
    "I find the Airbrush and soft brushes really so much more friendly to use for this people have different preferences, you know.",
    "I'm I'm kind of at that point where I'm struggling a little bit with deciding making workflow changes because.",
    "I do as I was saying, I do like to have a little bit more of that.",
    "Painterly, look, but I find that my workflow.",
    "I really enjoy working with the airbrush.",
    "I like it.",
    "It makes me feel almost like I'm creating a 3D model.",
    "I just find it really satisfying to get these soft.",
    "Shadows and things.",
    "So I think my compromise to that is going to be to start.",
    "Painting, the using the airbrush method in the early stages, the kind of sculpt in a base for myself and then start using some textured brushes at some point during the?",
    "Sort of polishing fees and hopefully get texture that way.",
    "We'll see we'll see.",
    "I'm still I like to experiment with different workflows and use.",
    "These studies in order to do it, so I can try new things.",
    "I think he Mills.",
    "Well, that's nice.",
    "Welcome everybody if anybody is watching or listening and you have any questions.",
    "Feel free to ask me.",
    "I like to explain as I go.",
    "But if there's anything.",
    "I'm doing and you're wondering about it, you can just let me know.",
    "And also, if you'd like to see or use the reference image.",
    "You can find a link to it below the stream or in the info tab.",
    "Anyone is welcome to paint along I like to do group studies during my streams.",
    "So I am studying this image, doing a little painting of it and if you'd like to also do a study of her.",
    "You can take the reference and you're welcome to share whatever you do you can post it in the chat?",
    "If you like.",
    "OK so this is a before and after of a few minutes of painting with the airbrush so it's still.",
    "In the early stages, but you can see that something's happening here we're getting we're getting somewhere.",
    "We're cleaning things up.",
    "I also like to use the lasso an airbrush combination or things like nostrils and.",
    "The space in between the mouth, so let me show you an example.",
    "So I'm going to make a selection of the nostril shape.",
    "Because generally when you're painting noses an nostrils.",
    "You'll get the effect where there's a dark shadow.",
    "You're seeing like up inside the nose and so you'll get a dark shadow that kind of fades out so if you make a selection, but select more than you need on the bottom half, so you just get a hard edge on Top you can do something like this.",
    "Just using the airbrush to shade in.",
    "And then let the bottom the Microsoft sort of dissolve and then deselect and you have something like this.",
    "And we need to do more.",
    "More work on the nose, but not realize I think it's pretty fast way to do that.",
    "Grampa airbrush racer OK and then for the.",
    "For the lips for the mouth.",
    "You can do something similar and just make a selection tracing along what you want to be the.",
    "The bottom of the Top lip for example.",
    "And then when you have this election need.",
    "And you can hold the shift to add to your selection and all to subtract from it.",
    "Once you have your selection.",
    "You can then take the Airbrush and just kind of run it along there.",
    "And then deselect and you have.",
    "Align.",
    "Sometimes they'll take me a couple goes you know to decide what shape I want you can use warp and move it around sometimes you get it, the first time.",
    "Sometimes not.",
    "Um charity has more character thank you.",
    "What is your favorite tool in Photoshop except the brush tool?",
    "Well, this might be?",
    "This might be an obvious answer at the moment but probably the lasso tool probably the last air tool.",
    "I guess also having layers of course, I also do traditional art so I.",
    "Yeah, in traditional art, I missed having layers for sure.",
    "So I mean, you can layer things.",
    "But you can't then go and take a layer from your background of your traditional painting and move it around so it would probably be either having layers or the lasso tool.",
    "I use those both like obviously constantly.",
    "Unbelievable, I was killed myself to make it knows Oh well.",
    "I hope that I hope you can use this.",
    "I hope you can use this.",
    "It's yeah, it was really handy for me.",
    "Also, the eyelids.",
    "You can do something similar so let me make a selection above the eyelid for example, got a hard edge, there now we can take the.",
    "The Airbrush and just go along the edge of the eyelid and deselect so you can see the before and after you can also see that there's a big?",
    "Different sometimes in the lasso tool versus the brush that it's not so smooth, sometimes you get little like aliased edges, you can just use the?",
    "It's much brush to soften it.",
    "Control Z for you read.",
    "I know control Z is definitely something I miss in traditional, although to be honest.",
    "I don't miss it as much as some other things because I I painted in Gouache, so mostly I can paint over if I make a mistake.",
    "So it's not so much the end of the world I missed some of the other convenience tools, even more than controls the older that's of course, a big one.",
    "Yeah, so yeah, I'm glad that helps yeah, so you can you can use that kind of method to add it's like a bit of a spray paints kind of approach and you can do it below the lips.",
    "I would really suggest, though I mean, depending on what style you want I would suggest using the.",
    "Airbrush airbrush lasso tool combination with the smudge tool because you're just going to end up with some really, really hard edges and you might want to have a smudge brush to go back in and soften it.",
    "I like the combination of I like having a smudge brush where you can soften in some places an leave a hard edge in other places, if you want to.",
    "You don't have to completely soften it everywhere.",
    "You can leave leave a hard edge that kind of fades.",
    "So.",
    "I'm too often like I want to try this, but if I ruin everything.",
    "Yeah, sometimes if I'm painting and environment and you have your whole background and then you're going to add like one tree in front like Bob Ross style.",
    "That's always.",
    "Nerve wracking moments and there's Photoshop.",
    "It's like no problem.",
    "We can just move it.",
    "Erase delay take away the layer and release it.",
    "Definitely.",
    "OK, so we've got.",
    "A face we'd still need to do more here, but It's going I'm just noticing now also her.",
    "Her eyelids, I'd like to move them up a little bit more.",
    "This is another fun thing to do in photo shop, so I copied her eyelid onto a new layer.",
    "There's many ways to do this you can just use liquify tool or something but I just found that I like to do it this way.",
    "So I copied her bottom eyelid on to a new layer and just kind of warped it and pulled it up over Top of her eye.",
    "A little bit.",
    "She just has this little bit of a squint you know it's kind of like the typical model squint going on.",
    "And so I didn't really get that in my initial painting.",
    "So yeah, I pulled her.",
    "I let her eyelid bottom eyelid up over a little bit and I think it gives her a better.",
    "You know squint.",
    "So that's fine will use that?",
    "So let's zoom out, we've been zoomed in for awhile as much as I'm actually really enjoying working on the face.",
    "I want to work on this whole image and what I was saying earlier is it's important to work around the image and not get too zoned in on one area and leave other areas neglected in your painting so.",
    "I'm going to keep going.",
    "But we're going to stay zoomed out and I will paint with the whole scene in mind, not just her, her face.",
    "So I will do a little bit more painting on her.",
    "Her head, but we're staying zoomed out or staying zoomed out for a bit.",
    "And we're going to work on the outfit too.",
    "She has this little leaf tucked by her ear, I didn't even paint that in yet.",
    "That's going to be something to do soon I think.",
    "We see up in between her, her, her apart.",
    "So let's give a little peek like that.",
    "And maybe a little bit more at the Top of her head.",
    "Keep going back and forth 'cause earlier, I had painted in too much.",
    "Earlier, I had too much hair.",
    "Now, not enough.",
    "High rock is how are you?",
    "We can add a little bit of machine to the hair, too.",
    "There's like a grey grey blue highlight nice shines or her hair and around her part.",
    "You can give the look that her hair like sort of curls around.",
    "There's a lot of different ways, you can do this since I was kind of showing this whole lasso tool technique.",
    "I can show a way that you can use that for this purpose.",
    "You can take your lasso tool and make like a shape you can kind of make a squiggly shape.",
    "If you want to have a lot of little hair strands, catching the light so you can just kind of.",
    "Do this.",
    "And maybe some of these curling ones, and then let's pick, a Gray we've got our airbrush and.",
    "Just paint in lately.",
    "And usually want the darkest part being around the middle of that and then you have.",
    "A little.",
    "Shine in the hair now in the past.",
    "I've done some stylized almost like anime style artwork.",
    "San in this case, I would leave the shine very.",
    "Sharp.",
    "But for something like this, I think it's nice to blur it out a little bit.",
    "'cause I'm trying to paint.",
    "Yeah, I'm not trying to paint in the anime style or something at the moment.",
    "This reference is not hard it's a really hard.",
    "I'm so sorry uh.",
    "I'm definitely I'm definitely feeling that this is a difficult one like I keep looking at her and.",
    "Yeah, I'm just going to keep going.",
    "Hum what did you think of the 2 Wallpapers.",
    "I shared in discord?",
    "I don't think I saw them Reaper?",
    "I'm sorry?",
    "You can post one in the chat if you want me to take a look at it.",
    "I don't always see everything in there, you can always tag me if you like really want to make sure that I don't miss something though.",
    "You guys give me one quick moment I need to grab a tissue.",
    "I'm still here.",
    "Well, I'll be.",
    "I'll be right back.",
    "I'll just be a quick moment.",
    "OK thanks for waiting.",
    "Let me check the link of rebirth shared.",
    "Oh, this is cool.",
    "So what is the symbol from?",
    "It says in the URL Empire emblem, so I'm not sure what that is if it's a game or something but this is really cool.",
    "I like the texture on this.",
    "It makes it look very old like it's from like an old temple or something.",
    "Really really pretty warm and cool colors.",
    "Yeah, I like that, a lot, that's a very nice looking wallpaper.",
    "OK let's let's keep going on the painting.",
    "Let's take a look again at our curves.",
    "I feel like I want to.",
    "I don't know.",
    "I was going to keep painting I do want to darken things but I'm not sure.",
    "It was from Star Wars Nice.",
    "Some kind of not really super in the loop with Star Wars I've seen like the classic movies.",
    "But.",
    "It's been awhile.",
    "I haven't really kept up with the new ones.",
    "OK.",
    "Let's Let's go.",
    "So new layer I think it is finally time I know I said that earlier, but I think it's finally time I can start using some more interesting brushes.",
    "Let's see how it goes.",
    "Hopefully it's not going to flatten things out.",
    "I find it easier to get a 3D look to my work when I use the airbrush, but I really want to enjoy some more textures in my work so.",
    "This was my whole plan.",
    "Let's see how it goes.",
    "The idea was start with the Airbrush.",
    "So you can use it as a tool that I find pretty effective for shading.",
    "And then at some point.",
    "Like now for example, we're going to switch to continuing our rendering with some textured brushes and there's variety of different brushes.",
    "That I have that are supposed to emulate traditional kinds of textures, so I'm just going to.",
    "I'm just going to take a couple moments to try things out and find one that I think is going to work well for this type of texture of her sweater.",
    "I'm trying your textured brush from your free brushes.",
    "Um there's a texture paint and let's see.",
    "Rectangle texture.",
    "I'm not sure which one exactly you're using I have.",
    "I changed the names of the brushes at one point from one of the old versions of the brush pack to one of the newer ones.",
    "I changed the name 'cause.",
    "I was trying to make them a little bit more.",
    "Descriptive some of the original names were not very helpful.",
    "Do you only painting or other work in designing only painting illustrate illustration?",
    "I don't do design work?",
    "I don't really have any specific knowledge in that area, so while I have done a couple.",
    "I have done some logos and things in the past they were more illustrated logos.",
    "Not very designed logo so for example, I did the type of logo where there was an illustration of the person in the logo like if you know the brands like the Quaker Oats guy or Aunt Jemima or something like that.",
    "Those brands that have like a portrait in their logo.",
    "I've done a couple like.",
    "A few of those type of designs for people that wanted that.",
    "But other than that I don't do like a nice clean style logos or that type of design.",
    "It takes a whole different area of expertise, which I would.",
    "I would it would be really awesome to be able to do.",
    "But.",
    "Yeah, it's not something that I do.",
    "My passion is more in painting, though I do appreciate good design.",
    "And I'd super handy to be able to do as well because a lot of artists are also you're kind of your own.",
    "You need to be your own brand and marketing and everything so.",
    "Being able to create some of those things for Yourself is really nice.",
    "That's something that I found a little difficult over the years.",
    "OK, so I don't know that I'm really loving this texture, yet, but part of the issue.",
    "Is sometimes when you first introduce a new texture?",
    "It looks really wrong when there's only one area that's utilizing that texture.",
    "Sometimes you gotta commit a little bit more.",
    "And before you can really tell what it's going to look like I have the feeling that if I keep going.",
    "We're going to get better results.",
    "Then just looking at one little corner.",
    "Another thing that I have.",
    "Learned and I'm trying to put into effect is the idea that you don't have to paint detail everywhere.",
    "You can leave some areas pretty smooth and you can focus your areas of detail and texture in places in the painting where well basically there's 2 main places.",
    "You can focus your detail and texture.",
    "One is anywhere near your focal point, so for example, the focal point will be her face and around her face.",
    "The more complicated area of the painting is her hand or face maybe these Flowers.",
    "Leaves to the side of her so anything up here.",
    "We want to focus more detail and more time and more texture.",
    "And so like her sweater near her hand that will be probably the most detailed part of the sweater that we paint.",
    "Also anywhere where there's high contrast.",
    "Where there's a transition between Shadow and highlight that's also a good opportunity to show texture because the texture becomes more obvious in that area, so those are 2 places where I'm going to try to focus my painting of the texture of the sweater.",
    "And we'll see we'll see how that goes.",
    "If you end up painting equal texture everywhere, you end up with.",
    "Well, either you could end up with maybe like a very, very realistic.",
    "Looking painting if you're going for hyper realism or you really want.",
    "That level of detail but sometimes it can also detract from your focal point because you really want.",
    "One area of painting.",
    "One area of your painting to catch the eye of your viewer and be like the area that they engaged with first.",
    "And so having that one area be more detailed and more.",
    "More textured more contrast more interesting and that's going to benefit you.",
    "So there's a lot of good reasons, not to over do it with the detail not to mention we could save some time maybe.",
    "I'm flipping my canvas a lot.",
    "I do this mostly when I'm painting portraits.",
    "I'll still do it.",
    "When I'm painting environments.",
    "But when I do portraits.",
    "That's when you really see me, flipping the canvas.",
    "All the time so I hope it's not annoying to watch it.",
    "So it helps me see mistakes more easily.",
    "When you're looking at something for awhile sometimes you.",
    "I don't know if your brain like stop seeing things anymore.",
    "When you flip the canvas it kind of tricks your brain into reprocessing the image and you can see, things a little differently.",
    "Sometimes that's when you'll notice that something is a little bit wonky.",
    "So I've done all this detailing on a separate layer.",
    "'cause I wasn't sure how is going to like it?",
    "I didn't know if I wanted to commit to this.",
    "Method.",
    "One thing you can do is lower, the Opacity and that takes away some of the intensity.",
    "I really like, how it looks here.",
    "But I'm not a big fan of this area.",
    "I think maybe I just started to get more of the hang of it as I went on, but",
    "One thing I could do is maybe erase out or soften the shoulder or just take it away.",
    "Maybe I should just.",
    "Yeah, I get rid of that didn't really like, how it looked.",
    "Hey geovanna, um more vector illustration person, but sometimes it miss, this character.",
    "That's painted textures, brain do you have any specific tips to help with that?",
    "Well, uhm.",
    "I'm not very experienced with vector illustration so.",
    "I don't know, um about.",
    "I mean, I'd love to help but I don't know if I have any good tips for bringing textures into vector illustration just because I don't do much of that.",
    "Hum.",
    "But.",
    "If you're if you're just talking about in painting in general.",
    "Uhm I could suggest maybe playing with some different.",
    "Playing with some different brushes or playing with some different like you can clip some textures or patterns on to your like if you do more stylized work or if you do more like in vector work.",
    "Maybe you can still clip some kind of.",
    "Textures are patterns on Top of some of your characters, either like clothing or hair or something where it might fit.",
    "So the for flipping the canvas.",
    "You have to set up the shortcut.",
    "It's not automatically a shortcut by default Sebastian, but if you go to edit.",
    "Keyboard shortcuts.",
    "You can set it up for yourself, it's under.",
    "Let's see I think it's under tools hold on.",
    "Let me see if I can find a real quick.",
    "220.",
    "No, it's under.",
    "Application menus that's right so you can go to image.",
    "Flip horizontal so yeah.",
    "Application menus.",
    "And then Scroll down to image flip horizontal and I set it to control F because I feel like that's pretty easy to remember for flip.",
    "But you could pick something else.",
    "Now this flips your whole canvas.",
    "There's another shortcut.",
    "You can also use if you like.",
    "You can go to view instead of flipping the whole canvas you can go to view.",
    "And there should be a I may have just scrolled past it, but there's a way to flip your view horizontally.",
    "And this yeah, here we go flip horizontal you can use this, if you want instead and it will be a little bit easier on your computer to do it.",
    "This way or its uses less processing power because it's kind of flipping the view.",
    "It's not really like actually flipping your canvas so if you ever are working with like tons of layers and you find that flipping your canvas is causing a big lag you can choose this instead and then?",
    "It will be a little bit better.",
    "Hey George welcome.",
    "OK, so I'm going to keep going.",
    "With this little texture up here.",
    "But I'm not quite sold that this is the right.",
    "But this is the right texture for me to use this feels extremely labor intensive which maybe it just might be.",
    "Maybe it might be to paint this way.",
    "But I think it's more an issue of I haven't figured out the right balance of.",
    "How much texture to have or not have in this in this painting yet?",
    "I also have a brush called rectangle texture.",
    "That's has some texture to it, but it's more of A.",
    "Brush that I used to block things in this could be a nice one because it has a harder edge.",
    "So it's not.",
    "Going to leave so many of these ragged paintbrush stipends.",
    "Thanks anyway, my experiment painting, some textures are vectors using your brushes see how that goes you have that could be fun.",
    "Yeah, I'm sorry.",
    "I wasn't able to give a good.",
    "Good advice for vector painting, but that could be that could be something that might work worth trying anyway, sometimes when you try something new like that, it gives you another idea you know anytime you experiment like that.",
    "Even if it doesn't work, maybe trigger some other kind of idea for you.",
    "OK, I kind of like this sort of stylised.",
    "Pattern.",
    "With the square brush.",
    "Doesn't necessarily look super realistic but?",
    "It has something cool.",
    "Um.",
    "Jackson says they have the flip canvas shortcut on F4I use it pretty much every 5 minutes or even less.",
    "I think I'm using it really often.",
    "I think I'm using it really often.",
    "Oh.",
    "I'm glad I'm not the only one.",
    "It's only when I'm streaming is I get a little bit self conscious about it.",
    "'cause I feel like you guys are like watching a little dance over here, she's moving.",
    "All you're welcome.",
    "Hi Ahmed love your painting Oh.",
    "Thank you like you're touching designs is a very kind of you thank you.",
    "Today we're doing something a little bit different.",
    "Maybe I'm trying to study the.",
    "The folds and textures on her sweater, I don't usually paint.",
    "I don't usually paint so detailed when it comes to clothing.",
    "We were talking about earlier.",
    "I usually like to kind of tone down the folds and things, including 'cause.",
    "I find it to be sometimes really distracting from the character, but I'm trying to get better with these textures.",
    "So we're practicing this anybody who wants to you're welcome to grab the reference image and do a little study with us.",
    "If you feel inspired if you like the reference you can join in.",
    "And you're welcome to share any.",
    "Paintings or sketches, you do.",
    "In the chat.",
    "I'm going to be working on this for probably a few hours say.",
    "Let's see how long has it been.",
    "We've been.",
    "Working on this for a little under 2 hours.",
    "Now we started from a blank page.",
    "At the beginning of this stream so if anybody missed the beginning and you're curious how we got here, you can always check it out later after the stream is done.",
    "If you go to my page here on Behance.",
    "There's a videos tab and you can see all the past livestreams and it's really nice.",
    "There's a tool timeline that I have running here.",
    "So later when you're watching if you watch the replay.",
    "You'll see whatever tools.",
    "I'm using the tool timeline is going to show that so there's one really nice thing about watching the replays actually but yeah, you can see this from the beginning, but I'm going to be working on it for a bit longer.",
    "I hope to take this through a nice.",
    "And Nice.",
    "Somewhat level of Polish by the end of stream.",
    "Within reason you know, there's only so much you can do with the.",
    "4 or 5 hours but.",
    "I think we can I think we've gotten through some of the more difficult parts of this and we can have fun with polishing it up and making it look nice.",
    "Now we're just doing texturing.",
    "Um Hey bam, how are you?",
    "I hope you're having a good day mill says I prefer regular flipping.",
    "I think it helps learn more about composition and balance.",
    "OK, cool.",
    "Well, I'm glad you think I'm glad you feel that way, and it's not annoying.",
    "It definitely helps me so.",
    "I like this.",
    "I like what the texture is doing here, although I have to admit, I don't know if it's coming across to you guys, but the texture.",
    "I'm giving to her shirt is making it look almost like she has sequins on her shirt or that it's made from a more reflective kind of material.",
    "I don't really mind that so much.",
    "My concern is more with making the folds look good, then that the texture of material looks exactly like the reference.",
    "It's kind of glamorous.",
    "I like it was looking a little shiny.",
    "We're given her whole new outfit.",
    "We'll see how it goes by the time we end up putting another layer of.",
    "Of detailing in my we may end up giving some texture that makes it look more soft again.",
    "It's definitely having a better reflective quality right now.",
    "So there's a theme here.",
    "I don't know if I should bother with it or not.",
    "I know I really like painting, shiny textures.",
    "They're just fun just fun to paint.",
    "So she got a little seem here on the sweater.",
    "And.",
    "See no problem, including it.",
    "All breaking art I'm sorry, you're feeling sick.",
    "Well, I guess on the bright side we get to hang out with you today.",
    "But I hope you feel better.",
    "Yeah, it's nice it's nice.",
    "I enjoy streaming here and on switch there's a few things that I really like about streaming on be hands.",
    "I was just talking about one a few minutes ago so I'm sorry if you already heard me talking about this.",
    "But there's a really cool feature here called the tool timeline behind so some ways of like integrating the stream with photo shop so this plugin is like capturing my tools that I'm using like the colours that I'm picking.",
    "Different things like that and.",
    "If you watch the replay of the stream later you'll be able to see a replay of along with the video of all the tools that I'm using as I'm using them so if anybody's ever like having trouble following along or you want to learn a little bit more about that.",
    "That's a really, really handy tool.",
    "But yeah, it's been really nice.",
    "Usually, when I'm streaming here on Wednesdays, I take a little bit more of a less of a speed painting approach and I try to.",
    "To spend a little bit more time on an individual painting, I do a lot of.",
    "Quick studies overall, but I like to take some time and.",
    "Go through more of a full process and it's nice to be able to show some more of the finishing.",
    "Affects and things and you guys always welcome to ask if I do something and you wanted to know what I did I tried to explain things as I go, but sometimes I miss stuff so.",
    "Yeah, if you turn this later on, and off.",
    "We're just seeing the progress I think it's really fun to work on the separate layer like that and be able to.",
    "Yeah, it's like the little layer visibility on and off and see the progress.",
    "It's a bit encouraging 'cause otherwise, it kind of feels like you're just detailing forever, but Hey Sarah, how are you?",
    "I was thinking about you the other day.",
    "I was drinking some of that rose tea.",
    "It's really good it smells really good.",
    "Or afternoon, yeah, we are in the afternoon now at least where I am I know a lot of us are in very different places different time zones.",
    "I'm in the Netherlands so I'm in.",
    "C ET time for anyone wondering.",
    "I'm originally from the US so.",
    "I spent most of my life in EST time I grew up in Florida and spent most of my life there so.",
    "Alright, you also like rose tea, yeah, thanks to thanks to bail.",
    "I was introduced to it.",
    "How are you keeping the reference image on the left the reference images?",
    "I'm using something called pure ref.",
    "So.",
    "You can Google, it there's the name it's separate from photo shop and it is.",
    "You can download it's technically free or you can make a donation when you download it so.",
    "It's really, really handy for making reference boards mood boards, putting holding a reference above your other software and things like that.",
    "Oh man.",
    "I'm sorry bill I had a kind of rough night of sleep couple nights ago.",
    "I'm sorry to hear that.",
    "Yeah, no problem.",
    "OK, so I'm starting to feel like we've been working on the sweater for a little while now.",
    "As I was saying earlier.",
    "I like to work around the painting and not spend too long on any one area and then let the other areas kind of fall behind.",
    "I want them to all be kind of working up towards a finished place with a relatively equal level of Polish as they go.",
    "I still feel like the sweater needs a lot of work.",
    "But I probably will just spend a little bit longer on it, and then go back and work on the face a little bit more.",
    "It's also just a personal preference thing I feel that I keep from getting bored on longer projects by moving around like that.",
    "I think if I if I stick rendering.",
    "One area for too long, especially when it's sort of a just a texture like what I'm doing here.",
    "I kind of can get a little burned out on that so.",
    "We're going to.",
    "Move around seeing here soon.",
    "Oh my gosh that's so cool red, I didn't realize that about you.",
    "That's very interesting.",
    "Yeah, it's kind of new to me, but I like it.",
    "I've always liked the scent but.",
    "OK.",
    "So the one area that's bothering me is these shadows here.",
    "I think if we can improve.",
    "This then I'll be happy to move on.",
    "These shadows are just I guess a little bit, too, dark or something.",
    "Hum.",
    "Maybe it's OK for them to have dark shadows, but not quite that much.",
    "I don't know it's just really attracting my attention.",
    "Take these little shadows.",
    "Jackson hi how are you?",
    "Welcome.",
    "You guys are welcome to correct me if I miss pronounce any of your names.",
    "Please do.",
    "Quick question how do you flip image high Andres you can set it up as a keyboard shortcut it's not a default one but if you go to image.",
    "Oh, sorry wrong?",
    "Don't go to image go to edit keyboard shortcuts and then you can go to panel menus.",
    "And then I use.",
    "A merit, yeah, yeah, let's see.",
    "Am I telling you to go to the wrong place.",
    "I literally just did this Oh application menus.",
    "OK.",
    "Go to application menus.",
    "Go to application menus and then you can go through image.",
    "Image rotation.",
    "I can.",
    "Go to flip canvas horizontal and press.",
    "CTRL F if you want the same shortcut that I have.",
    "I just like CTRL F because it's very easy to remember for flip?",
    "It's just one of those things that I set up and then I don't usually have to go back to it.",
    "Once you set it up, you're good to go you know.",
    "Anyway let's go back to the painting.",
    "I just want to try to fix this one area and then we'll.",
    "Work on the face of it more.",
    "Oh, you're welcome, I hope it helps I use that all the time it's like one of my most used.",
    "Shortcuts.",
    "You can certainly go to image image rotation flip horizontal you can do it.",
    "This way too.",
    "But if you use it as much as I do you're probably going to want to set shortcut for it.",
    "Well, if anybody is working on this one, I hope it's going OK.",
    "I hope it's going well.",
    "Even I find that's references.",
    "Is a pretty tricky one with a lot of details so?",
    "I'm trying to just enjoy enjoy the process.",
    "Enjoy the learning process.",
    "OK, well, I think I finally I'm going to merge this down you guys that's a big move.",
    "Big move so this has been on its own layer, but I think I'm committed enough to this texture.",
    "I'm just going to merge it down so my layers, so far consist of the background.",
    "The.",
    "Person and the sketch, which is now really not used anymore.",
    "I have the layer visibility turned off for it, but I'm just saving it because.",
    "I don't know sometimes I like to refer back to the sketch at some point.",
    "Hi Emily welcome.",
    "Flipping is the best thing to check your drawing.",
    "Yeah, it's super helpful another thing.",
    "I like to do is turn.",
    "My artwork into black and white and that will help see what's going on with your values like the darks and lights in your painting before even turning it into black and white.",
    "I am already aware that her face needs brighter highlights.",
    "I basically have worked on the.",
    "The sweater, but not her face for awhile now but it becomes even more obvious if you if you turn your reference into black and white and the.",
    "Yeah, if I look at the reference.",
    "Versus my painting, you can really see the difference it needs more contrast and more brightness, but it will get there.",
    "So Hi Richard Welcome.",
    "Oh, Noes avenged I'm sorry.",
    "Thanks Oliver I'm glad you like it.",
    "It's going somewhere took some liberties on this one.",
    "I do not blame you and that's not a bad thing.",
    "OK, so.",
    "I'm just going to have a little sympathy here and think about my next moves.",
    "OK, we're going to work on her face.",
    "We're going to zoom in.",
    "I'm going to zoom in I try not to zoom in too much.",
    "But when it comes to painting the face.",
    "We're going to finally do it.",
    "So we will make a new layer and paint on that layer to make adjustments and things because I think it's just feels a little safer feel a little safer in case we don't like what we do, we can.",
    "You know change it, so we don't have to commit yet so her finger as you can see in the reference or fingers, pushing in under her cheekbone kind of where your Kind of where you're like, maybe a dimple would be anyway, so.",
    "I'm just going to.",
    "Give her a little bit more dramatic.",
    "Like impression of the finger.",
    "The sweater texture is amazing.",
    "I love it.",
    "Yay I'm glad you like it.",
    "I feel like it looks a bit more reflective than the photo, but I kind of like I think it's kind of cool, it looks.",
    "I don't know I think has a glamorous kind of look.",
    "It's a little.",
    "It's a little bit different, maybe but I like it so I'm going to go with it.",
    "Um wanted to paint the girl with the Yellow Shirt but then you said.",
    "You chose this ref and I was like OK.",
    "I'm gonna do this Oh.",
    "I'm I picked the hard one.",
    "It is a pretty one, though, isn't it?",
    "Uhm I have some ideas, I have some ideas bail.",
    "I don't usually.",
    "Riville them anyway and when we get closer I will I will.",
    "Maybe talk about some things.",
    "But I usually like to have mostly surprise anyway.",
    "But yeah, that's crazy that that is.",
    "Coming up so soon.",
    "Looks like crushed velvet, but also it's needed.",
    "Well, thank you.",
    "So I'm using the airbrush to start with when I feel a little bit happier with the overall.",
    "Color shading highlights on her face then I will probably switch to a harder brush for more texture.",
    "But right now, we're still I'm like still trying to be satisfied with her face structure and overall where the colors and things are so once that's sorted out, then will probably move away from the.",
    "The Airbrush just like we did with her jacket sweater.",
    "So she has a bit of a shadow under her, her eye and it's not like she has.",
    "I mean to me, it just looks like the shape of her.",
    "As the shape of her eyelid.",
    "It's not so much that she has circles or bags under her eyes.",
    "It's a combination of her eye shape and that she's squinting a little bit.",
    "So if we do want to get that Squint feeling then we have to go ahead and like include this shadow under here.",
    "So we don't over do it.",
    "'cause then I think it will make her look like she's tired or something.",
    "But a little bit of it is just going to give us a proper amount of squint I hope.",
    "I thought it was a waffle texture, but it's not it might just be hungry.",
    "I could go for a waffle right now, I don't blame you.",
    "I do not blame you.",
    "And Hey Clever, Give a little highlight to her nose kind of pop that out, a little bit.",
    "So I want to get this little wing of her nose over here on this side, so that her nose looks more symmetrical.",
    "Yeah, before and after.",
    "Maybe I invented things a little too much over here.",
    "So I'm using airbrush I'm just color picking I'm holding alts to bring up the color.",
    "Picker and dragging colors, a little bit back and forth across each other, too, like blend the colors together and.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Quite refined for 2 hours of work very nice glad I got to see the sweater details all thank you.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Yeah, you're right, it's not too bad for 2 hours earlier.",
    "I was feeling a bit.",
    "Oh man she had.",
    "We had a bit of a ugly stage at the early part of this painting with the you know, blocking in her face and everything you know how it is.",
    "But.",
    "We're getting through we're getting through there, I'm feeling better about it now thank you.",
    "Little shadow to the eyebrows.",
    "It's also nice to use I was talking about this earlier, but you can use layer blending modes like multiply and that way.",
    "When you add a little bit more shadow for example, around the.",
    "The eye or the eyelid if you want to add some more depth to that it will add the darkness, but not completely cover?",
    "What you've already painted as if you were painting on a normal layer that might just kind of cover it up, but using multiply or something it still leaves that detail there and just kind of adds to it.",
    "So I like to use it.",
    "When I've already painted a bit and I just want to modify things slightly.",
    "And her mouth definitely needs.",
    "I need to get in there and paint you can actually see.",
    "Sort of into her, her mouth a little bit her lips are parted so we're going to want to get zoom in there and paint that.",
    "I'll pick a little bit more of a saturated color for around the lips.",
    "So are you guys at all familiar with.",
    "Color zones when it comes to painting portraits or faces or anything like that.",
    "This is something that was relatively new to me over the past couple years I started learning about this.",
    "Via just online tutorials and things and I can show a quick example of what I'm talking about 'cause I think it might be easier than.",
    "Trying to Explain it with words.",
    "So this would be a quick example.",
    "Of the color zones if you see if you take a look at paintings, especially like classical oil paintings.",
    "You'll see that.",
    "Even though this is a very dramatic.",
    "Example, a lot of times these areas, the face will have a slight tint to them.",
    "I can put the link to this in the chat in case anybody wants to look more closely.",
    "But the idea is to give a little bit more life to the skin.",
    "You can pay attention to those zones when you're shading.",
    "And sometimes it's just it can be overdone.",
    "So you don't want to go too far with it, but I've noticed that can really help.",
    "Struggle on the lower part of the face like shading the sides of the mouth.",
    "Chin lower cheek.",
    "Part yeah that's really hard in this one revenge because of her hand.",
    "Blocking I should actually start painting her hand next because surprise surprise.",
    "That's the part.",
    "I'm procrastinating on and I can't really figure out any of the other areas of behind there.",
    "Until I figure out how much the hand is going to be blocking for example, but",
    "Well let's get to that, but well before we do that.",
    "I'll do one will put a layer on either overlay or soft light and we can do a little bit of shading with the color zones in mind, so for example, we can give a little bit more yellow Hue through the upper part of her head.",
    "The knows we can go a little bit of pink.",
    "Really useful the head color map, yeah, Pedro is really interesting and I've seen examples.",
    "If you guys are curious to look into that more you can also find online you can find color Maps for things like the hands as well, and legs and all areas of the body have these different tendencies towards a slightly different hues.",
    "And the blue one is a little bit odd but.",
    "Yeah, so here's a before and after before and after.",
    "You can lower the opacity a little bit, but it just gives a little bit more life to the skin.",
    "Your right hand cover so I used this.",
    "It's to make my hand glide Morse movie on my tablet.",
    "I'm using a Wakame Centriq 22.",
    "And it has a glass screen an I find that sometimes my hand will like kind of just get stuck a little bit on the glass.",
    "If you wear a glove or something then you can draw very smoothly and it's more comfortable.",
    "It also helps prevent smudges and things on the tablet, but really for me, it's more of a just ease of ease of painting.",
    "The reason that I wear it.",
    "Alright so let's start painting her hand.",
    "Finally we will do this on a new layer.",
    "Of course in case case.",
    "You don't like how it looks.",
    "I'm going to use this soft brush from earlier and.",
    "Just start trying to block in the individual fingers a little bit more and I'll paint around the outside.",
    "Of them, yeah, we just want to establish establish the shape of the fingers a little bit better.",
    "So this one is a little tricky.",
    "I'm going to keep them pretty light.",
    "Until the next step.",
    "So one thing that I found it really helpful with drawing fingers and hands of a specifically fingers is to think of them more as I used to think of fingers more rounded, but now I think of them more in as like.",
    "Cubes are rectangles like for example.",
    "Speaker brush that's less transparent this side of the finger.",
    "Is separate from or has a sharp edge from this side?",
    "It makes the fingers more easy to read if you can really separate the Top and the side of them so there's there's different ways to go about this.",
    "But just even thinking of it.",
    "That way when you're working can help I think.",
    "The very tip, is going to be a little bit more rounded but.",
    "The rest of the way down the fingers.",
    "Is more of a solid shape?",
    "So I'm going to go back to the lasso tool airbrush for this.",
    "Let's make a new layer.",
    "And grab the Airbrush got my lasso tool.",
    "So I'm going to make a selection tracing around the shape of the finger going to start with the furthest one.",
    "And get the whole finger.",
    "An on a new layer.",
    "The left side is a bit.",
    "Darker and then towards the her finger her hand is as it's facing towards us.",
    "The light as is hitting her cheek is also affecting your hand the same way so that bright light will also hit her finger.",
    "So we get this kind of highlight so we get this side of the finger and Shadow and the side facing us in the light.",
    "And if we deselect you have something like this now, it's going to look a little bit, silly at first until we go in and paint details.",
    "It's going to look like plastic.",
    "Hot dog fingers or something but it's OK.",
    "We will we will make it better.",
    "It's just a step one and I think it's a little easier to do it.",
    "This way, so let's go to the next finger.",
    "An I will just do the same thing again take the lasso tool and select all the way will select the knuckle at the end and select all the way around the finger.",
    "And then Take a you can either do this on a separate layer from the first finger.",
    "If you want or on the same layer kind of just depends on how confident you feel about this.",
    "And then choose what color you want for the shadow.",
    "And just start painting that in and then as the.",
    "As you go around to the side you can shift to the highlight.",
    "So we can see where it's kind of hitting this knuckle here.",
    "Bring it down like this.",
    "Tee time enjoy your tea.",
    "Here's I'll have a sip as well.",
    "OK, so if I deselect then we have another finger and I will also.",
    "Select this space in between the fingers here.",
    "Put a shadow.",
    "We can add a bit of red to it 'cause there's kind of a glow from the skin.",
    "So of course again modify things if you can give me made the Anatomy, a little off, you can just change that, especially if they're on separate layers is pretty easy to modify.",
    "OK let's go to the next one next finger.",
    "Make a selection this one we don't really see the knuckle 'cause.",
    "It's kind of tucking under the sweater.",
    "I think my sweater needs to go up a little bit higher actually 'cause it's not going to cover that.",
    "Alright we'll get to that next.",
    "So we see the angle of the finger here.",
    "And this one is all pretty light so.",
    "We'll go from light to later this finger is getting really bright if you look at the photo.",
    "The hand and the sweater are like the same bright NIS the finger.",
    "Colour and her skin is reflecting.",
    "Really really bright there so.",
    "You can go really bright.",
    "So I'm going to go to my lower layer with the sweater on it an make a selection.",
    "Of a big piece big chunk of sweater and bring that layer on Top.",
    "We're going to go to edit transform warp and just kind of pull it up like this.",
    "Just drag it up like that, so now this is on Top of the layers with the.",
    "On Top of the.",
    "The fingers.",
    "Let's try one more time it it transform warp.",
    "Anne will decide how much I think I went a little overboard.",
    "That's enough OK.",
    "So let's go back to the fingers finger painting next one.",
    "So we see a little bit of shadow in between them here.",
    "So something like this and then the last little pinky finger.",
    "Comes out and down.",
    "We can be really casual with painting this now, especially because we have that piece of the sweater.",
    "So I don't have to worry about that.",
    "You have to worry about the edge, I can just kind of paint right through its covered so.",
    "Pinky's a little odd.",
    "But this is basically just a block in the basic.",
    "Shading of the fingers.",
    "Let's merge these.",
    "So these are all the fingers on one layer.",
    "We can make a layer underneath of that and do a little bit more shading under under the fingers.",
    "For example, before we merge it down to the face.",
    "It's more easy to paint underneath there right now, so.",
    "Anywhere, where her fingers are close to her skin.",
    "You might want to put in a little bit of extra.",
    "Like sort of drop shadow or?",
    "Something like that.",
    "Nice Cup, Oh thank you my Penguin.",
    "OK.",
    "Well, I think I'm ready to merge down the hand.",
    "If you think it's too bright or doesn't look natural.",
    "You can lower the opacity a little bit, it kind of blends with what was already painted there emerged that down.",
    "And then I'll also merge the sweater, so we're back to our two layers.",
    "We're back to her and the background and our little sketch, which were not really using anymore.",
    "OK.",
    "So let's go back to painting her face and her hand.",
    "We can just kind of go back in and now like refine what we've done a little bit and add like for example, there should be some little wrinkles at the creases of these.",
    "In these with these fingers.",
    "Here.",
    "You just Polish, it up.",
    "Polish it up, we can add a little bit more shadow between these.",
    "Knuckles and might even use the lasso tool here to block it off.",
    "He's a smudge brush to clear that a little bit.",
    "Got a little bit weird with that one finger now.",
    "OK, I think I see the problem.",
    "Let's choose a brush with some more a little bit more of a hard edge.",
    "And we need to define this.",
    "Sebastian says you prefer always to merge it has some advantage because I would have like a million layers.",
    "But it makes my file very heavy.",
    "I used to have that same thing Sebastian I used to save ice the kind of horrid layers a bit.",
    "There are advantages and disadvantages to both merging layers.",
    "Merging layers more often can help with what you're talking about your file will be less heavy.",
    "It won't take up as much hard drive space and it's just easier to work with you don't have to deal with as much lag.",
    "Potentially.",
    "If you are experiencing that depending on what kind of processing power you have with your computer.",
    "Uhm but for me if I'm talking about it nothing to do with technology and just to do with painting.",
    "I like to merge more often because I find that it helps me commit and move on.",
    "I used to have a very, very picky kind of slower way of painting and part of it was because of having all those layers.",
    "I would really kind of overthink decisions before making them I would want to save layers to constantly be able to make changes to things and there are advantages to that, but within reason.",
    "So for this painting, I think it's beneficial to me to have the character on a separate layer from the background.",
    "It makes it easier to make changes to them.",
    "Separately, an it's an advantage.",
    "I think to keep them separate but beyond that.",
    "I don't think it helps me to have like her hair on a different layer her hand on a different layer.",
    "I only keep them on different layers when it's I think useful to me to have them that way, and then at that point I will.",
    "I will just merge them when I feel like I like what I've done at that point.",
    "I'll merge them and move on and sometimes it is.",
    "Most of the time I think it's a good choice for me for my workflow every once in awhile I regret.",
    "The merge and I'll be like, Oh I wish I had that separate that would have been more useful, but most of the time I don't mind if I need to separate something I'll just use the lasso tool select it and just like copy it.",
    "You know layer new layer via copy or control J.",
    "You can separate something on to another layer so usually that'll be good enough for me.",
    "Mill says will you be illustrating the free part of the sweater or leaving that out?",
    "Do you mean like the little strands and things?",
    "Like if you look really close up.",
    "There's Tiny Little.",
    "Little strands like this, it depends I don't know to me.",
    "That's kind of like a finishing effect.",
    "So it just depends on how.",
    "I don't consider that like a super high priority compared to other things that I want to work on in the painting that would be like if I had enough time.",
    "Maybe I would add that in but that is not super super important to me because I'm not really going for like hyper realism.",
    "With my art, I am happy if you get the effect.",
    "From a distance like so from here, you really can see some of the fuzzy effects, but for the most part.",
    "You know you're not really going to see it so much until you zoom in so for me.",
    "If my painting reads well from like a full screen size that I'm happy.",
    "I'm probably not going to get into so, so many of the really minute.",
    "Details just 'cause I doubt there will be time for it, but We'll see what happens.",
    "Pedro said what really helped me about messy layers was to make whole pieces in one layer only just it was on an actual canvas also wait were you doing, traditional painting.",
    "But yeah, I've heard of a lot of artists doing like single layer painting challenges and things and I have done some of that in the past 2 with like quick studies nothing that I spent 2 too long on but.",
    "Yeah, I have done some things like that, and I think it's a good way to learn.",
    "A different workflow and maybe you like it, maybe you don't.",
    "I don't think there's like a right or wrong way, necessarily for certain art styles.",
    "It makes a lot of sense to keep things separate if you're doing something very clean and you have like a line art layer and then other clean layers.",
    "It's going to be really silly to merge them.",
    "Um let's see.",
    "Breaking arts those along time ago, adopted minimal minimum layer mindset after watching one of your streams.",
    "Now I work.",
    "A lot faster and work with confidence.",
    "That's awesome.",
    "I'm really glad to hear that it definitely helped me paint with more confidence.",
    "See it's not some leaves into your fabric folds.",
    "That's like the that's helping me get through it's helping me get through you know what I mean?",
    "Jackson says my take for now, let's see.",
    "Oh my gosh.",
    "That is amazing.",
    "Oh my gosh, Jackson.",
    "I gotta say, though this is awesome, like OK.",
    "This is a clever idea it looks good.",
    "It looks really good, I especially like this texture in the background.",
    "It kind of zig Zags in towards her and it kind of somehow echoes this.",
    "Zigzag in the fan compositionally this is really pretty love that gold reflective texture, the sweater looks really nice.",
    "Yeah, this is well done and being that this was not really a portrait study.",
    "It was a study of.",
    "Painting fabric folds.",
    "I think you are in the clear to block the face-off if you choose.",
    "Yeah, it's certainly a lot nicer looking than just leaving her face completely blank so that was a good compromise.",
    "Very clever pro tips how to avoid painting their face.",
    "Get really good at painting fans.",
    "I love it.",
    "Nicely done.",
    "So yeah, if any of you guys are watching and you'd like to join in with the painting like which accent said.",
    "You're welcome to join you also look like they just relax and hang out.",
    "But it's always fun to see different artstyles attempting the.",
    "The study reference.",
    "A lot of different takes on.",
    "On the theme.",
    "OK, so yeah, let's keep going.",
    "I'm going to just paint around the face and neck.",
    "I haven't really done much with that, but we actually do see the sweater back here.",
    "Some little details like that.",
    "It doesn't need to be super super clean.",
    "I'm OK with a little bit of a painterly effect.",
    "Pokey says out of Big Fluff of her in front.",
    "That's true Pokey Yeah, we can do suddenly it's very windy and there's like a rare swallowing like this Oh no.",
    "There's there's a lot of.",
    "Yeah, I've just hairs a cover I would just be honest.",
    "I've used her to couple cover up things I don't want to paint before for sure.",
    "Usually, it has to do with the neck.",
    "Anatomy and stuff like that, like just put a little hair there.",
    "Right yeah.",
    "I think every artist is guilty of that at some point.",
    "The classic hands in the pockets and stuff.",
    "You should see the other work in progress bar, Clovis started.",
    "There's not going to be a lot of faces.",
    "I don't blame you well.",
    "The thing is, it's very distracting from the.",
    "From the fabric like.",
    "It takes a lot of time to paint the face well and if you're trying to study something different.",
    "Then you kind of way away that and see if it's really worth it.",
    "She has a ponytail what about now.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Like you're putting that in your Commission rules, no ponytails.",
    "No characters with ponytails no characters with hands.",
    "OK, maybe we should paint this leaf up by her face because I'm just noticing.",
    "I don't know what to do around this area, she's got a little leaf.",
    "It's a decorative leaf.",
    "It looks like it has glitter on it or something it's really pretty.",
    "I'm curious if they made that it looks similar to the leaves that are.",
    "From the plants behind her.",
    "So I wonder if that was.",
    "DIY project or something this is really cool.",
    "Alright well, I'm just going to hand paint this little special, special tricks.",
    "If you want you could.",
    "Sketch it in first on a separate layer draw sketch and then paint it in.",
    "Sometimes I'll do that.",
    "Also, another tip, is sometimes for something like this, you can paint it if you're if you're just looking at the silhouette shape.",
    "You can paint it in any color and then modify that color you can use.",
    "You can use a?",
    "Block transparency or clipping mask to paint within this so if you want you can just choose a color.",
    "That's actually easy to see because the color of the leaf is like somewhat close door skin color so this is a little easier to see what you're doing, and then you can quickly change the color.",
    "There's no reason, it needs to be painted in the color that's going to be.",
    "So use my eraser to cut back in make some more interesting shape.",
    "And it looks crazy, but I think when we shade, it in it will look like a leaf.",
    "That's what we're hoping for.",
    "OK.",
    "So now we can lock the transparency press the little checkerboard icon up here and we can grab the airbrush or any brush and you can just fill in and only color so we're going to go for gold look.",
    "For this leaf so.",
    "When painting gold, it's important to note can look at the reference real quick goal when something looks gold.",
    "There's usually a lot of different hues involved in that thing so see, there's like yellow gold.",
    "There's like a bronzy orange.",
    "Sometimes there's like green tones.",
    "Gold objects usually have a lot of different little colors, reflecting its metallic it reflects the colors around.",
    "It also and if you want it to look shiny, then we want to put some areas of high contrast, so really brighten really dark areas.",
    "So, just picking ever just picking a color that looks gold is never going to quite do it.",
    "We've got to think a little bit more.",
    "So I think a little bit differently for that.",
    "So I will start just shading in based on the reference where I see some different colours, so there's more Brown and.",
    "This orangey red.",
    "I'm going up through more yellow gold.",
    "And at the end going a little bit more towards Green.",
    "But it's generally going to be like in olive green.",
    "The saturated kind of olive green that you see in gold jewelry and stuff, it's not usually like a bright green.",
    "OK so that's layer one.",
    "Let's Make a new layer and paint.",
    "I'm going to get a different texture brush.",
    "And colour pick from what we already have and let's go a little bit darker.",
    "And I want to start drawing the center line of belief this little ornament, she's wearing it has.",
    "You know the classic veins of the leaf kind of shape coming out like this.",
    "Something like that, you can also do this on a multiply layer if you want a more intense effect that could be nice.",
    "I will create a clipping mask so that I don't have to worry about painting in the lines.",
    "So that layer is attached onto the original.",
    "Sheep.",
    "Love how you splashed a few colors that it turned into a leave it really it really helps.",
    "It looked so crazy before it had any shading on it.",
    "Because I guess the colors in the shading help give the little bit more of the look of.",
    "Foreshortening.",
    "Alright I'm going to lower the opacity of that a little bit more 'cause I don't really like love love it.",
    "But it's a start.",
    "Make a new layer and do the same thing again.",
    "Sometimes these things just take a few.",
    "Whew.",
    "Steps.",
    "So I'm going to start adding in some of the highlights, though we want to start bringing in some of those bright.",
    "Bright reflections.",
    "So it's a little bit glittery.",
    "We've got some little glitters Here in there, so I'm just going to.",
    "Popping these little sequin effects.",
    "And over here.",
    "So again for something to look shiny.",
    "We need to go high contrast, so that means not just these bright lights, but also.",
    "Some.",
    "Some darker.",
    "Darker little flex also.",
    "So I am again, I'm using layers here.",
    "This is on a separate layer.",
    "It looks very because I've detailed this a lot more than anything around it.",
    "It's really stealing our attention away from her face because it's so detailed and crisp with all these hard edges and like noisy, so as soon as we're done with this.",
    "Leaf we're going to go back and work on her face more and detail that gives some little shines.",
    "Actually, we could probably just go ahead and do that now and come back to the leaf for more leader.",
    "Yeah, OK, so we've got that I've got the leaf.",
    "For now.",
    "And the good thing about this is now we can have her hair tucked nicely behind there and I think it's going to look a lot better now, it gives me some idea what I'm doing with the hair, so for example, let's go back to the brush.",
    "I was using now we can have.",
    "You know this kind of.",
    "Affect that it's a little bit of like a pin.",
    "A hairpin or something.",
    "Wet brush it used for the shiny things I used the rectangle texture brush at a very small size, so I was just basically making little square.",
    "Those square dots with it.",
    "You guys can find my brushes below the stream in the description panel or above the chat in the info tab.",
    "There should be links to my brushes in both places.",
    "The brush I was just using their is just part of my basic.",
    "Brush pack that's free to download if you want to check it out.",
    "Alright I will leave the leaf on its own layer.",
    "Still, because I might want to do some shading under it, or move it around so I'm not ready to we're not ready to commit to the leaf yet but.",
    "Let's keep going and keep painting her face so it's time to put some.",
    "For some sharp details here so we're going to, I'm using the wet paint brush.",
    "It looks like this.",
    "It's a cool brush, but it took me awhile to get used to working with it because you kind of if you paint like this, or like this do you see how the darker side of the brush will be at the Top or bottom so it's really nice for doing a little bit of shading like for example, if I want.",
    "The underneath of the main part of the brush to have like a little bit of a shadow.",
    "It kind of automatically does that, but you have to make the brush stroke in a certain direction.",
    "Otherwise, it's going to be opposite.",
    "So, sometimes I have a little.",
    "The controls the a couple times, so I figure out what I'm doing but I like this brush a lot.",
    "For that effect, I think it's really nice.",
    "And it looks very to me, it looks.",
    "Like.",
    "Real paint paint strokes.",
    "The leaf looks magical thanks I'm glad you like it.",
    "I I like to generally stay pretty soft with eyebrows and things but we'll see.",
    "Let's see.",
    "Give a little bit more.",
    "Crisp detail to the eyelid.",
    "And the lower one and sometimes I will also.",
    "Paint in like a little bit of pink in the eyelid like a color pic from her lips.",
    "'cause there's going to be subtle amount and let's go darker.",
    "See the corner of the eye where you have, like tear duct.",
    "Sometimes you'll see a little bit of pink there so sometimes I paint that in it kind of depends.",
    "Have you painted your pic Oh like a self portrait?",
    "Um not anytime recently I mean, I've done some self portraits like in my life.",
    "But it's been a long time.",
    "So I don't have any.",
    "Any recent ones to show you.",
    "So this is such a dark line that I'm painting on Top.",
    "It's like really changing her face.",
    "You can lower the opacity a little bit if it's too much and you don't want to cover up so much what you've done before.",
    "So I'm using color that's not quite pure black, but it's pretty desaturated.",
    "But for the lips, I might want to choose something a little bit more like a dark warm red because even in the shadows.",
    "We still often have a little bit of saturation to the color.",
    "I do have fun painting portraits.",
    "Once I get into it.",
    "I find the early stages kind of rough, you know.",
    "I want to get into it.",
    "It's fun fun to get in here and paint little details and things.",
    "So her eyes are Brown my version of her eyes are very Gray, so far.",
    "I'd like to give them a bit more warmth in.",
    "Saturation like depth, so it's coming here with some deeper Brown.",
    "And.",
    "Darker up.",
    "And the Top under the eyelid.",
    "Again, I'm painting a little bit more in like a semi realistic kind of.",
    "Style I'm not trying to go for a very, very realistic painting style.",
    "It's a bit of- from that proportions wise, but I just kind of enjoy enjoy painting this style.",
    "It's kind of like a little bit of an idealized realism innocence.",
    "That a lot of times semi realistic style will have.",
    "Some details left out just kind of smooth things over a bit.",
    "So we don't get super super into each skin pore or like tiny little hairs and stuff like that.",
    "I will include some, but it kind of just depends on.",
    "What I think is adding to the picture and what I think looks nice.",
    "And if I think it's distracting or it takes away something that I won't do it.",
    "Let me give a little bit more.",
    "Turn to the corner of her mouth.",
    "Can I share my tree painting process?",
    "Of course I would love to see it?",
    "So you can post it in the chat.",
    "So I want to actually paint her teeth.",
    "Always, a scary idea every time came from pizza can end up looking very creepy.",
    "But we're not going to get Super Crisp or super detailed with it.",
    "I'm just going to paint.",
    "I colored pick from her eyes to get a little bit of that kind of off white color.",
    "It's actually pretty dark.",
    "Look how dark the color is this is what I'm painting her teeth right now, but it's just all relative colors.",
    "All relative so compared to the colors around it.",
    "It kind of looks white or like a possible color of teeth.",
    "Let's see your scared why let me see.",
    "Oh my gosh, what are you scared of?",
    "What are you scared of this is under his painting?",
    "That she's working on and there is nothing to be scared of look at these beautiful details and the colours.",
    "You chose for the more cool like blue greens in the shadows and then the warmer yellow greens and the sun.",
    "It looks really good, he putting a lot of time in detail into this.",
    "Yeah, nothing to be scared about.",
    "Yeah, look at that look at that I really like the depth that you kept these silhouettes.",
    "Like edit distance so you can really feel like these plants are kind of closer to the viewer.",
    "Yeah, it's looking really good don't you worry thing.",
    "It's looking really good.",
    "I'm very happy with it anyway.",
    "Can add a little bit more saturation to the lips?",
    "And I might change her.",
    "What's the word expression alittle bit.",
    "I don't know.",
    "I like to draw people that are smiling have a little happy smile or smirk.",
    "I mean, you can always draw the kind of.",
    "You know serious model pose and expression and everything.",
    "But I don't know.",
    "I just think it's a little bit more uplifting to look at.",
    "Like to draw a little smile.",
    "I should really practice.",
    "Some other types of expressions.",
    "Maybe that something will study together someday guys.",
    "Different facial expressions like more extreme ones.",
    "I think that would be something good to do.",
    "I'm just noticing now that I should actually if I want her to look at us and not that she's looking far to the side.",
    "I need to move her.",
    "I a little bit from where I placed it.",
    "You actually can see if you look at the reference.",
    "It's possible to see a little bit of the white of her eyes.",
    "On the Corner in the corner.",
    "Face expressions I run.",
    "Oh my gosh.",
    "I know it's it's not really it's not really my.",
    "My comfort either I have, like a few types of expressions that I generally like to paint and that's mostly because the type of paintings.",
    "I like to do are generally.",
    "Just being just being honest, I like to paint fantasy scenes.",
    "I like to paint if I do paint characters.",
    "I kind of like to paint.",
    "Like a peaceful scenes like elves or fairies or something magical and just relaxing kind of scenes and I don't usually paint a lot of dramatic expressions or Super.",
    "Yeah, I I go with fairly peaceful happy kinds of environment in my paintings, so most of the time I don't really need to.",
    "Paint crazy expressions, however, I feel like it's also just a good thing to have make your skills a little bit more well rounded.",
    "So.",
    "Anyway, OK, I had to move her.",
    "I ended up repainting a lot of it, but it's OK, I could have.",
    "Notice that earlier, but now she's looking at us.",
    "Poker face is my favorite.",
    "Yeah, well OK, I will just be honest.",
    "I think it's really important when you're 1st starting painting portraits to stick with basic facial expressions.",
    "Maybe some people would disagree with me, but I feel like it's good to work first at just trying to get the proportions right and put the right.",
    "The anatomy in the right place and not try to do any crazy expressions right off the bat so for me.",
    "I was still for awhile.",
    "I was just kind of like working on my basic basic anatomy.",
    "I think maybe it can be.",
    "Now that could be something to do soon some different expressions.",
    "But I don't think that's something that you need to run into if you're 1st starting to paint people.",
    "I think maybe it's good to hold off on the crazy expressions of 1st.",
    "So I'm going to, I painted the eye on a separate layer and I'm going to erase out a little bit of what I did on the eyelids around the eye and leave just what I modified in the center with the move of the people in iris because I kind of liked my original eyelid painting, but I want I still want to move by over so.",
    "OK.",
    "Let's let's continue.",
    "Sorry.",
    "We repainted the whole I OK, so let's let's start with some finishing things on the ice machine touches.",
    "So just go to the iris over here get that.",
    "In the right spots and.",
    "We can add some.",
    "The leaf is going to.",
    "The leaf is taking the painting through another level, yeah, we have to match the leaf now.",
    "I'm just kidding.",
    "We don't have to make everything quite that detailed.",
    "Once once we decide on.",
    "Finishing details for the face.",
    "Go and paint the face and the leaf, a little bit more to match each other better.",
    "But I was planning on doing more details of the face.",
    "Anyway.",
    "But it's surprising how much a little bit of shining texture can make a big difference, so for example, when we add that the lights to the eyes.",
    "That's going to make a big, big change before we get to that.",
    "I want to add a little bit more saturation.",
    "There's some shadows that I have around her eye on this side for example, and it just looks really almost like I don't know almost dirty.",
    "I don't like it when.",
    "Shadows look like that I feel like that.",
    "Probably I've done something wrong value.",
    "Wise, like the shading darks to lights and I can try to add a little bit of saturation, but that's only going to fix so much.",
    "Let's make a new layer and figure out what I've done.",
    "That makes this look dirty over here.",
    "Zoom out zoom out.",
    "Oh my gosh.",
    "Gotta zoom out, I'm.",
    "Going to make some bad choices if we don't look at this from more of a distance.",
    "Better.",
    "We can have a little bit more shadow coming from the.",
    "Hi Bro, Down here 'cause we got a little bit of an angle view.",
    "And she has some little shine on the eyelid here.",
    "Make up.",
    "I think it's better.",
    "OK finally let's add.",
    "Some highlights so I'm going to start with the Airbrush and just choose.",
    "Hey white closer to white color and maybe a little bit cooler.",
    "For the the I were going to get a little bit more roundness to the eyeball by putting.",
    "Brighter area.",
    "Closer to the The iris.",
    "Is it possible to see the values after you finish working on yes?",
    "Also, they will change a little bit more as I'm about to put like some final highlights and shiny things.",
    "But if we turn the painting into black-and-white this is what it looks like.",
    "And I can also see the.",
    "With the reference looks like here.",
    "So there's quite a big difference.",
    "But I think value wise the difference isn't too bad.",
    "I can definitely be brighter in the face and we're lacking some like noise detail.",
    "But.",
    "To study and do you feel like?",
    "I'm learning something.",
    "Not really.",
    "Well, that's nice to hear Andre I think that's a good sign.",
    "I think that's a good sign.",
    "I don't need to make a new layer every time I'm being making too many layers OK.",
    "Let's paint.",
    "The shines in the eyes.",
    "Finally we waited so long for this moment.",
    "Alright Here we go?",
    "I'm using the brush in my brush pack called wet paint.",
    "I like this one for making these little shines.",
    "There's I'm just going from the reference.",
    "There's the shines in the eyes are broken up into a bunch of little dots, sometimes you get like one big dot.",
    "There's also little shining down here.",
    "This makes the eyes look really glacis.",
    "So it's up to you like how many you want to put in.",
    "How intense you want to go with that?",
    "I'm also going to add some eyelashes now.",
    "I try to stay away from adding a ton of individual eyelashes.",
    "A good tip, I learned is try to paint the eyelashes as if they're wet like if you ever seen someone get out of a pool or shower or your own eyelashes for example.",
    "How they'll stick together and kind of clump up like this?",
    "That's a good way to paint eyelashes.",
    "Sometimes it looks a little bit more.",
    "A natural when you kind of like space them evenly and or or have a whole lot of them it feels.",
    "Feels.",
    "A little bit better to kind of clump them together, most of the time from a distance.",
    "Also, you're only going to really see it kind of like that, you're not going to see so many individual eyelashes.",
    "From a distance so.",
    "Something think about trying to give him a nice curve.",
    "And the bottom eyelashes can show a lot about the angle.",
    "The angle that they're coming out of the eye.",
    "This will not die.",
    "But you know the eyelid, yeah, so it'll give a lot of information about the direction so it can really help make the eyelid look more rounded if you turn the eyelashes.",
    "As you go around see what I mean, like turning the direction of them.",
    "I usually like to only put the eyelashes kind of around the edge.",
    "But.",
    "Oops.",
    "OK.",
    "So.",
    "Think about this.",
    "I'm going to keep going with some more details, finishing up the face so for example, the corners of the mouth.",
    "Anywhere that we just want a little bit more detail and sharpness.",
    "We can just kind of go over with a hard edge brush and.",
    "Paint that in.",
    "I don't think I will paint like a space between the teeth or anything like that.",
    "I think it works well enough to just show the color of the teeth back there, if you start painting, too many individual teeth that kind of can look creepy but.",
    "Haley art welcome good morning.",
    "How are you?",
    "I think I will add a little bit of detail to the eyebrows.",
    "Just a little bit one thing that's fun is you can color pic from the skin.",
    "An kind of pull that color in towards the eyebrow versus just you know the opposite and bringing eyebrows outside of the eyebrow shape.",
    "You can also sort of cut in like that to put a little bit of space.",
    "It's all very in fashion now to have a little bit of bigger eyebrows and more natural eyebrows.",
    "It seems so we can give her.",
    "Some.",
    "Some more detail there.",
    "Hey Karen, how are you welcome?",
    "I'm glad you could make it.",
    "We're doing some sort of polishing effects on.",
    "Portrait here.",
    "Ah Tanager birds.",
    "I'm honored.",
    "Thank you for coming over here to catch the stream.",
    "I hope you're doing well today.",
    "Let me zoom out.",
    "Let me zoom out.",
    "Here's our painting, so far.",
    "You can see the reference here it doesn't look exactly like her, but",
    "My goal was just to do a good job with the portrait just to make a nice portrait.",
    "Semi realistic.",
    "Sort of style and.",
    "And to practice on the.",
    "Folds fabric folds, and things now the sweater that I've painted it doesn't necessarily look like the exact same type of fabric as what she's wearing in the reference but.",
    "Up.",
    "As long as the folds are good then I'll be happy.",
    "We're going to do a little bit more on this and I'm just looking at her face.",
    "I think I need to.",
    "Do something with this guy over here.",
    "I'm going to copy it onto a new layer and maybe I need to move it over or make it bigger or both.",
    "I don't know.",
    "Seems like her eyes like I painted her eyes like farther apart in my painting than they are in real life.",
    "And that's bothering.",
    "I think it's a little bit better.",
    "Yeah, so I'm just modifying some of the facial features.",
    "I painted too, hopefully being a better proportion.",
    "The bit maybe a bit late for that, but let's just keep going well will zoom out for awhile and paint.",
    "From here, so I'd like to get more of a consistent feeling of on the whole painting.",
    "I feel I don't know if you guys know what I'm talking about, but when I zoom in for awhile.",
    "And then I zoom out sometimes I feel like I just don't have a consistent painting throughout the whole scene.",
    "Sometimes it's like I just want to want to work around and get the same detail level everywhere and the the area.",
    "I was just working on when I was zoomed in looks good.",
    "But we need to work on some other areas and get things just working happily together again.",
    "Ah, thank you.",
    "Thanks Karen it's going good.",
    "It's going good.",
    "It's been good painting day so far.",
    "No complaints.",
    "What program do you use to keep the reference photo always visible it is called pure ref?",
    "I'm going to type it in the chat just in case that helps because you might want to look I might want to Google, it.",
    "But it's pure raff it's Super Handy.",
    "You can.",
    "Use it for reference boards and mood boards and things but mostly what I use it.",
    "For is just what you see here holding the reference up there, especially when I'm when I'm streaming.",
    "I'm going to make a new layer and put it on multiply mode.",
    "I'm going to clip that on to my layer of the person and that way I can do some shading an?",
    "I don't like that color.",
    "But I think it does need to be darker.",
    "We paint more after this, I'm going to work on this painting for a little while longer.",
    "But I'm probably not going to start a new painting today.",
    "I just want to be able to Polish this one a little bit more.",
    "That's true from general to particular otherwise you lose the focus.",
    "Yeah, I feel like that's what happened a little bit here so.",
    "Let's zoom out an let's paint from this distance also I'm going to try to flip this OK, there, we go.",
    "Going to do some painting from this distance.",
    "So I just want to put a little bit of shadow underneath her hair and underneath her arm and just.",
    "Just in a couple of places.",
    "That I think could use a little bit more depth.",
    "I don't want to go too far with this so I have it on a separate layer.",
    "An I can turn the layer on and off or lower the Opacity.",
    "So I think that's what I'll do is just lower it to about 36% or something.",
    "OK, so now we can go back into painting so I'm going to grab a harder edged brush and just continue on with what we were doing way back when we were painting the?",
    "The sweater so I'm just going to go back to that hand painting, some of the textures and even though it feels.",
    "Um.",
    "A little bit difficult to be so zoomed out and an painting something detail like this.",
    "I think it's important to stay zoomed out while I paint the sweater details, especially near the edges of the canvas.",
    "We don't want to get too.",
    "Crisp here so I'm just going to paint it from this.",
    "Distance.",
    "How much longer is the stream I'm not surely art to be honest?",
    "I am having a hard time estimating?",
    "How long this is going to take.",
    "I don't do a lot of.",
    "This paper.",
    "Portraits exactly so I'm not 100% sure, but I would suspect.",
    "Another.",
    "Half an hour to hour maybe.",
    "Probably half an hour is a bit of a short estimate based on what I have to do next, but it will depend how smoothly things go it.",
    "I'm just going to keep painting and take my time and I don't have an exact plan, but it seems like it's almost done.",
    "But I also know myself and we might run up to we might come up with some other.",
    "Things we want to do and take a lot longer.",
    "So.",
    "I don't I don't know some days when we do landscapes for example, I have alot.",
    "Better of an idea.",
    "Ahead of time.",
    "Hey, how are you keep going OK we're going to keep going for a bit longer anyway.",
    "OK, so we have some horizontal stripes on the right side or horizontal stripes on the left vertical stripes on the right the pattern on her sweater.",
    "So I'm just following that.",
    "The sweater looks shiny, I know it really does it reminds me of like?",
    "I don't know something, you to wear on like.",
    "And New Years or something I mean, if you were going to, if you were going to wear sweater like this, you don't want to get a nice shiny one like this.",
    "Because of these little marks they look kind of like sequins, but",
    "It was sort of a happy accident.",
    "It just kind of started turning out this way, and I liked it so I figured why not?",
    "There's no rules it has to be.",
    "Affori looking sweater.",
    "Can be shining one?",
    "As long as the folds look good.",
    "That's why you're thinking of yeah that's what it reminds me too.",
    "I don't know that it necessarily makes sense for her to be wearing this like in the forest but.",
    "It's fine and it matches her imagines her leaf.",
    "Although I wonder what it would look like if we made her leaflike closer in color like a little bit less.",
    "You know made it more of like this page color.",
    "I don't know.",
    "Can be saturated a little bit less?",
    "Maybe that's more natural.",
    "I don't know in the reference is very pretty how the leaf.",
    "Looks.",
    "Happy accidents are the best, yeah, sometimes it's fun to just go with it.",
    "That's how you discover some really awesome.",
    "Things sometimes, and your painting trying stuff and then.",
    "Suddenly, something happens, and you're like well, I didn't plan that but I like it.",
    "She can wear whatever she wants in the forest.",
    "That's true.",
    "I like to paint a lot of like elf type characters and things like that.",
    "And certainly we can wear whatever they want a lot of times.",
    "I like to think about giving them You know sort of more organic looking type of clothing, but it's really all fantasy anyway.",
    "There's no there's no rules.",
    "I wonder what would look like if he painted a whole if you made a whole painting kind of in that style.",
    "Of the way that I'm painting the sweater.",
    "I wonder could maybe get a little bit more of an impressionism type of look.",
    "The painting.",
    "Lots of tiny brush strokes.",
    "It's a little bit time, consuming, but Also relaxing if you don't mind just kind of getting into zone.",
    "How did you learn to draw versa?",
    "Is kind of a combination of things I?",
    "I started drawing as a kid and I.",
    "I just always kept drawing from Ben to now, but in between there was a lot of things that happened, I.",
    "I went to school for art at Florida State in Tallahassee.",
    "It's not an art school.",
    "But I did I studied art in studio art studio or an art history, there, so I did get a little bit of a traditional background an my focus was drawing.",
    "And I didn't do any painting or any digital painting while I was in school.",
    "It was all like drawing and art art history, focus so Post College.",
    "I ended up doing a lot of learning on line to kind of further my art education and that's when I got into digital and I followed a lot of tutorials on Patris on like artists.",
    "I was following on Patris on Gumroad YouTube.",
    "All that kind of stuff is.",
    "So I learned I learned a lot from there and.",
    "That's when I kind of got into digital so I have a little bit of like combination background of studying are in school, but also studying a lot from Internet.",
    "But I I used to mow it first got me into drawing was watching shows like Sailor Moon.",
    "And things like that when I was a kid and wanting to draw the characters from that.",
    "That's what first got me into it and that's how I.",
    "Kind of got more passionate about what making wanting to make my drawings look nice when I was in middle school and high school.",
    "Drawing from photos and things like that.",
    "So.",
    "All that time was kind of just.",
    "Just winging it, I didn't really have any.",
    "Particular.",
    "Education at that point until until I got to school.",
    "How did you go from Florida to the Netherlands?",
    "Yeah, OK so I actually met my boyfriend on line through Twitch actually?",
    "So you never know what's going to happen in life so that was that was unexpected, but anyway, yes, so I met my boyfriend on line and we were in a long distance relationship.",
    "After that, and then I decided to move to the Netherlands.",
    "And it's been a really good experience so far.",
    "I've been here about a year and a half.",
    "Really happy here, I've gotten to see a lot of new things and it's giving me a lot of inspiration in my art, especially with the landscape painting so.",
    "Yeah, that's that's how that happened.",
    "Oh my gosh, yes, Emily my sister sent about to me, she sent it to me on Instagram apparently there's a?",
    "And a Sailor Moon makeup palette out now in case anybody needed to know about that.",
    "Breaking news.",
    "It looks very cute.",
    "Yeah, I did see that.",
    "I was looking at the colors and I was like I don't really.",
    "I was like I really want this.",
    "But I don't think I'm going to wear these colors, they are pretty bright so.",
    "Yeah, but it's cool.",
    "Hi projects, The paintings looking great thank you.",
    "Very cool.",
    "I'm at my fancy online as well.",
    "Move from Cali to ansi we've been together 9 years, Oh that's amazing that's really cool.",
    "Well, I'm happy for you guys.",
    "I feel like I'm a meeting people more and more that have had that experience nowadays.",
    "Thanks for sharing watching this inspired me to get an ipad and start drawing.",
    "I can't wait to keep learning that's amazing.",
    "I'm so happy to hear that.",
    "That's super exciting well if there's anyway.",
    "Yeah, once you get your iPad.",
    "If there's anyway, I can help let me know I've only recently gotten an iPad.",
    "I got one for Christmas actually and it's pretty exciting, but I'm not like a pro with it yet.",
    "I want to learn more.",
    "Mostly, I paint on my PC with on my centriq in photo shop.",
    "But I've been messing around a little on the iPad.",
    "But anyway, if there's any just general digital painting or art related questions.",
    "I can help with you can always send me a message.",
    "Actually, Fancy Fancy Sailor Mars.",
    "Yeah, my sister her favorite with sailor Venus and wine was sailor, Jupiter when I first started watching the show.",
    "And then eventually I became a huge sailor, Saturn fan.",
    "I even dressed up as her for Halloween, it was.",
    "It was my it was probably like.",
    "My coolest that was the coolest diver was when I was sailor, Saturn for Halloween, one year.",
    "Let's see same also I was like have 2 pallets.",
    "I barely use.",
    "I'm just going to stare at the pictures, yeah exactly.",
    "Unless you guys are going to start seeing me where some crazy makeup on stream and then you'll know that I just caved and bought the Sailor Moon palette.",
    "Just like bright pink eye shadow.",
    "Were almost were almost there.",
    "With this sweater?",
    "On the topic of learning and getting into digital art.",
    "Can share a link I don't?",
    "No how much here will be applicable.",
    "Uhm it kind of depends on the person.",
    "Hopefully, you'll find something you like here, but If there's a little bit of traditional a little bit of digital alot, there's there's a lot of tutorials and things there on that page that have helped me over the last 6 years or so that I've been doing digital art and.",
    "They are there are some YouTube channels and just various things that I found helpful so I hope you guys will find something useful there.",
    "Everyone has different learning styles so.",
    "They're kind of just feel free to skip through until you find something that you like but there's a long list.",
    "So hopefully there's something it's got some of my favourites.",
    "Brush Paxson.",
    "All kinds of things.",
    "And I like to add to that list.",
    "Still, now because I'm always.",
    "I still like I like to watch tons of tutorials and process videos and streams and things also.",
    "Really, Oh that's cool that's cool.",
    "I didn't hear about that.",
    "Yeah, their books are really nice.",
    "Alright I'm going to add a little bit more.",
    "Highlights here.",
    "I can't leave this one area just kind of untouched because the Airbrush is super smooth and it it's very.",
    "Obvious think.",
    "Leave an area totally smooth.",
    "OK, so one thing that I want to do now is.",
    "I've worked on her for a while we worked on the background before and now I kind of want to look at getting her in the background.",
    "More cohesive.",
    "So.",
    "For example, What I mean by that is a little combination of things it has to do with color has to do with value like I still feel like she just looks like she's standing in front of this background and there's a reason.",
    "Part of it has to do with the lack of detail the background is still looking much more blurry we can add more detail there.",
    "And another thing has to do with color so will address the colors 1st.",
    "Hi a sling more welcome.",
    "Welcome welcome.",
    "We're working on a portrait.",
    "So what I would like to do now is to make a new layer an adjustment layer so I have my layers palette here.",
    "I'm going to go down to this half circle icon and select.",
    "Let's let's use color balance and.",
    "I will create a clipping mask of the color balance balance layer onto the character so that it's only affecting her so any changes.",
    "They make are not going to have anything to do with the background.",
    "And then I'm going to go through The Shadows Midtones and highlights and just kind of.",
    "Shift the Shift these a little bit.",
    "Until I feel like she.",
    "Belongs in the scene, a little bit more so my prediction was that I was going to want to shift her a little bit Hue shift her a little bit more towards a green because I feel like the background has a lot of Green.",
    "There's a lot of green maybe a lot of green bounce light so that actually feels better already.",
    "Let's see the before and after.",
    "Before after.",
    "OK, it's like barely noticeable.",
    "Maybe it's in my head let's look at the mid tones.",
    "And highlights.",
    "Going to go a little bit more like cyan.",
    "Yeah.",
    "It's a little bit different may have been not much of a change.",
    "We can also look at the levels.",
    "So I think we need to add more contrast darken.",
    "The shadows little bit again.",
    "I want this to be clipped on here, so that it's not changing the background.",
    "See that it's a big difference.",
    "She was looking kind of washed out compared to the background.",
    "And if anything, we want the obvious that the opposite would want the background to be like later in less contrast, and her so that she stands out so.",
    "Yeah, she is a little bit more.",
    "Little bit more contrast now.",
    "So for and after.",
    "Looking a little dark.",
    "2.",
    "OK, I think I like this.",
    "I think I like this change.",
    "So I'm going to go with it.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Now, technically didn't have to use adjustment layers for those since I was just going to merge them all but I wanted to be able to turn the visibility on and off and check everything together before committing to it so.",
    "OK.",
    "Also I'm going to look at the little hair ornament and I think I will desaturate it a little bit.",
    "It's just really, really drawing my attention with how yellow it was so we're going to turn that down a little bit.",
    "And I'm going to merge it down onto her face.",
    "Actually, the immediate regret before I merge it hold on.",
    "Let's zoom in this event, There's one thing I should do OK.",
    "Before we merge it down this will be very quick.",
    "I just going to take the Airbrush and give a little bit of shading underneath 'cause like that's going to make it really look like it's sitting against her skin.",
    "Without that, it looks like it's kind of floating there, so there, we go now we can merge it down.",
    "So one extra step.",
    "OK, so let's save.",
    "Write another like checkpoint, OK, so right now.",
    "If I was going to merge her with the background.",
    "This would be the time when I would consider doing it, but I don't know that I want to do that.",
    "I don't know that it's needed, for her to be merged to the background.",
    "But I'm going to make a new layer an start painting the.",
    "Some more of the leaves.",
    "Let me show you guys, the reference up close.",
    "So there are you can see this blur effect on the right 'cause.",
    "This wall is further away from us, but on the left.",
    "These leaves are like pretty in focus.",
    "They're closer to her face on the Camera you know focused in there so.",
    "One thing that we could do is.",
    "Drossart paint some of those leaves a little bit more precisely also I think I can crop in like her compared to the background.",
    "I have like way more background going on in my image.",
    "I think than the original and I certainly don't feel the need to paint that much more background so let's.",
    "Let's zoom in a little bit.",
    "And these catch up the little shadow, thank you.",
    "Yeah, it makes it's nice because it does make a difference.",
    "And if I try to do it later it would be a bit.",
    "Well, it would be a lot more work as I'd have to go all carefully around the leaf so.",
    "Yeah, I'm glad I realized it before I had to go back in.",
    "Paint it later.",
    "OK, yeah, that crop is way better.",
    "I didn't realize how much that extra background was distracting me OK.",
    "Here we go.",
    "So now we can take I mean, I I'm not sure how much if it really matters.",
    "What brush we're using here, but a brush with hard edge and.",
    "We can start painting some individual leave shapes.",
    "Hi corban, beautiful work I'd like to know what is the shortcut to flip the image.",
    "Thank you first of all and let me show you where that is I messed up explaining this earlier so let me.",
    "And they were properly now you go to edit.",
    "Keyboard shortcuts.",
    "And then application menus.",
    "And then you can go to image.",
    "Philip canvas horizontal and you need to type in here, something that you would like to be your shortcut because it will not.",
    "It's not a default shortcut.",
    "So you have to go through those steps to set it up, but it's not it's not too difficult to just go to edit keyboard shortcuts and then shortcuts for application menus.",
    "And then scroll all the way down to image and then go flip canvas horizontal control F.",
    "And then we should be good to go.",
    "I put control F because it's easy to remember like F for flip but you can put anything of course.",
    "I am drawing and painting on a have a welcome centriq 22.",
    "So I'm using the stylus painting on the screen, and then my left hand.",
    "I'm using all the keyboard shortcuts, so I find it easier to pick.",
    "Shortcuts that are I can hit with the left hand on the left side of the keyboard.",
    "Otherwise, you know it's just very inconvenient.",
    "Yeah, you're welcome, no worries.",
    "I use that one all the time of course, you can just go to also go to edit or image, adjust flip horizontal wait am I telling the wrong thing image image rotation flip horizontal, yeah, so this one.",
    "You can do you can always just go to the menus like this and if you only flip every once in awhile then?",
    "That's fine, but If you want to do it, I'll do a lot of flipping then.",
    "You can set it as a shortcut.",
    "So I'm just going to these very, very kind of messy and vague believe shapes that I have an starting to hopefully make them look more like individual leaves so I'm just putting some hard edges in and maybe we can even draw in some little.",
    "Veins in the leaves something like this.",
    "So they're kind of like coming out of abstraction a little bit.",
    "And you can paint via like regular painting like just paint.",
    "The leaf or you can sort of do some negative space painting where you choose.",
    "The background color and use that to paint.",
    "In around green shapes and define the Leafs more see that also can work with different ways of doing this.",
    "Pending on what works for you.",
    "Or a little bit of both.",
    "I think a little bit of both is a natural more of a natural look.",
    "I think it's a little bit tricky to find that perfect.",
    "Like fade from.",
    "From in focus to the blur effect that we use for the background.",
    "So I think sometimes you have to go ahead and pay over that a bit.",
    "So you get a little bit more subtle transition.",
    "We use like a Gaussian blur at the beginning.",
    "To make the background a little bit more.",
    "Blurred out.",
    "So I'm painting on a layer above her right now, so I'm actually able to paint over the edge of I can paint over her and stuff.",
    "I don't know if I want to do that.",
    "It's possible.",
    "Well, I hope you guys are having a good day.",
    "Thank you for hanging out with me.",
    "We're not quite done, but we're getting closer.",
    "If you guys have any questions or anything, let me know.",
    "Definitely want to get a chance to put some more finishing touches on this at the end and so I would consider finishing touches to be like any little areas that have little shine or little rim light or something.",
    "There's not too much of that, like rim late.",
    "There's not too much of that kind of lighting, but I might like to do some little flyaway hairs just last little things like that.",
    "Also, a nice thing to keep note of is.",
    "Around the edges of the canvas, especially you know the corners lower areas anything away from the focal point.",
    "It's sometimes it's nice to get rid of any like super distracting things there so if there's any really break if we painted anything really bright.",
    "Or.",
    "Very eye catching.",
    "It might be nice to tone that down a little bit.",
    "If anybody is just getting here now or recently if you'd like to see this painting from the beginning.",
    "We started it from blank canvas at the beginning of stream so you're welcome to check out the replay of this, if you ever want to.",
    "It's if you go to my page here on be hands.",
    "There's a tab that says videos and any of the past streams are there so you could watch any of them if you're interested in this one will be there after a little bit of processing.",
    "Time post stream and then you'll be able to find it later.",
    "All right, so if I turn this layer on a Nov.",
    "I'm definitely liking.",
    "This a lot better with the extra background.",
    "Details it stoning the background down a bit.",
    "It's darkening it a bit an I feel like it has more dimension.",
    "I like these leaves closer to her face being more detail than I want to add more of those.",
    "Hi Eric all thank you.",
    "I'm glad you like it.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Thank you, you guys can find the reference image of your curious to see it in the stream description below or on the info tab on Top of the chat.",
    "And Yeah, it's from.",
    "I believe unsplash.",
    "Yeah, it's from a photographer on unsplash that I linked to there.",
    "Post of the photos and the description if you want to find them, but it's unsplash is a free to use.",
    "Image archive, so I like to look there for references also pixels is a good one.",
    "After finding nice images to do studies of and things like that.",
    "You guys are always welcome to join in if you want to paint with me.",
    "You're welcome to share what you do.",
    "We had a very cool, one earlier from Jackson.",
    "We do another painting, I don't know how long you've been live already today.",
    "Unfortunately, I won't be doing another painting, I've been streaming for about 3, 1/2 hours and I will be working on this one.",
    "A little bit more.",
    "But I probably won't be starting a new painting.",
    "Today.",
    "But sometimes we do, sometimes we do more than one painting in a stream in that case.",
    "I generally will kind of budget out a little bit less time for each one.",
    "So I'm trying to paint around her head a little bit of lighter colors for the leaves when we started this there was a lot of the black shadow around their head.",
    "Yeah, this is an art club study.",
    "Every 2 weeks my discord community is doing a sort of group study were studying different subjects.",
    "This time around, we were working on.",
    "Up.",
    "Fabric folds and wrinkles and things like that, although let's be honest.",
    "I spent a lot of time working on other things in the painting, too, but.",
    "The main reason we chose this image was for the fabric texture.",
    "Things.",
    "But anybody is welcome to join in with that, if you're interested I can put a link to my discord.",
    "In the chat and anybody who's watching the replay for this, if you'd like to find a link to my discord you can go to the.",
    "You can go to my profile and there's a link in there.",
    "My information area.",
    "Buy a pro designer thanks for hanging out with us.",
    "Have a good day.",
    "Alright I want to zoom in and do a little bit more of these.",
    "These leaves closer to her and maybe we can even detail one of the Brown ones more.",
    "I mean, just because they're kind of dry doesn't mean they don't have any detail.",
    "We can give a little detail.",
    "Seems like the adding a little bit of the veins in the leave goes along way.",
    "A little bit of like glimmer.",
    "You can even sketch some of that in up here.",
    "In these.",
    "I think that's an OK transition.",
    "OK, yeah, I think I like that, so were to make a new layer on Top of this and I'm just going to work on edges between her and the background.",
    "So.",
    "An final little finishing things so this is something Mills asked about earlier.",
    "Um was about these little kind of flyaway fuzzy things in the sweater.",
    "There's like these little tiny fuzzy's and the.",
    "The sweater texture that I ended up going with is a bit different.",
    "So I don't know if the fuzzies really make sense for me to add but I've certainly seen fuzzy sweaters with sequins on at the same time, so I think it is possible so I can try it, I can try adding the fuzzy texture to the edges and see if it if it works, or if it feels weird then.",
    "We'll take it of.- But it's basically just these little tiny, squiggly hairs that are catching some light and it's really apparent more in the high contrast areas like where the sweaters overlapping the background.",
    "Then you'll see you'll probably see it.",
    "What do you guys think about it just like a first impression?",
    "I'm going to keep going a little bit more 'cause sometimes.",
    "It's hard to make a judgment on a small area.",
    "I think I like it, but I'm not sure.",
    "You guys can let me know if you have a strong opinion on this sweater fuzzies.",
    "I'm doing it on a separate layer so we can always bail.",
    "Can you illustrate an image that does not belong to you and is not hosted on a free site like unsplash?",
    "Well, it's a bit of a complicated issue and I feel like I don't feel really authorized to answer without being a lawyer because it's a bit complicated.",
    "Technically, you just have to be really careful doing that people have different art styles and sometimes someone references an image but there painting becomes so different from the original that you sometimes can't even tell what they were originally basing it off of and in that case.",
    "Then it's less of a problem, but if you're going to recreate something and paint.",
    "It very realistically very, very much like the original than that can be.",
    "Yeah, that could be potentially a problem.",
    "If you're going to try to sell something with your sort of copy.",
    "You know what I mean, if you're just doing it for like practice and stuff like that, then that's generally not an issue.",
    "It's nice to give credit to the original person that you were the photographer what not but.",
    "It's more of an issue when you're selling things.",
    "It does fit OK, so you're OK with the fuzzies I kinda like them.",
    "I kinda like them.",
    "I'm going to keep doing it.",
    "But I like to use Pexels Unsplash Pixabay.",
    "There are just so many good royalty, free image sites out there.",
    "Nowadays, I mean, it's it's.",
    "You don't really need to.",
    "Go into a risky area you know.",
    "Because there's so much out there.",
    "There's really, really a lot of content you can use that's safe so.",
    "I would I would try to stick with that, if you can just have a?",
    "Less headache.",
    "Oh, thank you.",
    "Karen thank you.",
    "Thank you, yeah, tanager.",
    "Exactly exactly it just gets a little more complicated.",
    "Love the texture yay OK.",
    "Thank you I'm glad.",
    "Also wondering if it was a little too much.",
    "Glad you like it.",
    "So I'm not going to put the texture everywhere.",
    "But just more in the focal areas and let's work, a little bit more on the hair.",
    "I will probably leave the hair fairly smooth just because I think.",
    "I think it looks nice.",
    "I'm pretty happy with how the hair looks anyway.",
    "But we can add a little bit more highlights or just a little bit more.",
    "You know, some little more individual strands.",
    "Sometimes it's nice to like purposely add Little Flyaways and things that kind of go away from the overall.",
    "Motion of the hair might seem counter intuitive but it can make the hair look.",
    "A lot more natural if you have some random little flyaways and things rather than all the hairs perfectly going in the same direction because as much as we would like that to be the case.",
    "It's usually not happening that way usually there's random hairs flying around.",
    "So.",
    "I like this area of the hair how kind of curls under.",
    "It's got a little bit less one color.",
    "Kind of curls and tucks under itself a little bit there.",
    "You can also use a darker strands.",
    "The background here is a little bit lighter, so we can take some of the darker strands and bring that front of the background.",
    "And.",
    "Perfect down here, the background little darker, so we can bring some of this lighter strands in front.",
    "The darker background.",
    "And that's how you can get some more like look of like loose hairs and things.",
    "We take a pain like that, it can only do architectural drawings well.",
    "First of all thank you for the compliment, Getty on, but I don't think I would say you only do architectural drawings that's a?",
    "There's something quite complicated to do.",
    "I think that's pretty impressive.",
    "Yeah, I bet with the skills that you have doing architectural drawings.",
    "That's probably a really, really good starting point for drawing and painting any subject if you have.",
    "That kind of patience, especially I think you can do it if you want to get into painting a little bit more for fun.",
    "You should you should try.",
    "So for me, I started with traditional art, drawing and then I got into painting about 6 years ago, I got into digital art before that.",
    "I did traditional but I did specifically drawing so I didn't do any painting with color or used.",
    "All lines instead of instead of shapes so it was a really big adjustment for me at first getting into painting because that was a big difference.",
    "You know what I mean, it was definitely a big difference seeing things in shapes rather than outlines and it took me quite a while getting used to that.",
    "But my point is you can definitely shift that mindset or like sort of.",
    "Add to your Add something to your repertoire, you can totally do it.",
    "It's not like you're stuck you're stuck with that.",
    "One thing you can definitely expand it.",
    "Yeah, her hair over here is looking very, very smooth.",
    "I guess that's OK part of me wants to like bring some other textures and her hair, but I think if I zoom out and look at the overall image.",
    "It's probably for the best to keep her hair smooth.",
    "We've got a different texture going for the fabric for the background for the hair and skin so.",
    "Probably all right, the way it is.",
    "Oh, we never I never went back and did.",
    "A lot more work on the hands.",
    "Well, I guess they don't maybe need a lot more work, but I do want to add.",
    "I do want to add a fingernail at least to her one finger that we see against the face so let's do that.",
    "Did you do?",
    "Very important.",
    "Oops wrong layer.",
    "OK, so now we've got an outline of the fingernail.",
    "We don't have to get very detailed with this.",
    "It's for the best that we don't get very detailed with it because it's not really something we want to draw a lot of attention.",
    "But it's just the this looks a little odd if there's no fingernail.",
    "Yeah.",
    "So we can maybe give a little bit of a pink shade to the to the nail.",
    "I kind of would like to keep it.",
    "In a natural kind of color.",
    "I don't necessarily need it took like there's nail Polish or anything, but just you have a natural little bit of a huge shift there.",
    "And we can add a little bit of a shine or something like that.",
    "OK, I think that's enough.",
    "It's not something that I want to attract a ton of attention.",
    "Oh, thank you so much Karen.",
    "I'm really happy that it still full.",
    "That's awesome to hear if you if you ever have any questions or or anything, you're welcome to ask also.",
    "But well while I was zoomed in I think I think I will clean up some last little things on the.",
    "The hand here just maybe give little detail in between the fingers a tiny bit and.",
    "Just a little bit.",
    "Can always lower the opacity?",
    "Do make it a little bit softer?",
    "But we've got some hard edges because I originally painted this with the lasso tool.",
    "Up.",
    "Airbrush kind of combo.",
    "Just taking a moment to think about what else I might like to do.",
    "Make a new layer and grab the Airbrush.",
    "Um.",
    "Can add a little bit?",
    "More highlights to her skin and a little bit more of a pink Hue.",
    "Just get a little bit more depth to her to her skin.",
    "Funny I'm saying depth when I'm adding highlights but I think you know what I mean, a little bit more richness.",
    "You know a little bit more.",
    "Variety to the colors.",
    "So after I've been working on a painting for awhile.",
    "I've had this with a couple of streams.",
    "I'll tend to.",
    "Kind of put the painting aside and just return to it like the next day or in a few hours and just take one last look 'cause sometimes.",
    "I'll finish stream and I'll think I'm pretty happy with it, but later after taking a break and looking at it again.",
    "I'll find something that's standing out to me that I didn't really notice before so I think it's always nice if you don't have a deadline like uh if you don't have an immediate deadline, where you have to send something off to a client or or post it by a certain day.",
    "It's nice to give yourself a little bit of time to.",
    "To like take a fresh look at your image.",
    "Later.",
    "So I might do this do that with this one and maybe come back later and find that I want to.",
    "Fix something.",
    "Oh, thank you.",
    "Mills did I did I totally pass that.",
    "They totally passed that link.",
    "Wow, this is amazing.",
    "Guys check this out live avenged painted with bows.",
    "What a cool style I am loving your last couple black portraits that you painted with us?",
    "Really really cool.",
    "The backgrounds awesome.",
    "Yeah, it's cool to see how you stylize this.",
    "Isn't that pretty?",
    "Really nice texture to the hair.",
    "Nice job with the wrinkles and sweater details really cool.",
    "Oh yeah, I forgot about those extra leaves on the shoulder.",
    "I totally forgot about that.",
    "Well done well done livange.",
    "Thank you for sharing link with me Mills.",
    "Ah.",
    "That's amazing.",
    "Are you?",
    "I hope you're enjoying your paintings lately?",
    "I hope you're proud of them 'cause you should be?",
    "Hi there, MD on sale a high everyone.",
    "Welcome I'm just kind of finishing up a portrait painting here.",
    "Let me zoom out so you can see this is my reference here on the Top left, you can find a link to that, if you're interested below the stream in the description.",
    "So you guys, I'm going to try adding some last little highlights here compared to the reference my image is.",
    "A little bit less bright in the face so I'm going to come back in and add like one last.",
    "Pass of highlights like on the tip of the nose areas that are really getting hit by a bright light and there's a little bit of Sheen to her skin and there's a couple of places like this like above kind of above the eyebrow what I'm doing is I'm painting it in pretty boldly with a brush and then I'm going to use a smudge brush.",
    "To kind of?",
    "Blurry into her skin a little bit so it's going to appear really intense.",
    "At first, but then we're going to like tone, it down so don't worry.",
    "Don't worry.",
    "It's going to be.",
    "It's going to be OK.",
    "So painted in.",
    "Smudge it out if you go too much with these kind of highlights it ends up looking like.",
    "The person is a you know they just just got out of the shower or something there.",
    "It'll make them look wet or greasy or something.",
    "So we just want a little bit of like natural Sheen to the skin in a way that will feel.",
    "Nice usually I'll paint it.",
    "On one layer and then decide if we want to lower the opacity or something like that will decide if it's too much.",
    "Kind of feeling between they just draw that uh Oh.",
    "I see what I can prove.",
    "But overall, I'm happy that's a very good place to be and I think.",
    "That's a good spot to be in.",
    "It's always good to look for things to improve and be be aware of that.",
    "But at the same time, he definitely it's I think it's a It's always nice if you can at least find something in your painting that you like.",
    "You know.",
    "That helps keep.",
    "Keep things encouraging I think like for me.",
    "You know, I don't like all the paintings that I do of course, and I think everyone can relate.",
    "You like some you'll be happy with something and maybe not so much something else.",
    "Not every painting is going to go well.",
    "But if you can at least find something in there that you're like OK.",
    "I like how painted this one area that was cool.",
    "I learned something.",
    "And then move on to the next thing.",
    "I'll try to think next time, but I will promise it won't change to a building or something.",
    "That sounds that sounds like a deal.",
    "If you have been warned.",
    "Ah, thank you live in.",
    "A little bit of Sheen to the skin on the fingers or we're almost done.",
    "Like for this one, I could sit here and nitpick a little bit more.",
    "My painting, but I think it's OK to just say.",
    "I learned something I'm happy with something so not everything is OK and then put we learned into the next painting.",
    "What I'd like to improve from for the next one from this one is maybe maybe this skin?",
    "Maybe the skin could improve a little bit more.",
    "But.",
    "Anyway I think we're about done.",
    "I hope you guys like it.",
    "Um.",
    "I will probably like I said earlier.",
    "I'll probably take another look at this after taking a little break from working on it, and maybe I'll clean up some little things here, there if I see anything.",
    "I want to change, but I think this one is finished.",
    "I'm going to share in the chat a link to my Instagram so I post.",
    "My work here on behalf.",
    "Of course, but I generally like to post my favorite things or my more you know more of my like portfolio pieces here so.",
    "I'm a us some of the things that I paint on stream.",
    "I'll post here and some of them.",
    "I will probably just share on my Instagram or something like that, so if you really want to see the paintings.",
    "The finished ones posted somewhere you can check both places.",
    "But yeah, so this one will appear in one of those places when I decide how much I.",
    "How much I like it later but?",
    "I really enjoyed the stream.",
    "I'm so happy that a couple of you guys painted along.",
    "I love seeing what you did.",
    "You guys are welcome anyone who's listening in your welcome to join in next time if you like I am here every Wednesday and we do this and I share my references if you want to join in you can no pressure but?",
    "Thank you Jackson if anybody else was painting along and you want to share please.",
    "Go ahead and just let me know that way.",
    "I will make sure to wait for you, if you're busy right now with with uploading the image.",
    "I'll give you a little bit of time to do that.",
    "But we are reaching we're reaching the end, some last little finishing details and things I can show you in the mean time I don't think it's needed, so much on this one because I kind of addressed this earlier on.",
    "But one thing I do.",
    "Sometimes is make a new layer on Top of my painting and put it on multiply mode and I'll choose a color.",
    "Let's choose like a Brown and make a little bit of like a vignette around the outside.",
    "I try to be a little bit sparing with this because it can be very obvious and it can be a bit over.",
    "It can be too much.",
    "But just a little bit like I put it now at 20% just a little bit.",
    "You don't really notice and it.",
    "Let's you it kind of draws your eye in over from the edges in towards the center.",
    "Thank you a sling more.",
    "Thank you so much and thank you.",
    "Karen I appreciate it.",
    "Yes, there will be a recording Kevin after the stream ends.",
    "It takes a little bit of time to process the video, but later today if you.",
    "Check back on my page here on Behance.",
    "There's a videos tab and this will be there and all my past streams are there too.",
    "If you wanted to check those out and yeah.",
    "I'm sorry it's the end, but hopefully will see you next time if it's a good time for you, I'll be back next week.",
    "I started to dream about.",
    "About 4 hours.",
    "Ago now so I was trying to think of the easiest way to explain that I'm in C ET time.",
    "So yeah, but 12:30 my time, 4 hours ago and I'll be here again next week.",
    "Let's see what Lee art was up to.",
    "In it check out your painting woo, she looks so pretty.",
    "This is very cool.",
    "I really would like her face you always have a really good sense of the planes of the face.",
    "And proportions.",
    "Yeah, it's very solid, that's beautiful.",
    "Oh, thank you get him.",
    "Hi anchor, Hi Everybody.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Lee art that was quick also you kind of joined us, the nearer to the end, there, nicely done.",
    "So.",
    "Yeah, I think that's everything and less you guys, yeah, if anybody else, wanted to share your art.",
