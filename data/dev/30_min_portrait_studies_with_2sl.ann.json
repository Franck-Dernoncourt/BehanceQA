    "Sometimes if we spend too much time on one thing, it starts to look uneven.",

    "But that is just my process.",
    "It's not anything that you have to do for your drawing, just a personal.",
    "Personal thing on how I work.",
    "But it doesn't hurt to try it, right?",
    "Give it a try.",
    "And again, if you if you guys want to draw these references with me, feel free to snag the.",
